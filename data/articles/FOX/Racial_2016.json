            "article_content": "Presidential nominees clash at the first presidential debate at Hofstra University Monday\u2019s presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump coincided with the anniversary of the famous Nixon-Kennedy debate \u2013 the first major-party debate to be shown nationwide on television. Here\u2019s what\u2019s striking about what transpired 56 years ago in Chicago: the stage design was low-frills; JFK looked tan and rested; a pallid Richard Nixon showed the aftereffects of a knee infection. A Chicago Daily News headline captured the moment: \u201cWas Nixon Sabotaged by TV Makeup Artists?\u201d Lest we add talk of subterfuge to an election already fraught with conspiracies, here are five takeaways from what transpired in the first presidential debate of 2016. Trump\u2019s Performance. From the beginning, it was clear that Trump got the memo that this wasn\u2019t the same as one of his high-octane pep rallies (the subdued audience was his first tipoff). It was a far toned-down version from the Trump who stole the spotlight in the Republican primary debates. There was no mention of \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d Trump kept his powder dry as Clinton tried to touch a nerve by speculating that he might be shielding his tax returns because he\u2019s not as rich or charitable as he claims. When it came time to return fire, Trump went after Clinton\u2019s record (primarily, inconsistencies with stances she took back in the 1990\u2019s). But he didn\u2019t take the extra step, as he has so any times before in this election, by making it personal. An example: as Clinton was mocking his fortune, he didn\u2019t call her out for her and her husband\u2019s shortcuts to wealth. At the debate\u2019s end, when Clinton ripped Trump for his treatment of women, he didn\u2019t utter a word about her husband. Though he did infer he was thinking of going there, but chose not to: \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate. It\u2019s not nice.\u201d By the time the third debate rolls around, he might decide that enough is enough. Clinton\u2019s Performance. Madame Secretary\u2019s approach was two-pronged: keep smiling while she kept trying to get under Trump\u2019s skin. She did smile a lot. And she rarely missed a chance to stick a shiv into her opponent \u2013 in a personal way. Clinton sniped at Trump for taking money to start his business, alluded to his \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas, suggested his tax cuts would benefit his family and recited a list of terrible comments he\u2019s made with regard to the opposite sex. Clinton came loaded with facts and figures on the economy and crime. But she also overdid it on the pandering front \u2013 the worst moment being a passage in which she defended America\u2019s first black president, all but branded Trump a racist landlord, and then circled back to the glorious oratory of Michelle Obama at her party\u2019s convention. At least she didn\u2019t break out into \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d Lester Holt\u2019s Performance.\u00a0 On the day before the debate, Politico put out this story detailing the extent of recent Trump exaggerations and half-truths. Clinton supporters called it boffo journalism; Trump supporters claimed it was meant to put undue pressure on the moderator to hound Trump. Holt challenged Trump on \u201cfrisk and search\u201d and whether he opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Not so much did he stop Clinton and correct her statements. That won\u2019t go overlooked by media-bashers. Now, some criticism about Holt\u2019s choices. Given 90 minutes to ask Clinton and Trump why they\u2019re the most unpopular presidential candidates in 30 years, Holt didn\u2019t go there. He did push Trump on \u201cbirtherism\u201d; he didn\u2019t push Clinton on the skeletons in her closet. Other items Holt left off the table: immigration, climate change, Supreme Court appointments, and college tuition. Holt gave the two candidates a long leash \u2013 at times, too long, allowing for too much cross-talk and talking past each other. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a little more insight into the candidates\u2019 souls during their next two encounters. The Next 72 Hours and Beyond. The airwaves will crackle over the next 24 hours with talk of debate winners and losers. You\u2019re better off donning a pair of ear buds and drowning out the noise. Here\u2019s why: it\u2019ll take a couple of days for pollsters to see if the numbers actually moved after tonight. In 2012, Mitt Romney enjoyed what Gallup called \u201ca historic debate win\u201d after his first encounter with President Obama. A Gallup poll in the two days after that debate found 72 percent of viewers believing Romney did a better job \u2013 including 49 percent of Democrats. A five-point Obama lead evaporated. In 2012, the instant polls from the debate were in line with Gallup\u2019s findings \u2013 CNN and CBS News had Romney as the clear winner. Better to wait a few days until the head-to-head numbers are revisited (especially in the battleground states). And there\u2019s one other factor: how \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d satirizes things later this week, on its season premiere. Five days after the first Bush-Gore debate in 2000, SNL spoofed Al Gore\u2019s fondness for the word \u201clockbox\u201d (he said it seven times during the debate). It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal during the debate; Gore never shook off the caricature of a robotic stiff. Winner? If we must, round one . . . goes to Clinton \u2013 my scorecard had her ahead on points, with no knockdowns, so no lasting damage to Trump. Clinton was more composed on the stage and showed more command of the facts. She didn\u2019t cough (the medical story coming out of Hofstra: a sniffing Trump could have used a Neti Pot). In all, Clinton was more agile than Trump. However, she did nothing to address the elephant in the room \u2013 the public\u2019s lack of confidence in her honesty. She might want to rethink the attack-heavy approach before their next meeting. Trump struggled on two matters: birtherism and his tax returns. He kept his focus on a failed political system and effectively tagged Clinton on trade and political convenience \u2013 all the while reminding voters that Clinton\u2019s been a political presence for three decades now. However, Trump did little to assuage concerns that he\u2019s not temperamentally suited for the job. Much like another great conflict waged a century ago, both sides will claim they gained ground\u2013 only to retreat to their trenches. To be continued in St. Louis.",

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) President Obama used a pseudonym when sending or receiving emails through the private server system Hillary Clinton used as secretary of state, according to nearly 200 pages of documents released Friday by the FBI. Included in the documents are notes from an April 2016 interview with long-time Clinton aide Huma Abedin, conducted in connection with the FBI\u2019s two-year investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of the private server for official correspondence. One note was about the FBI showing Abedin an email address \u201cbelieved to be a pseudonym used by the President,\u201d as reported by Politico and other news-gathering agencies. Abedin said she didn\u2019t recognize the name and \u201cexpressed her amazement\u201d that Obama apparently used a pseudonym. She also exclaimed, \u201cHow is this not classified?\u201d according to the documents. That email exchange occurred on June 28, 2012, with the subject line \u201cCongratulations,\u201d perhaps regarding a Supreme Court ruling on ObamaCare. However, federal lawyers will not release the emails, citing executive privilege. The FBI concluded its investigation this summer, finding that several Clinton emails included at least parts of classified information and that the now-Democratic presidential nominee was \u201cextremely careless.\u201d However, the agency did not recommend criminal charges, and the investigation was concluded. Abedin also reportedly told the FBI that Clinton\u2019s team had to inform the White House that Clinton was changing her email address so that Obama could receive her messages.",

            "article_content": "Kristina Schake, deputy communications director for the Clinton campaign, explains decision, denies suggestion of trade-off PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she will soon step down as Democratic National Committee chairwoman, amid the fallout over leaked emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias in her operation -- a stunning development just hours before the start of her party's convention. In a written statement, the controversial party leader said she was \"privileged to serve as the DNC Chair for five and a half years.\" She said her first priority is serving the people of her Florida congressional district while stressing the importance of helping elect Hillary Clinton, adding: \"Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention.\" She said she would still \"open and close the convention,\" which begins Monday in Philadelphia, and address delegates \"about the stakes involved in this election,\" in her role as party chair. She apparently will step down at the end of the convention. Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile is slated to take over as interim chair during the rest of the general election campaign. The announcement came just hours after reports first surfaced that Wasserman Schultz may be denied a speaking role at the convention, and that she would not be presiding -- a decision apparently made under pressure from the Clinton campaign and the White House. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, will instead preside over the Democratic proceedings as convention chairwoman. On the sidelines, party officials were already discussing Wasserman Schultz' role as DNC chairwoman. One Democratic source told Fox News, \u201cDebbie is being forced out sooner than later.\u201d The rapid-fire set of developments ahead of the convention kick-off raise immediate questions about whether the party can unite its battling factions in Philadelphia this week. Officials were clearly trying to prevent anger over the email leak controversy and other issues from disrupting proceedings. The emails only bolstered claims from Sanders \u2013 and Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2013 that the system was rigged against the Vermont senator. Trump tweeted after the DNC news broke: Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) Sanders himself blasted the DNC and Wasserman Schultz in interviews earlier Sunday, demanding her resignation as party chairwoman. \u201cI think [Wasserman Schultz] should resign. Period. And I think we need a new chair who is going the lead us in a very different direction,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, hours before the resignation was announced. He later issued a statement thanking her for her service, and saying she made \"the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party.\" President Obama and Clinton both issued statements thanking Wasserman Schultz for her service. \"I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,\" Clinton said, adding that she will serve as \"honorary chair of my campaign's 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country\" and act as a surrogate. The WikiLeaks document dump, which included emails from January 2015 to May 2016, purportedly came from the accounts of seven DNC officials. In a May 5 email, a DNC employee asked a colleague to collect information on his religious beliefs \u2013 claiming it might sway voters in West Virginia and Kentucky. In that particular email, Sanders' name was not mentioned, but he was the only other candidate in the race at that time against Clinton. DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote, \u201cThis would make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.\u201d Others from Wasserman Schultz herself contained very strong language, raising questions about her status as an ostensibly neutral party official. Responding to Sanders\u2019 complaints the party hasn\u2019t been fair to him, she wrote to a staffer in an April email: \u201cSpoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.\u201d Responding to the same staffer a month later regarding Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver blaming the Nevada state party for a raucous convention, she wrote, \u201cDamn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans who are trying to keep their sole legislative seat in Chicago have spent more on television advertising there -- $2 million -- than for any other statehouse district race in the nation as they seek to loosen the Democrats' grip on Illinois. The figures, highlighted in a report released Thursday by the Center for Public Integrity, show the Chicago contest has helped make Illinois the biggest spender on TV ads for both GOP and Democratic legislative candidates in the U.S. for this election cycle to the tune of nearly $14 million since Jan. 1, 2015. Second in the U.S. is Florida with about $8 million. The staggering amount spent in Illinois reflects the struggle between GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic leaders amid an epic budget stalemate. Democrats are trying to strengthen their control of the Legislature while Rauner wants to give his party greater influence. The former venture capitalist has contributed $14 million of his own money to the Illinois Republican Party to support GOP candidates. With about a month left before the election, Republicans have paid nearly $2 million for ads to reach people in the Chicago district, where two years ago, a total of 30,000 voters cast ballots in the state House race. \"We are talking about unprecedented numbers,\" said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois in Springfield who specializes in campaign finance. It already was a record-busting year due to the most expensive legislative primary race in Illinois. Prior to this year, Redfield said the most spent on a legislative race was $3.6 million in 2014. The Chicago race pits GOP Rep. Michael McAuliffe, a 20-year veteran of the Illinois House, against Democrat Merry Marwig, a political newcomer on leave from her job at a Chicago software company. McAuliffe is the only Republican legislator in Chicago, representing what's considered a moderate district northwest of the city center that many police officers, firefighters, and teachers call home. The district includes part of Park Ridge, the neighborhood where Hillary Clinton grew up. Democrats have a comfortable supermajority in the state Senate, but in the House it's a fragile one. If any of the 71 Democrats defects, they lose their power to override Rauner's vetoes. McAuliffe's district is an appealing pick-up opportunity for Democrats, especially in a year when Clinton is running for president, so it's not unexpected for Republicans to try to defend his seat. Even so, the amount they're spending is remarkable. In 2012, for example, the Republicans' two major party committees spent just over $2 million combined on all races from July 1 through Sept. 30. \"They might be trying to dishearten the Democrats and their contributors to say, `How can we compete?\"' said Christopher Mooney, director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois. Some of the GOP-funded TV spots in the McAuliffe race are reaching people who aren't even in his district. During a Cubs game Aug. 1, Republicans spent $6,500 for a 30-second ad. His ads have run more than 1,000 times as of Monday, according to the Center for Public Integrity. For his part, McAuliffe seems a bit shy about the attention, saying he would prefer to get voters' attention in person. \"Just go door-to-door and just talk to voters like that,\" he said. The House Republican Organization, which receives its funding from the state GOP, has paid for most of McAuliffe's television advertising. Marwig, the Democrat, has spent about $187,690 on television ads so far, according to figures from the Center for Public Integrity. \"For me, this is about the concerns of our community and that's why I spend so much time out here talking to real people,\" she said Wednesday while walking the district. The $14 million spent so far on TV ads in Illinois includes $1.5 million spent by Juliana Stratton in the March primary to defeat fellow Democrat and incumbent Rep. Ken Dunkin, who broke with his party on key votes in the 2015 session. Both sides combined to spend more than $6 million on ad buys and other campaign expenses, a state record.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton delivers her acceptance speech at the DNC. (Reuters) Accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for president, Hillary Clinton declared the country is at a moment of reckoning. Here's the truth: America\u2019s economy is a mess and our social fabric is fraying. That's why Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton, offers a better way forward. Powerful computers, the Internet, handheld devices, robots and artificial intelligence are making our lives easier but they are also destroying jobs at an alarming pace. And the new opportunities those technologies create require better skills than most Americans have. Politicians have pumped billions into public schools and universities led by faculty obsessed with political correctness and the alleged ills of American capitalism, financed vast entitlements instead of adequate investments in R&D and the infrastructure, and sowed divisions and suspicion among ethnic groups, and between men and women and the prosperous and those genuinely deserving a hand up. Our High schools churn out students unprepared for college or vocational programs, and many university graduates lack the skills needed to function in a technology-intensive workplace. Businesses constantly complain about the shortage of adequately skilled job applicants. All this is exacerbated by competition from Japan, Germany and other northern European countries where job training is better and from China and elsewhere in Asia where labor is much cheaper. Those pressures are multiplied by Washington\u2019s failure to negotiate good international trade agreements and adequately defend Americans against foreign cheating on those agreements. Since 2000, a much smaller percentage of adults are working or looking for work, economic growth is half the pace of the prior 20 years, and average family incomes are down nearly $4,000. Suicides and drug abuse are up, fertility has dropped precipitously, millions of recent college graduates are employed at places like Starbucks and living with parents, and home ownership is at a 50 year low. American society is increasingly polarized between the top 25 percent who manage to obtain a good education, land a high paying job and pay most of the taxes, and those who are stuck in dead end situations and clamor for more government benefits to shore up their diminished circumstances. President Obama has pandered to the latter by expanding entitlements such as the earned income tax credit and food stamps, middle class subsidies for health insurance and student loans forgiveness, and social security disability pensions for 1 in 20 working age Americans. He tells the inadequately trained, minorities and women they are victims of forces beyond their control and entrenched discrimination, and pressures universities and businesses\u00a0 to implement racial and gender quotas in admissions and hiring. Those tactics win votes but discourage self-improvement and individual accountability, widen the skills gap between the haves and have-nots and further exacerbate inequality. Now Hillary Clinton wants to generalize to the national level the California Fair Pay Act, which would require businesses of all sizes to justify virtually every hiring and salary decision to the Labor Department, extend Medicare to Americans over 50, establish broad federal funding for child care, and offer most Americans free tuition at state universities. Already, the federal debt is on track to double over next 12 years, and Clinton\u2019s prescriptions would only slow growth further and hasten the ultimate collapse of the nation\u2019s finances. Donald Trump indicts the tyranny and destructive consequences of political correctness and identity politics. But no politician can run and win the presidency by promising to cut social programs. He does promise to do something about bad trade agreements and the high taxes smothering new business startups and investment. To lower taxes, he would be compelled by Congress to curtail the worst abuses of government benefits programs and thereby restore some individual responsibility to citizens for their successes and failures. Trump\u2019s language may be crude -- but after nearly 50 years in the trenches of academia, managing in government, advising corporate leaders and toiling in policy battles of Washington -- I can attest he is absolutely right. The problem he or any Republican faces running for president is that too many Americans have become dependent on government largess and preferences for employment opportunities. None can speak honestly without being branded a racist, sexist, homophobe or simply insensitive, and ridiculed to their demise in the New York Times, Washington Post and major network newscasts. With each new president, more Americans go on the dole or benefit from some kind of government mandated sinecure and fewer are engaged in productive activities. \u00a0Growth slows further, the debt increases and opportunities for young people become less adequate. This can only end by Americans rejecting Clinton and voting for Trump to take back their dignity, or the country falling into complete dysfunction, decay and ultimate collapse.",

Sign up\u00a0here.**On the roster: Captive Rubio symbolizes GOP struggle - Early voting begins in the Buckeye State - Clinton aides discuss \u2018acceptable\u2019 conservative faiths - Audible: Ughhhhhh - Swim for it, boys!CAPTIVE RUBIO SYMBOLIZES GOP STRUGGLE The wave of fear and outrage after the revelation of Donald Trump\u2019s creepy banter with a fellow celebrity seems to have crested. Republicans who joined the misguided movement to call for him to step down \u2013 as if such a thing were really possible \u2013 are crawling back. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Republican Senate nominee in Colorado, Daryl Glenn, found that the time between denunciations and calls for withdrawal to shrugging acceptance was only about 72 hours. Those who tried to adopt a middle position between disavowal and continued support found themselves squished in the middle of the road. That number does not include Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who was quiet during the cresting wave of outrage. But on Tuesday confirmed that he remained exactly where he has been: unhappily, but resolutely for Trump. \u201cI wish we had better choices for President,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cBut I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next President. And therefore my position has not changed.\u201d And no one can say that it hasn\u2019t been working for him. Despite his awkward embrace of Trump, through it all, Rubio remains 7 points ahead of Rep. Patrick Murphy in the latest poll of their Senate contest. By standing by Trump, Rubio was spared from inclusion in Trump\u2019s latest fatwas against his party. As David Drucker describes, Trump\u2019s war on Republicans is something we\u2019ve never seen in politics before. Had Rubio defied Trump with something like Fischer\u2019s misbegotten bid to have her cake and eat it too, one can imagine that Trump\u2019s Panama City, Fla. rally on Tuesday night would\u2019ve turned into a rip-Rubio session with all the old gags and insults packed in, \u201csweaty,\u201d \u201cliddle Marco,\u201d the amnesty fan. Rubio also can be cheered by the fact that Republicans are mostly standing behind Trump. The quarter of elected Republican officials found in a USA Today survey to be against Trump, constitutes a significant, but ineffectual minority. What Rubio has to worry about though is whether there will be anything left of him at the end. As part of the bid by Julian Assange and his benefactors in Moscow and elsewhere to scuttle Clinton\u2019s chances, a bit about Rubio dribbled out. It\u2019s impossible to say whether the email from senior Clinton strategist Joel Benenson about Rubio is legit. But Clinton has corroborated other hacks, and it certainly has the ring of truth. In a February 2015 email to his colleagues, Benenson allegedly expressed his \u201canxiety thought of the day\u201d about Rubio. This was in the midst of Republicans tumbling head over feet trying to deal with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s claim that Barack Obama didn\u2019t really love his country. While many Republicans were afraid to confront the hottest cauldron of Obama hatred in their party, Rubio jumped right out and said that he believed Obama was patriotic, and pivoted to an attack on the president\u2019s policies. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to worry more about Rubio than the others,\u201d Benenson allegedly wrote, \u201cHe\u2019s playing this very smart \u2013 only one who didn\u2019t duck like a chicken [s***] on the Q of whether POTUS loves America.\u201d Benenson went on to talk about whether Rubio would be well suited to beat Clinton in a change election given his youth and verve as well as his appeal to Hispanic voters. \u201cHe has stronger right wing cred than Jeb,\u201d Benenson is said to have written. \u201cAnd he\u2019s finding a way to the middle enough for now and he will be the most exciting choice to Republicans.\u201d This jibes with what former Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer wrote in an op-ed last November: \u201cThere is no question that Rubio is the Republican that Democrats fear most.\u201d Would Pfeiffer and Benenson say the same things today? Probably not. Rubio is making the point that many in his party are: that an expected Trump loss will be like other losses of the past. Rubio supported Mike Huckabee in the 2008 Republican primaries but that didn\u2019t impinge on his options four years later. Of all of the weakest sauce in political attacks, trying to make a candidate take responsibility for another politician\u2019s positon is pretty hard. But will Trump be different? Rubio bets not, and so do other potential future leaders of the GOP, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Others like Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are making a different calculation. Whether Trump succeeds in breaking the party or not, Sasse & Co. are wagering that backing Trump will be treated differently than prior nominees and will in fact be a litmus test in the future. Whatever the future holds though, there will be a cost for Trump support and a cost for Trump refusal. Rubio, once the Republican Democrats feared most, is staking a great deal on the premise that the cost will be higher for the Trump refuseniks. What he can\u2019t know, however, is how history will judge Trump and the Republicans who supported him.THE RULEBOOK: CHECK YOURSELF\u201cIn the legislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government, though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the majority.\u201d\u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 70TIME OUT: RETHINKING THE STORMIN\u2019 NORMAN William the Conqueror\u00a0is known to history as a villain who tried to take over England.

            "article_content": "Frank Luntz polls his focus group **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up\u00a0here.** NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2013 You could still say the race was wide open, but after Thursday\u2019s debate, that would be a lie. The Fox Business Network\u2019s faceoff offered a hopeful glimmer for Republicans wondering when they will get past the preliminaries and on to the business of picking a presidential nominee. This long-running television show is about to see a spinoff. Call it \u201cThe Contenders.\u201d It won\u2019t happen all at once, but the trio of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio stood far enough above the rest of the field here that you could, for the first time, really sense the separation of the two tiers on the debate stage. This happened much earlier in the previous presidential cycle, in which there had already been 13 debates by this point, instead of six. But after a late start and five months of slow going, the debates are beginning to do their job: To reveal for GOP voters the strengths and weaknesses of their candidates. Part of the frustration for anyone watching the prior debates was that no one was both willing and able to take on frontrunner Trump directly. Some combination of calculation, cowardice and incompetence had kept the whole field iced against the guy who polls say is walking away with their nomination. The race had a frontrunner who for months was treated like a marginal candidate on debate stages. While seventh- and eighth-place cellar dwellers raged at each other and drew approving pundit nods, Trump was left alone at center stage pulling faces and rolling his eyes. But finally, finally, finally Cruz treated Trump like a serious candidate. And Cruz did what any Texan would do if you called him a Canadian: He fought. And for the first time, someone actually bested Trump in a head-to-head showdown. It was a seismic shift in the race if only because it proved that it was even possible. But it was more than that. It was Cruz\u2019s announcement of his arrival as a real contender. When Trump got tripped up and admitted that his Canadian birtherism was, in fact, motivated by Cruz\u2019s rising stature in the race, it was the first clean, clear defeat Trump had taken on stage to another candidate. Cruz flipped a negative into a positive, and that\u2019s the highest art in all politics. But just about the time Cruz was getting cocky, Trump not only came alive but delivered what was the single best answer of his debate career thus far. Cruz had laid it on way too thick in his answer about what he meant when he accused Trump of having \u201cNew York values.\u201d When Trump answered, he took everything you knew about him and threw it out on its ear. Trump spoke tenderly and so softly that the audience needed to lean in to hear him tell the story of 9/11 and reminded his now-rapt that \u201ceverybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.\u201d It was a grand slam. We already knew that Trump could shout down or insult a rival. What we hadn\u2019t seen him do on stage is show this kind of range in so doing. Trump has continued to improve as a debater and a candidate, and in this one answer was all the proof you need. For Rubio, boffo debate performances are the norm. His mix of high energy and a broad grasp of issues is a lethal combination in this setting. In debates, like your high-school diver\u2019s ed class, speed kills. While one could argue that Rubio had one of his best showings so far, winning rounds with Cruz and others, what really made this debate different for Rubio was the obvious separation between him and the other four candidates on stage not named Trump or Cruz. For the other four, each debate brings the promise that this time will be the breakout performance or that this time they will really get tough. Well, we\u2019re pretty well out of this times with 17 days before the first contest starts. Rubio, on the other hand, started at good and has moved to great. Now, this is not to say that things can\u2019t change. Certainly a stunning victory in any of the four early states could vault someone other than the top three into contention. And the opposite is true. Any of the three is only a few bad days away from bottom-tier oblivion. Despite a promising path to the nomination, Rubio\u2019s position is the most precarious of the big three, mostly because he is the one in closest reach to the bottom quartet. If Rubio powers past them in Iowa and New Hampshire, we will be off into a three-way sprint. If one of the others can trip him up, Cruz and Trump might run away on their own. This has been a trying primary season for Republicans so far: Too many candidates, too much noise and too few clear scenarios that put a strong candidate into the general election season. After this debate, they can finally start to picture the world differently. Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.",

            "article_content": "   The Koenigsegg Agera R, the holder of six production car records, has finally been launched on the American market. The Swedish supercar made its official North American debut at the recent Pebble Beach Concours d\u2019Elegance where the founder of Koenigsegg, Christian von Koenigsegg, was able to greet fans as well as potential buyers. In case you want to be among the fortunate few who are able to call themselves Koenigsegg owners, you had better hope you can afford the price of entry, which for the latest Agera R starts from about $1.5 million. Of course, there\u2019s a long list of options to be had, especially now that Koenigsegg is offering customers a range of options through a new bespoke personalization service. Suffice it to say, that $1.5 million starting price can quickly reach the $2-million mark and beyond. Matters of money will be quickly forgotten once hopping behind the wheel of the Agera R, however. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V-8, which is rated at 960 horsepower on regular pump gas or up to 1,140 horsepower when running on E85 fuel. That much power translates to a power-to-weight ratio of 2.6 pounds per horsepower, which is why the Agera R dishes out 0-60 mph times of just 2.9 seconds (with launch control) and is claimed to be able to reach a top speed of 273 mph--5 mph more than the fastest Veyron. Read: Hennessey planning record run for 275 mph Venom GT supercar The Agera R also gets a host of new technologies including hollow carbon fiber wheels to shed weight, nano-surfaced cylinder sleeves to reduce friction and Formula 1-style pushrod suspension. The Pebble Beach Concours is the only North American show where Koenigsegg currently makes an appearance. If you happened to miss them this year, the company has confirmed it will be out on the lawns at next year\u2019s event. View original post",

            "article_content": "A group backed by the New York hedge fund billionaire George Soros, a longtime bankroller of liberal political causes, is mailing anti-Joe Arpaio fliers to Phoenix-area voters shown here, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) PHOENIX \u2013 Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America who could face criminal charges for ignoring a judge's order to stop targeting Latinos in anti-immigration roundups, may now have a new foe as he seeks re-election \u2014 George Soros, the billionaire liberal hedge fund tycoon. The Republican sheriff already was battered politically and support for him had been slipping when a group linked to Soros mounted an anti-Arpaio attack in an attempt to weaken his bid for a seventh straight term. The group started sending fliers to Phoenix-area voters two weeks ago, and a mailing last week accuses Arpaio of separating a mother from her child because of an unpaid traffic ticket, botching hundreds of sex crimes investigations and scaring immigrants so much that that they don't report crime. Arpaio denies the claims and is easily capable of striking back with a formidable $2.9 million still available for campaign spending ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, dwarfing the total $326,000 raised by his challenger, Democrat Paul Penzone, a former Phoenix police sergeant who lost to Arpaio by 6 percentage points in 2012. But the entry of a Soros-linked group is a gift for Penzone, who acknowledges he'll never come close to matching Arpaio's campaign spending. Over the last year, Soros contributed $3.9 million to Democrats in law enforcement political races in Chicago, St. Louis, Orlando, Houston, Albuquerque, Lowndes County in Mississippi and Caddo Parish in Louisiana, according to campaign finance records. Of the seven district attorney candidates Soros-linked groups have backed, two have already been elected and four won primaries. Only one lost. In New Mexico, Soros gave $107,000 to Raul Torrez, the winner of the Democrat primary in June for the county that encompasses Albuquerque \u2014 prompting Republican Simon Kubiak to drop out. Kubiak said he guaranteed Torrez victory because he could not raise the money he would have needed to counterattack and because he feared a barrage of negative ads. \"I would have accepted it, too,\" Kubiak said of Soros' donation to Torrez. Officials with the billionaire's Soros Fund Management referred comment on Soros' political donations to Michael Vachon, a top Soros adviser who serves as his personal spokesman. Vachon did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The new anti-Arpaio group, Maricopa Strong, registered in Arizona on Aug. 29, the day before Arpaio won his Republican primary against three opponents. It is not required to file a report detailing who made donations and spending until Sept. 29. But county records state Maricopa Strong's chairwoman is Whitney Tymas, a former public defense attorney in New York and Virginia prosecutor who serves as treasurer for the Soros-funded Safety & Justice national political committee and groups with similar names in Illinois, Florida, Texas and New Mexico. Tymas did not respond to repeated phone and email messages seeking comment, and Maricopa Strong spokeswoman Tania Torres did not respond when asked by telephone and email if Soros had provided the group with funding. The tenor of the ads shown for various local races and past positions by Soros-backed groups indicate he's focused on reducing perceived racial disparities within the criminal justice system. His super political action committee gave more than $14 million from 2015-16, including big sums to organizations trying to elect Hillary Clinton. The anti-Arpaio flier accuses him of being \"obsessed with immigrants at the expense of his job\" and of making \"immigrant communities scared to report crime for fear they will be harassed by the Sheriff's Office.\" The 84-year-old Arpaio has denied he is anti-immigrant and that his unfinished business includes an overhaul of his office after his officers were found by a federal judge to have racially profiled Latinos in traffic patrols that made him a national figure in the immigration debate. Arpaio was found in civil contempt for failing to stop the patrols after the judge ordered them halted in December 2011. Federal prosecutors are deciding whether to file a criminal contempt-of-court case against him punishable by up to six months of jail time if classified as a misdemeanor and an unspecified sentencing range if deemed a felony. The list of local law and order campaigns Soros has bankrolled have targeted other incumbents criticized for decisions involving race. They include a $408,000 donation to a first-time candidate for prosecutor in Chicago who won the Democratic primary in March against an incumbent criticized for charging a white police officer a full year after the officer shot a black teenager dead. In Florida, the incumbent prosecutor for the Orlando area known for prosecuting the Casey Anthony case attributed Soros' money to tipping voters against him during the last month of his campaign before the Aug. 30 primary. Jeff Ashton said opponent Aramis Alaya gained momentum after a Soros-funded group started running a TV spot on alleged legal system racial disparities. \"She was done,\" Ashton said. \"And then the huge amount of money started pouring in.\" Funding by the new anti-Arpaio group could also impact the presidential race because Arpaio is a strident Donald Trump supporter. Democrats hope to rally Arizona's Latinos \u2014 a voting bloc including many who have long reviled the sheriff \u2014 to show up to vote for Clinton in November. Chad Willems, the sheriff's campaign manager, said he suspected a well-funded anti-Arpaio group from outside Arizona would get involved in the campaign but doubted it would prevent Arpaio from winning. \"He is a known commodity here. The voters do still like him,\" Willems said. Penzone said in an interview that he has had no contact with Maricopa Strong or Soros and doubted money funneled into the race would level the playing field because Arpaio has so much. He has spent $8.9 million on his campaign so far. The development does show that some people outside Arizona want Arpaio out, Penzone said. \"With his name recognition and tenure in office and all that money, he is still falling short of expectations,\" Penzone said.",

U.S. District Judge John Jarvey rejected a request to quash a warrant ordering Google to give the FBI the contents of Jesse Benton's Gmail account, which he used to work on Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election bid. Benton had been leading a super PAC supporting Rand Paul's presidential campaign until he was indicted earlier this month. He and two other top aides from Ron Paul's 2012 campaign are charged with conspiring to secretly pay off an Iowa state senator to endorse Paul before that year's Iowa caucuses. They pleaded not guilty in an Iowa federal court. Under Jarvey's order, Google will be legally required to divulge tens of thousands of emails sent and received by Benton between March 2011 and July 2014. Guy Cook, a lawyer for Google, said Friday that the company would respect the order. Lawyers for Benton and the Justice Department declined to comment. Jarvey's ruling appears to end a dispute that has gotten attention in libertarian and technology circles as a test of the government's ability to broadly review email accounts during criminal investigations. Benton gave the FBI permission to search the account last year, but he withdrew it days later after investigators started combing through his email. An FBI agent then applied for a warrant to search and seize parts of the account, which a magistrate judge approved based on probable cause that a crime was committed. After Google received the warrant, the company told Benton that it intended to comply with the request unless he filed a legal challenge. Benton's attorney filed a motion to quash the warrant, arguing that it was overly broad, violated his privacy rights and amounted to a fishing expedition. Prosecutors argued that the warrant was lawful and tailored to the evidence of wrongdoing they had uncovered related to improper payments to Sen. Kent Sorenson, who flipped from supporting Michele Bachmann to Ron Paul days before the 2012 caucuses. U.S. Magistrate Judge Helen Adams upheld the warrant Aug. 10. Google then sought to give Benton time to appeal the order, resisting the government's request to immediately produce the emails. Adams last week put the ruling on hold so Benton could appeal to the district judge, Jarvey, who sided with the government in a terse order Friday. He said the law doesn't give Benton the ability to challenge the execution of a search warrant beforehand. Instead, Benton could later seek to suppress any emails the government wants to use against him in the criminal case by arguing their seizure was unconstitutional. Prosecutors have said they will review the emails and seize only those that are relevant to their investigation. They pledge to filter out all others, including those protected by attorney-client privilege.",

            "article_content": "A new memo sent by Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook declares Clinton \u201chas many paths to 270 electoral votes, while Donald Trump has very few\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s right, but Trump\u2019s potential path to victory looks a bit wider than it did a month ago. The race across the battleground states has tightened considerably, according to Fox News projections released Tuesday. While Clinton still has the overall Electoral College advantage, the Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows the race between Clinton and Donald Trump becoming more competitive in New Hampshire, Colorado and even Minnesota \u2013 and Trump gaining the edge in Iowa. In New Hampshire, both campaigns are fiercely fighting for the state\u2019s mere four Electoral College votes. Clinton had held a lead in the state, but Trump looks to have closed the gap. Clinton also had long looked to be comfortably ahead in Colorado, but she failed to lock the state down. Her campaign even pulled down TV ads in the state. Clinton still has some advantages in the Centennial State, but polls show a tightened race \u2013 one recent poll showed Trump ahead. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s polling lead in Iowa, a state with a lot of working-class white voters, has grown more comfortable. The state has gone Democratic in five of the last six presidential elections, but it looks friendlier to Trump than most of the other battleground states. Minnesota still looks like a state that the Democrats can hold, but Trump appears to have a small chance of expanding the map into this long solidly blue state. Other battlegrounds -- North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona -- are all still rated as \u201ctoss-ups\u201d in the latest projections. And while polls have tightened in Virginia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Clinton continues to have an edge in all of them. Overall, Clinton\u2019s electoral edge remains significant. If Clinton wins the states rated \u201csolid\u201d Democrat along with the states rated as leaning in her direction, she\u2019d have 260 electoral votes. If Trump wins the \u201csolid\u201d Republican states along with the states currently seen as leaning in his direction, he\u2019d come away with 170 electoral votes. Neither candidate, though, reaches the 270 electoral votes needed to win the 2016 presidential election without winning some of the toss-up states, which hold 108 electoral votes.",

(CBS News via AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 Donald Trump suggests in a videotaped deposition released Friday that his presidential campaign could boost business at his hotels and increase the value of his personal brand. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brian Holeman ordered the release of Trump's deposition from June following requests filed by news organizations. Though a transcript of Trump's testimony was previously filed publicly, the Republican presidential nominee's lawyers asked the judge to seal the video. Holeman refused. Trump's company sued Geoffrey Zakarian last year when the restaurateur withdrew from his lease to open a high-end eatery in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington after the candidate characterized Mexicans as being criminals, drug dealers and rapists. Trump testified he didn't think his widely criticized comments were harmful because he went on to beat a roster of \"highly respected\" candidates, including senators and governors. to win the GOP presidential primary. \"So it's not like, you know, like I've said anything that could be so bad,\" Trump said. \"Because if I said something that was so bad, they wouldn't have had me go through all of these people and win all of these primary races.\" Zakarian followed suit after Spanish-American chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s withdrew from his deal to open a different restaurant in the luxury hotel, citing Trump's derogatory comments. Trump sued both for breach of contract, seeking damages and lost rent in excess of $10 million from each. Trump said the men pulled out because \"they thought I made statements that were inflammatory in some form,\" but added that he was surprised they withdrew. He said he thought the men had made a big mistake, and he expected his Washington hotel to be a great success. Trump disputed media reports that occupancy at his hotels slumped after he announced his presidential bid last year, saying business had been steady or even better at his resort properties. He specifically cited the example of his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. \"The manager told me recently, he said, 'Boy this is the best \u2014 it is actually the best year we've ever had a Mar-a-Lago,'\" Trump recounted, adding that the manager attributed the uptick in business to the campaign. Trump said it was difficult to put a precise value on his personal brand, but said his company had previously commissioned a study that put the worth of the Trump name as being in excess of $2 billion. Asked to predict how his presidential bid would affect the value of his properties, Trump said time will tell \u2014 especially depending on whether he wins in November. \"We're going to know in five months, right?\" Trump said in June. \"But it's been, you know, it's been a lot of wins. We've beaten a lot of people. And I think people like that. So I think ... it will be great for the building in question.\"",

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (The Associated Press) A Code Pink activist is covered by American flags during the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Tuesday, July 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (The Associated Press) People walk on the floor before the start of the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Tuesday, July 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (The Associated Press) The United States depicted at the Republican National Convention is a scary place. It is wrenched by economic uncertainty, social upheaval, political dysfunction, runaway immigration, violent streets and existential threats from abroad. Republicans want voters to see the need for drastic change. The nation's only choice, they say, is Donald Trump. Why Republicans would paint such a bleak portrait and whether things really are as they say: WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? GOP Chairman Reince Priebus opened the convention acknowledging \"troubling times.\" Others used less measured terms. Americans live in fear, they said. The country is disrespected by the world, its military is gutted, its police are shamed. Borders are porous. Terrorism is a constant threat. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said the U.S. suffers from \"an economic disaster ... and the American people know it.\" Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said \"our allies see us shrinking from our place as a leader in the world.\" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani pointed to \"the terrorists who are killing us and our allies.\" He concluded: \"There is no next election. ... There's no more time for us left to revive our great country.\" ___ WHAT'S THE REALITY? The United States has seen some tough times, but it is in better shape than most of the world. Americans are still much less likely to become victims of domestic or international terrorism than most Europeans and citizens of Middle East nations. Violent crime in the United States has dropped steadily since 1992, according to FBI statistics. In May, unemployment dipped to its lowest rate since November 2007, a year before Obama's election. The economy has grown for much of Obama's tenure. But the middle class has taken a hit. Average household incomes are rising, but that's largely due to higher pay for the richest 10 percent of American households. Still, the United States is outperforming most of the world's advanced economies. Last year, the U.S. economy grew 2.4 percent, compared to 0.5 percent in Japan, 2.2 percent in Britain and 1.7 percent in the 19 countries that share the euro currency. China, which Trump often says has out-maneuvered the U.S. on economic matters, is growing faster than the United States. But the U.S. is far richer: Economic output per person last year was $56,000 in the U.S. and $7,900 in China. ___ HOW DO AMERICANS SEE IT? It's a mixed answer. Though Obama's job approval ratings have been positive for much of 2016, Americans are anxious. A recent Associated Press GfK-Poll found almost 4 out of 5 American voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. And there's a seemingly never-ending cycle of bad news: a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida; assassinations of police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas; and high-profile killings of black men by police. ___ THE POLITICS Tapping into Americans' anxiety \u2014 and deepening it \u2014 may be a logical strategy for Trump to win over moderate Democratic and independent voters. He entered the convention trailing Clinton in most polls. His favorability ratings are extremely low, even worse than Clinton's dismal numbers. Conventions normally offer candidates an opportunity to introduce themselves to Americans who don't follow politics too closely. Trump is already extremely well-known and will have a hard time changing voters' opinions about him. However, no one can deny that Trump is the candidate of change. Clinton has been running as the candidate who will build on Obama's legacy. If voters agree that things are truly awful and the country needs a dramatic change, the only candidate who fits the bill is the brash, tough-talking billionaire developer and reality star. ___ THERE'S A HISTORY A party out of the White House for two terms tends to frame the current leadership as a failure. Accepting his nomination in 2008, Obama declared: \"We are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight.\" Ronald Reagan ousted Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980 amid economic and international turmoil. Yet Reagan and Obama wove an intrinsic optimism into their arguments. Obama's slogan was \"Hope and Change.\" Reagan summoned biblical imagery to describe the United States as a \"shining city on a hill.\" Trump's pitch is perhaps most comparable to Richard Nixon's law-and-order campaign in 1968, another turbulent year at home and abroad. Nixon told Republicans in his acceptance speech that \"America is trouble today,\" mired in war \"with no end in sight\" and unable \"to manage its own economy.\" Trump insists his motto \u2014 \"Make America Great Again\" \u2014 is optimistic. But the subtext is his indictment of a nation that \"never wins anymore.\" He suggests stability and greatness will re-emerge because of his touch, rather than something inherent in the American people. ___ AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Flanagan reported for WDBJ under the name Bryce Williams The former television reporter who gunned down two journalists and wounded a third person on live television Wednesday morning -- apparently out of anger over the Charleston, S.C., church shootings -- killed himself as police closed in on him along a Virginia highway. A picture is emerging of 41-year-old Vester Lee Flanagan, who professionally went by the name Bryce Williams, as someone who was difficult to work with, easily offended and sometimes feared in the newsroom. In between his murderous rampage Wednesday morning and the time he ended his life with a self-inflicted gunshot wound before Noon, Williams sent a manifesto full of his angry ranting to ABC News. \"Yes, it will sound like I am angry...I am,\" the document reportedly states. \"And I have every right to be. But when I leave this Earth, the only emotion I want to feel is peace....\" Williams had called ABC News during the last few weeks trying to pitch a story, the organization said. A long fax from Williams was received by ABC on Wednesday morning timestamped at 8:26 -- more than an hour and a half after the shooting occurred. Williams later called the network saying that police were \"after me\" and \"all over the place.\" In the faxed document, Williams used the June shooting at a Charleston church as part of the reason for his crime. Dylann Roof is alleged to have shot several black parishioners during that mass killing. Later in the document, Williams expressed admiration for Virginia Tech shooter Seung Hui Cho and the Columbine High School killers. Williams also listed numerous grievances including racial discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying while at work. Williams said he was attacked for being a gay, black man. \"The [Charleston] church shooting was the tipping point\u2026but my anger has been building steadily...I've been a human powder keg for a while\u2026just waiting to go BOOM!!!!\" Under the professional name of Bryce Williams, Flanagan had previously served as a reporter for TV station WDBJ7 -- the same network whose reporters he targeted Wednesday morning. Williams was fired from WDBJ7 several years ago and had to be escorted off the station grounds by police, according to WDBJ7 President and General Manager Jeff Marks. \"Eventually after many incidents of his anger ... we dismissed him,\" Marks said. \"He did not take that well.\" Williams filed a complaint, alleging racism, with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, though Marks said that charge was dismissed. A Twitter account belonging to Williams tweeted out what appeared to be first-person video of the shooting along with statements pointing to a motive. \"Alison made racist comments,\" one tweet from Williams' now-suspended Twitter account read, referring to one of the victims, 24-year-old Alison Parker. \"Adam went to hr on me after working with me one time!!!\" said another, referring to another victim, 27-year-old Adam Ward. Both tweets were posted hours after the murders had occurred. A Facebook account under Williams' name posted a longer version of the video. The Twitter and Facebook accounts have since been suspended. In the Twitter video, a first-person camera angle shows Williams walking up to a reporter, interviewee and camera man and pointing a gun at them. The trio, in the midst of the interview, does not see Williams approach or the pistol pointing at them. Williams initially stops near the group and points the gun away. After a few seconds, he aims again and begins firing, first at reporter Alison Parker, who screams and runs as the video ends. In the longer video posted to Facebook the sound of at least 14 gunshots can be heard. Nine shots ring out before a pause and the final shots are fired. Police found a vehicle belonging to Williams at the Roanoke Airport before 11 a.m., but he was not with the car. Trooper P. M. Neff later used a license plate reader to track down Williams in a second vehicle, a Chevrolet Sonic, sometime before 11:30 a.m. Neff said when she initially caught up to Williams, his car was not travelling over the speed limit. Once other cops joined her pursuit, Neff turned her lights on and police closed in on the Sonic. Williams led them on a short chase of \"less than two miles,\" police said, before he eventually ran off the road and was found with a gunshot wound near mile marker 17 on I-66. Flanagan was airlifted to the hospital with critical injuries and he died as a result of the self-inflicted gunshot wound around 1:30 p.m., police said during a Wednesday afternoon press conference. \u201cWe always say \u2018senseless\u2019 crime. How can this individual have robbed Alison and Adam\u2019s families of their lives and loves?\u201d The two people killed were identified by WDBJ7 colleagues as Parker and Ward. The third person shot by Williams was identified as Vicki Gardner. She was being interviewed by Parker at the time she was wounded. Shot in the back, Gardner had surgery and is recovering. Gardner is head of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce. The shooting occurred at 6:45 a.m. at Bridgewater Plaza in Moneta, Va. during a story about a planned anniversary celebration at Smith Mountain Lake. \"[Gardner] is currently recovering and is in stable condition,\" Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital CEO Steve Arner said in a statement. An image from the Facebook page of Bryce Williams. Williams was the name Vester Lee Flanagan used as a reporter. The trio was surprised by gunfire live on television. Viewers initially saw a panned shot of the scenery as Parker and Gardner spoke. When the camera panned back to Parker and Gardner, multiple gun shots rang out and several screams could be heard followed by a female yelling \"Oh my God.\" As the camera fell to the ground, the blurry figure of the gunman came into view on the screen momentarily, the last image Ward's camera ever transmitted. The live feed then cut off. \u201cWe always say \u2018senseless\u2019 crime,\u201d Marks said on air later. \u201cHow can this individual have robbed Alison and Adam\u2019s families of their lives and loves?\u201d WDBJ7 tweeted about the incident Wednesday morning: Ward graduated from Salem High School and Virginia Tech and Parker grew up in Martinsville and attended Patrick Henry Community College and James Madison University, according to WDBJ7. Parker interned at the station while at James Madison, and said in a station news release when they announced her hiring: \u201cIt was that internship that took the skills I learned at JMU and allowed me to apply them. That internship made me fall in love with the business, and I knew broadcast journalism was exactly what I wanted to pursue.\u201d Colleagues revealed on air that Parker was dating a coworker at the station and Ward was engaged to a coworker. Chris Hurst, a WDBJ7 anchor, tweeted Wednesday morning that he was romantically involved with Parker: \"We were together almost nine months. It was the best nine months of our lives. We wanted to get married.We just celebrated her 24th birthday. She was the most radiant woman I ever met. And for some reason she loved me back. She loved her family, her parents and her brother.\" Reporter Alison Parker, left, was killed on live television Wednesday morning. She was dating coworker Chris Hurst. (Courtesy of Chris Hurst on Twitter) Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a statement he was \"heartbroken\" by the news. \u201cThere are no words to express how heartbroken I am by the senseless tragedy in Moneta this morning,\" the statement said. \"My deepest sympathies go out to the loved ones of Alison Parker and Adam Ward, as well as the entire WDBJ family. I ask everyone to join me in praying for Vicki Gardner who was seriously injured in this attack and all of the local authorities and first responders who are working to find the perpetrator of this horrific crime.\u201d The NYPD said it stepped up its presence around TV stations on Wednesday in New York as a precaution. \"Out of an abundance of caution the NYPD's Counterterrorism Bureau, Critical Response Vehicles and Hercules Teams have been deployed to television news outlets in New York City,\" said Deputy Commissioner for Counterterrorism and Intelligence John J. Miller. \"This was ordered following the shooting this morning in Virginia. While there is no indication of any threat to media outlets beyond this incident, we have provided an additional layer of security until we have a fuller understanding of the motive behind the Virginia incident.\" Moneta is about 25 miles east of Roanoke.",

            "article_content": "FILE -- Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (AP) Hillary Clinton likely dodged criminal charges Tuesday for a simple reason: the bar for bringing criminal charges against a politician, particularly a high public official, is so much higher than they are for anyone else. Prosecutions against such high public officials only go forward when there is \u201cdefinitive\u201d evidence.\u00a0 Evidence that prosecutors know will lead to a certain conviction. Why do I say that? Because earlier in my career I was chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission. I worked frequently with prosecutors. The reputational loss public officials face from criminal charges can be so great that prosecutors feel that they need to be sure of a conviction before going forward. For someone running for president, such as Hillary, that loss of reputation would be tremendous. -- It isn\u2019t as if she will be able to pick right back up where she is now in the 2020 presidential race. So much of debate during this election has been over a different standard applying to the Clintons.\u00a0 FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision Tuesday didn\u2019t treat Hillary differently from other high public officials, but he clearly treated her differently from other Americans. But politicians aren\u2019t unique. CEOs of major companies or public figures in other areas also face loss of careers simply by being charged. Possibly, prosecutors are simply more sensitive to politicians because they work for them. Politicians also have a lot of political connections. If Comey is to be faulted, it must be because he didn\u2019t explain these differences in his statement on Tuesday. When he said, \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\u201d he should have made it clear that they wouldn\u2019t have done so against a high public official. Comey reported that Clinton and her staff \u201cwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d He made three things clear: That the more protected private servers of others that Clinton was emailing with were hacked; \u201cthat Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent\u201d; and that she was \u201csending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.\u201d\u00a0 Despite Clinton\u2019s repeated denials, she sent and received emails that contained classified information at the time those emails were sent. Looking for definitive evidence of \u201cclearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information\u201d is an almost impossible standard to meet. It's something that most Americans who are not deeply involved in the legal system wouldn\u2019t realize is happening. It is also clearly not the law. People can read for themselves the criminal code (18 USC 793 Section f).\u00a0 \u201cGross negligence\u201d of mishandling classified information is enough. In Comey\u2019s own words, Hillary clearly met that standard.\u00a0 There is no requirement for intent or willfulness. Hillary may not have been treated differently than other high public officials, but when has such a high level public official ever previously faced such \u201cgross negligence\u201d in handling America\u2019s most important security secrets? Answer: Never.",

            "article_content": "Officer William Porter charged with manslaughter for Gray's death BALTIMORE \u2013 Jury selection for the first police officer to go to trial in Freddie Gray' s death began Monday with a judge questioning potential jurors about their knowledge of the explosive case, which led to widespread protests and rioting and added fuel to the Black Lives Matter movement. Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams conducted initial questioning in a courtroom but planned to interview at least 66 prospective jurors in a private conference room. The large pool of people suggested how difficult the selection process could be. William Porter is one of six officers charged in the death of Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died April 19 of a severe spinal injury he suffered while in police custody. Porter, who is also black, is accused of failing to get medical help for Gray during several stops made by the police van that carried Gray on a 45-minute trip. At the end, officers found Gray unresponsive. He was taken to a hospital and died a week later. The officer is being tried first in part because prosecutors want to use him as a witness in the trials of several other officers. He is charged with manslaughter, assault, misconduct and reckless endangerment. The judge asked 75 potential jurors whether anyone had not heard about the case, the citywide curfew imposed after Gray's death or the settlement paid to his family. No one responded. By standing in response to the judge's questions, 12 jurors indicated they had family members in law enforcement. Thirty-eight indicated they had been a victim or a suspect in a crime, had been to jail or had charges pending against them. Twenty-six people indicated they had strong feelings about the charges against Porter. Williams read aloud more than 200 names of possible witnesses, a list that included more than 100 Baltimore police officers, lawyers and prosecutors. A small group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse. Their chants of \"All night, all day, we will fight for Freddie Gray,\" could be heard throughout the morning proceedings. One prospective juror was taken to a hospital after tripping on courthouse stairs. Court spokeswoman Terri Charles said the woman suffered a knee injury. A verdict is likely to set the tone for the city. If Porter is acquitted, there could be protests and possibly more unrest. A conviction could send shock waves through the city's troubled police department. \"Everything is at stake. The future of the city is at stake,\" Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has said. The first group of 75 possible jurors was sent home Monday night and court spokeswoman Terri Charles said that some would be notified before Wednesday that they had been dismissed. A new panel of about 75 potential jurors will be called into court Tuesday. The judge said he expects the trial to wrap up by Dec. 17. Two other officers are black and the three additional officers are white. They will be tried separately beginning in January. Their trials are expected to last until the spring. Gray was initially handcuffed. Later during his van ride, his legs were shackled and he was not put in a seat belt, a violation of department policy, prosecutors have said. Porter told police investigators that arresting Gray \"was always a big scene,\" according to a pretrial filing by defense attorneys. Porter indicated that he knew of a previous arrest in which Gray allegedly tried to kick out the windows of a police vehicle. \"You know, so he was always, always, like, banging around,\" Porter said in the statement excerpted in the filing. \"It was always a big scene whenever you attempted to arrest Freddie Gray.\" Defense attorneys say that helps explain Porter's actions during Gray's arrest. For several days after Gray died, the demonstrations were mostly peaceful. But on the day he was buried, looting and rioting started, and businesses were burned down. The unrest resulted in millions of dollars in property damage. The turmoil forced an incumbent mayor to drop out of a re-election campaign and toppled the career of a reform-minded police chief who was unceremoniously fired. The homicide rate soared, and the blood continues to spill on Baltimore's streets at a pace unseen in decades. Davis stepped in as police chief in July amid a crime spike that saw 45 homicides in a single month \u2014 a 43-year high. An independent review of the police response to the rioting revealed \"major shortcomings,\" and painted a portrait of an overwhelmed and under-prepared department. Hours before Police Commissioner Anthony Batts was fired in July, the police union issued its own scathing report. Its president called for Batts to \"step up.\" The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a probe into the department stemming from allegations that officers hassled people and used excessive force. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday that Maryland has been preparing for any disturbances related to the trials ever since he called in the National Guard to help restore order in April. He said his administration's security team has been meeting on an almost weekly basis.",

Ezekiel Emanuel, the leading architect of ObamaCare insisted on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d that Obama isn\u2019t to blame for millions of cancelled policies, premium spikes and other disruptions. \u201cThe insurance decides how to make money. When the private companies decide to drop an individual, you blame Obama. He isn\u2019t responsible for that,\u201d said Emanuel, brother to former White House Chief of Staff turned Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. [WaPo details the sticker shock many are feeling under ObamaCare as premiums far exceed those promised.] Promises, promises - White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer claimed Sunday that the millions of lost insurance policies under ObamaCare was the result of a prioritization of promises. President Obama, Pfeiffer said, meant to keep his promise to allow Americans to keep their policies, but that a more important promise got in the way. \u201c[I]f the president were to allow people to have those plans be downgraded, or insurance companies to keep selling barebones plans \u2026if he had done that he'd be violating even more important promise to the American people, that everyone would have a guarantee to access of quality affordable health insurance,\u201d Pfeiffer told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Pfeiffer did not say when Obama deemed the \u201cif you like it\u201d pledge inoperable due to the \u201cbarebones\u201d promise. More cancellations ahead - Once ObamaCare is fully implemented nearly 68 percent of private insurance holders are expected to lose coverage. A study finds nearly 129 million Americans will not be able to hold on to their current policies, Daily Caller reports.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle took to the Sunday shows calling for the president to take the failed Web site offline until the problems are fixed. Sen.

Pinckney's open coffin was being put on display under the dome where he served the state for nearly 20 years. Pinckney was one of those killed in a mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. (AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt) (The Associated Press) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2013 The site of a massacre a week ago, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is being reclaimed by parishioners who are pledging to remember the loved ones they lost in a shooting rampage while carrying on the work of the beloved pastor who was slain beside them. Only hours before the body of state senator and pastor Clementa Pinckney was to be returned to the historic black church one last time for his wake, members of his flock and non-church members alike packed into the church's basement to attend Wednesday night Bible study. It was the very same thing that was taking place a week ago before Pinckney and eight parishioners were gunned down in what authorities are investigating as a hate crime. \"Because of our faith, we've shown up once more again to declare that Jesus lives and because he lives, we can face tomorrow,\" interim pastor Norvel Goff told a multiracial crowd that swayed, clapped and sang in the same room where the shooting occurred. Among the worshippers were several family members of one of the victims, Myra Thompson. \"It is a powerful testimony that they are able to come,\" Goff said of Thompson's relatives, who were applauded by others in the audience. The first funerals of some of those slain were to begin Thursday at nearby churches in North Charleston, with a viewing for Pinckney inside Emanuel on Thursday evening. President Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy at Pinckney's funeral Friday at a nearby college arena. In the church's basement Wednesday evening, there was little evidence of the violence that had taken place there just seven days before. Workers at the church puttied over bullet holes in the wall and removed other traces of the attack before inviting the public back in, church spokeswoman Maxine Smith said. Just before the Bible study began, volunteers brought in a large wooden cross covered with notes of sympathy from well-wishers. A table in front of a small pulpit overflowed with roses, lilies and other flowers and plants. Propped up in front of it was a poster bearing written expressions of sympathy for Pinckney and the eight slain parishioners. The 41-year-old minister on Wednesday became the first African-American since Reconstruction to rest in honor in South Carolina's Statehouse Rotunda. Pinckney served the people from the Statehouse for nearly 20 years, first as a page, then a state representative, and later a senator. Prior to a public viewing that authorities say drew 4,000 mourners, his widow and two young daughters met a horse-drawn carriage carrying his body. As mourners filed by his open casket, a makeshift drape over a huge second-floor window obscured the secessionist battle flag outside on the Statehouse grounds, emphasizing how quickly this symbol of Southern pride has fallen into official disrepute. In state after state, the Confederate symbols that were seemingly embraced by the suspect in the killings, have suddenly come under question. Dylann Storm Roof was captured a day after the shootings when a motorist spotted his Confederate license plate. Images on a website created in Roof's name months before the attacks show him posing with the Confederate flag and burning and desecrating the U.S. flag. He also poses at Confederate museums, former slave plantations and slave graves. Gov. Nikki Haley started the groundswell against Confederate icons Monday by successfully calling on South Carolina lawmakers to debate taking down the Confederate battle flag flying in front of the Statehouse. Then Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, also a conservative Republican, issued an executive order that brought down four secessionist flags Wednesday. He compared the banner to the universally shunned symbols of Nazi Germany, a stunning reversal in a region where the Confederacy was formed 154 years ago and where Jefferson Davis was elected president. The iconic Confederate battle flag in particular \"is offensive to some people because unfortunately, it's like the swastika; some people have adopted that as part of their hate-filled groups,\" Bentley said. Both of Mississippi's U.S. senators have endorsed removing the Confederate symbol from the flag the state has flown since Reconstruction \u2014 despite a 2001 endorsement of the symbol by state voters. Other lawmakers and activists took aim at symbols including a bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest in Tennessee's Senate, a sculpture of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in the Kentucky Rotunda, the vanity license plates used by thousands of motorists, and Minnesota's Lake Calhoun. Businesses also have acted swiftly. Wal-Mart, e-Bay, Amazon, Target and Sears are among those saying Confederate merchandise will be gone from their stores and online sites. And Warner Bros. announced it will no longer license toy cars and models of the \"General Lee\" car with the Confederate flag on its roof that starred in the 1980s TV show \"Dukes of Hazzard.\" Ben Jones, the actor who played Cooter on the TV series, said these symbols are under attack by a \"wave of political correctness\" that is vilifying Southern culture. He said Confederate items will never be removed from the Cooter's Place stores he owns in Tennessee and Virginia. Republican Jonathon Hill, a freshman South Carolina representative, also said the flag should remain above the monument to fallen Confederate soldiers, and that addressing it now disrespects the victims' families. \"Dylann Roof wanted a race war, and I think this has a potential to start one in the sense that it's a very divisive issue,\" Hill said. A growing number of Confederate symbols have been defaced by graffiti. The words \"Black Lives Matter\" were spray-painted Wednesday on a century-old Confederate memorial in St. Louis, not far from Ferguson, Missouri, where the phrase took root after a white officer killed an unarmed black man last August. In Charleston, the words \"racist\" and \"slavery\" were painted Tuesday on a monument to Calhoun, just a block from where the Emanuel AME church stands on Calhoun Street. Goff used his time at Emanuel's Bible study to call for continued calm in Charleston in the face of the tragedy. \"We may not be in control of those who commit evil acts, but we are in control of how we respond to it,\" he said. ___ Jonathan Drew and Meg Kinnard in Charleston; Seanna Adcox, Jeffrey Collins, Susanne M.

            "article_content": "FILE - In this Monday, Aug. 29, 2016, file photo, Gov. Chris Christie listens to a question from the media in Trenton, N.J. (AP) NEWARK, N.J. \u2013 Three years after gridlock paralyzed a New Jersey town next to the busy George Washington Bridge for four days, a federal jury will begin considering whether it was a criminal conspiracy cooked up by two former allies of Republican Gov. Chris Christie for political revenge. Opening statements are set for Monday in the trial of Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly. Baroni was a top Christie appointee to the agency that operates the bridge, and Kelly was Christie's deputy chief of staff. Christie wasn't charged in the federal investigation, and a New Jersey state legislative probe also concluded he didn't know about the alleged scheme. But the trial is expected to produce new revelations on who in Christie's inner circle may have known about the plans or subsequent cover-up. Christie, an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, conceded last week the bridge scandal was a factor in GOP nominee Donald Trump's not picking him as a running mate. According to a federal indictment, Kelly and Baroni conspired to reduce access lanes to the bridge in Fort Lee, across the Hudson River from New York City, in September 2013 after the town's Democratic mayor declined to endorse Christie's re-election. About 150,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day, making it one of the world's busiest. They face counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, deprivation of civil rights and misusing an organization receiving federal funds. The organization is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs area bridges, tunnels and transit hubs and is where Baroni served as deputy executive director. The most serious charge in the indictment, wire fraud conspiracy, carries a maximum 20-year prison term. Prosecutors are expected to introduce texts and emails showing the defendants allegedly joking about the traffic jams even as Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich \u2014 who hadn't been notified ahead of time about the closures \u2014 called and sent emails seeking help. They'll also show jurors an email from Kelly to another Port Authority official a month before the traffic jams saying, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" That official, David Wildstein, pleaded guilty in 2015 and will be the government's key witness. Wildstein is a one-time political blogger and high school classmate of Christie's who served as the Port Authority's director of interstate capital projects, a position created for him. Kelly and Baroni have said in court filings that the government has twisted federal law to turn their actions into crimes. They also have said other people with more power and influence were involved but aren't being prosecuted.",

Predictably, Gray lost his bid for re-election. But now, with Wednesday's announcement that federal prosecutors decided not to charge Gray with a crime after investigating his 2010 campaign, he appears poised to return to politics.\u00a0 \u00a0Gray, 73, is pondering a bid for the D.C. Council. He could run in his home ward east of the Anacostia River, where he still has a strong support base. Despite the allegations, voters in his home ward picked him over current Mayor Muriel Bowser by more than 2-to-1 last year. He could also test whether voters citywide feel he's been vindicated by trying for an at-large council seat. Six people who worked on Gray's 2010 campaign pleaded guilty to felonies as prosecutors tried to build their case during an investigation that spanned nearly five years. The most serious revelations involved a $660,000 slush fund that an influential businessman used to boost Gray's get-out-the-vote efforts. Gray has repeatedly apologized for his aides' actions, but he has maintained he never broke any laws and had no idea that anybody else was, either. The U.S. Attorney's office formally ended the investigation Wednesday, announcing that there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone else. Historically, District of Columbia voters have forgiven much higher-profile transgressions. Marion Barry returned to the council less than a year after he was released from prison on a drug charge. Two years later, he was elected to a fourth term as mayor. \"If Vince decides to run again, voters can once again judge him based on his record of service,\" said Chuck Thies, who managed Gray's 2014 campaign. \"The innuendo and smear campaign led by federal prosecutors has been discredited.\" Democratic D.C. Council member Mary Cheh was a firsthand observer of Gray's rise and fall. She endorsed him over Adrian Fenty in 2010 despite Fenty's popularity in her wealthy, majority-white ward. Then she watched in horror as Gray's administration was derailed by revelations of lawless behavior by his campaign aides. Cheh called on Gray to resign, saying city voters deserved a \"do-over.\" But now, she thinks he'd be a welcome addition to the council, the city's 13-member legislature where he served for six years before becoming mayor, including four years as chairman. \"He was an excellent chair of the council, an excellent member of the council,\" Cheh said, adding that aside from the questions about how he took office, \"he was actually quite a good mayor. If he returns to office in some fashion or another, I think the District will benefit.\" As mayor, Gray, was a detail-oriented technocrat who earned praise for his management of city finances. The city enjoyed low crime, an increasing population and a booming real estate market during his tenure, and Gray maintained the key school reform measures launched under Fenty. However, the succession of Gray campaign aides who pleaded guilty, along with criminal convictions against three council members for unrelated crimes fueled perceptions that the local government was hopelessly corrupt even as the city thrived. Bowser campaigned on the idea of a \"fresh start\" for the city, and Gray is a potential antagonist for her. He declined to endorse her after she defeated him in the primary, and the two are not on speaking terms. However, their differences are rooted more in personality than politics: Both are mainstream Democrats with liberal views on social issues and ties to the business community. Bowser's supporters believe she would have defeated Gray even without the revelations from the U.S. Attorney's office, pointing to her 10-percentage-point margin of victory and her support across broad swaths of the city. Gray kept a relatively low profile after he left office on Jan. 1. He hasn't found a full-time job. His attorney, Robert Bennett, and others close to Gray said he had difficulty moving on with his life with the investigation looming over him. Gray issued a statement Wednesday that hinted at a return to politics. Through his attorney and Thies, he declined to comment further. \"Here in the District and around the country many people have had their faith in our justice system tested,\" Gray said. \"Justice delayed is justice denied, but I cannot change history. I look forward to getting on with the next chapter of my life, which will no doubt be dedicated to service.\"",

            "article_content": "Juan Williams and Mercedes Schlapp break down revelations in newly disclosed emails Newly disclosed emails show top Obama administration officials were in close contact with Hillary Clinton\u2019s nascent presidential campaign in early 2015 about the potential fallout from revelations that the former secretary of state used a private email server. Their discussion included a request from the White House communications director to her counterpart at the State Department to see if it was possible to arrange for Secretary of State John Kerry to avoid questions during media appearances about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email arrangement. In another instance, a top State Department official assured an attorney for Mrs. Clinton that, contrary to media reports, a department official hadn\u2019t told Congress that Mrs. Clinton erred in using a private email account. The previously unreported emails were obtained by the Republican National Committee as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking records of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s time in office. The RNC provided to The Wall Street Journal only some of the emails, leaving it unclear what was in the remaining documents. The RNC said it released only emails relevant to the communication between the White House and State Department. Meredith McGehee, chief of policy, programs, and strategy at the nonpartisan advocacy group Issue One and an expert on ethics and campaign finance, said the email exchange would probably raise no legal concerns because federal law permits members of the White House staff to engage in some political activity. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email arrangement has dogged her campaign for months, with Republicans and other critics saying it shows a carelessness with government secrets and undermines her claim to good judgment. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign posted a statement on his website last month saying the Obama White House knew Mrs. Clinton was using a private email server. Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged the arrangement was a mistake, but she has rejected the notion that national secrets were placed at risk. Her campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the new email disclosures. The emails highlight the revolving door between the State Department, the White House and the Clinton campaign in early 2015 as Mrs. Clinton geared up to run for president.

            "article_content": "Jennifer Griffin reports on 'Special Report' A Democratic elector in Washington state said Friday that he would not cast his Electoral College vote for Hillary Clinton if, as is likely, she wins the state in Tuesday's election. Robert Satiacum, a member of the Puyallup Tribe, supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, which the Vermont senator won by approximately a 3-to-1 margin. He said he believes Clinton is a \"criminal\" who doesn't care enough about American Indians and \"she's done nothing but flip back and forth.\" He said he has wrestled with what to do, but feels that neither Clinton nor Republican Donald Trump can lead the country. \"She will not get my vote, period,\" he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. Satiacum said he believes Sanders did a better job of reaching out to Native Americans. \"She doesn't care about my land or my air or my fire or my water,\" he said of Clinton. Americans vote for the president on Election Day, but they're really casting votes for each state's electors, who will decide the next president on Dec. 19. In all but two states (Maine and Nebraska), the winner of the state's popular vote gets all of the state's electors. There's nothing in the Constitution that says the electors are required to vote for a particular candidate, but some states have penalties for so-called \"faithless electors.\" Satiacum faces a $1,000 fine in Washington if he doesn't vote for Clinton, but he said he doesn't care. \"I hope it comes down to a swing vote and it\u2019s me,\u201d he told The Seattle Times. \"Good. She ain\u2019t getting it. Maybe it\u2019ll wake this country up.\" Satiacum is one of 12 Democratic electors in Washington, which has 12 electoral votes and has not gone for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Satiacum said he has gotten a lot of criticism since he told media outlets last month that he might not vote for Clinton. But he said he has also heard from electors in other states who thanked him for speaking out. He said he hopes some of those electors follow his lead. At the time of of Satiacum's initial statements, the\u00a0Puyallup Tribal Council issued a statement saying that he had pledged to support the winner of the state's popular vote Nov. 8 and \"risks dishonoring himself\" if he does not do so. According to the National Archives, 99 percent of electors through U.S. history have voted for their party's candidate, and none of the dissenters has ever changed the result of an election. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Click for more from The Seattle Times.",

            "article_content": "Harvard Law professor goes on 'The Kelly File' to react to the latest hearing on Hillary's server; discuss new book This is the strangest presidential election in my memory. Despite the polls, the outcome is utterly unpredictable. This was true even before Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent health issue. Just consider this: it was only a month ago that the Washington Post declared a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, \u201c[A] dispassionate examination of the data, combined with a coldblooded look at the candidates, the campaigns and presidential elections, produces only one possible conclusion: Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump in November\u2026 Three months from now, with the 2016 presidential election in the rearview mirror, we will look back and agree that the presidential election was over on Aug. 9th.\u201d On August 24, Slate \u2013 a liberal online magazine owned by the Washington Post similarly declared, \u201cThere is no horse race: it\u2019s Clinton by a mile, with Trump praying for black swans\u201d -- only to \u201cpredict\u201d one week later \u201cTrump-Clinton Probably Won\u2019t be A Landslide.\u201d A few days ago, in a desperate attempt to analyze the new polls showing Trump closing in on Clinton, Slate explained sheepishly \u201cThings realistically couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse for Trump than they were a few weeks ago, and so it\u2019s not a shock that they instead have gotten a little better of late.\u201d Some current polls even show Trump with a slight lead. The reality is that polling is incapable of accurately predicting the outcome of elections like this one, where so many voters are angry, resentful, emotional, negative, and frightened. In my new book, \u201cElectile Dysfunction: A Guide for the Unaroused Voter,\u201d I discuss in detail why so many voters now say they won\u2019t vote at all, or will vote for a third-party candidate. As the New York Times reported, \u201conly 9 percent of America chose Trump and Clinton as the Nominees.\u201d Or to put the voter\u2019s frustration with the candidates more starkly, \u201c81\u00a0percent of Americans say they would feel afraid following the election of one of the two politicians.\u201d Despite their perceived lack of agency, these voters may, of course, end up voting for one of the two major candidates when Election Day comes around. This may depend in part on whether the Johnson-Weld ticket does well enough in the polls to be included in the presidential and vice presidential debates. The rules require that a third-party candidate reach 15\u00a0percent in five national polls. This number is difficult to achieve because many of the polls do not include third-party candidates. But it is not impossible, and if it were to occur, and if the Johnson-Weld ticket outperformed or held its own against Clinton and Trump, then people who had decided not to vote or who couldn\u2019t make up their minds might cast ballots for the Libertarian candidates. It is unlikely that the Stein/Baraka ticket will be included in the debates or that it will garner any significant number of voters in key states because the candidates are so extreme in their views and so out of the mainstream of American political beliefs. However, if a significant number of voters do vote for a third or fourth party, this could impact the election, as the votes for Ralph Nader in 2000 may have determined the Florida outcome, which in turn determined the general election outcome. The bottom line is that in a bizarre election like this one\u2014with so many variables and so much emotion\u2014polls may well under -- or over -- predict votes for the two major candidates. Think about the vote on Brexit. Virtually all the polls\u2014including exit polls that asked voters whom they had voted for\u2014got it wrong. The financial markets got it wrong. The bookies got it wrong. The 2016 presidential election is more like the Brexit vote in many ways than it is like prior presidential elections. Both Brexit and this presidential election involve raw emotion, populism, anger, nationalism, class division, and other factors that distort accuracy in polling. Anyone who thinks they know who will be the next president of the United States is deceiving themselves! To be sure, the Electoral College vote is sometimes less difficult to predict than the popular vote, because it generally turns on a handful of closely contested critical states, such as Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. But in this election, there could be surprises in states that are usually secure for one party or the other. So even the electoral vote will be more difficult to predict than in previous elections. One reason for this unique unpredictability is the unique unpredictability of Donald Trump himself. No one really knows what he will say or do between now and the election. His position on important issues may change. Live televised debates will not allow him to rely on a TelePrompter, as he largely did in his acceptance speech or in his speech during his visit to Mexico City. He may once again become a loose cannon.\u00a0 No one can predict what he will say or do next. This may gain him votes, or it may lose him votes. Just remember: few, if any, pundits accurately predicted how far Trump would get when he first entered the race. When it comes to Donald Trump, the science of polling seems inadequate to the task. Hillary Clinton is more predictable, but her past actions may produce unpredictable results, as they did when FBI director Comey characterized her conduct with regard to her emails as \u201cextremely careless.\u201d It is also possible that more damaging information about her private email server or the Clinton Foundation may come from WikiLeaks or other such sources (whether these \u201crevelations\u201d are actually incriminating seems to be beside the point for those 54 percent of voters who, without first-hand knowledge of the investigation, suspect that the FBI engaged in a preferential treatment by not seeking criminal charges against Clinton.) Finally, it is difficult to assess what impact, if any, her recent health issues may have on voters. Another unpredictable factor that may impact the election is whether there are terrorist attacks in the lead-up to the voting. Islamic extremists would almost certainly like to see Trump beat Clinton, because they believe a Trump presidency would result in the kind of instability on which they thrive. If ISIS attacks American targets in late October, that could turn some undecided voters in favor of the candidate who says he will do anything to stop terrorism. If voters were to change their votes based on terrorist acts, that would only encourage more terrorism in the run-up to elections. A final reason why this election is so unpredictable is because the voter turnout is unpredictable. The \u201cBernie or bust\u201d crowd is threatening to stay home or vote for the Green Party. Young voters may do here what they did in Great Britain: many failed to vote in the Brexit referendum and then regretted their inaction when it became clear that if they had voted in the same proportion as older voters, Brexit would likely have been defeated. Some Clinton supporters worry that black voters who voted in large numbers for Barack Obama may cast fewer votes for Clinton in this election. Voters who usually vote Republican but can\u2019t bring themselves to pull the lever for Trump may decide to stay home. Turnout is unpredictable, and the effect of low voter turnout is also unpredictable. So, for all these reasons and others, no one can tell how this election will turn out. It would be a real tragedy and an insult to democracy if the election were to be decided by those who fail to vote, rather than by those who come out to vote for or against one of the two major candidates.",

            "article_content": "President campaigns for the first time with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in Charlotte, North Carolina President Obama made his debut appearance on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton Tuesday in swing state North Carolina -- touting the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s decades of political experience and her potential to help working-class Americans and \u201cmake us proud around the world.\" \u201cThe fact is, Hillary Clinton is steady and true,\u201d Obama told the crowd inside the Charlotte Convention Center. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been in politics for the same reason I have: to make peoples\u2019 lives better. \u2026 I\u2019m ready to pass the baton, and I know Hillary Clinton can take it.\u201d Clinton and Obama appeared together just hours after FBI Director James Comey said Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her use of a private email server while secretary of state but that the agency would not recommend criminal charges in the case. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly criticized the recommendation, which Attorney General Loretta Lynch is expected to accept. \u201cComey let Clinton off the hook,\u201d Trump said in one of two statements. \u201cThe fix was final. The Obama administration's anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her path and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination.\u201d Clinton, who spoke in North Carolina from behind a lectern with the official presidential seal, didn\u2019t mention the server case, which has hung over her campaign. She instead touted a plan for middle-class prosperity that included increasing the federal minimum wage, debt-fee college and an economy in which \u201cWall Street and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes.\u201d \u201cWe need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d said the former first lady and U.S. senator from New York, vowing if elected the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since WWII. \u201cIt\u2019s just plain wrong that a millionaire can pay as much taxes as his secretary,\u201d she added. Obama won North Carolina when elected president in 2008 but narrowly lost the state in 2012 to GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Clinton leads Trump in North Carolina by less than 1 percentage point, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. Obama and Clinton were scheduled to make their first joint appearance of the 2016 campaign last month in swing state Wisconsin but canceled in the aftermath of the mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub. The Obama-Clinton stop marked a new chapter in their political relationship, which started when they were senators, then evolved as rivals in the 2008 Democratic primary and Clinton then becoming Obama\u2019s secretary of state in 2009. \u201cWe may have gone toe-to-toe, but we stood shoulder-to-shoulder on our values,\u201d Obama said about the race. \u201cFor as much as I admired her in the Senate, I came away from the primary admiring her even more. \u2026 I believe in Hillary Clinton. And I want you to help make her the next president of the United States.\u201d Clinton and Obama traveled to the North Carolina event together on Air Force One, to which Trump objected. \"Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary?\" the first-time candidate tweeted this past weekend. \"Who pays?\" Presidents always fly on Air Force One, no matter the purpose of the trip. Political committees are required to contribute to the cost of a president's campaign-related travel, though a portion of such costs is borne by taxpayers, too. \"As is the standard practice, the campaign will cover its portion of the costs,\" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said. Clinton aides said they're confident they could deploy Obama in any of the roughly eight battleground states, though they think he'll be particularly effective in rallying young people, as well as black and Hispanic voters, and will be instrumental in voter registration efforts. Still, the president issued several shots at Trump, saying, \u201cIf your concern is working\u2013class people, this is not your choice.\u201d However, Obama won't spend the next four months as the \"Trump-troller in chief,\" as one official put it. Obama\u2019s narrow North\u00a0Carolina victory in 2008 made him the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since 1976. His campaign aggressively registered more young people and black voters, and he drew support from moderates in the booming suburbs of Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham. The president was eager to cement Democrats' strength in North\u00a0Carolina during his re-election campaign, even holding the party\u2019s convention in Charlotte. But he was dogged by a sluggish economy and disappointment among some swing voters. The White House race in North Carolina could also have a more far-reaching impact on Washington. Sen. Richard Burr, one of just a few Washington Republicans to endorse Trump, is in a tough re-election bid against former state Democratic lawmaker Deborah Ross. Washington Democrats have increasingly targeted him for defeat, and a GOP loss would be key in Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake the Senate. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President speaks at opening ceremony of National Museum of African American History and Culture America's first national museum dedicated to African-American history and culture opened Saturday with emotional but joyful words from the country's first black president, Barack Obama, who said he hoped the stories contained inside will help everyone \"walk away that much more in love\" with their country. In an impassioned speech, Obama\u00a0pointed out the highs and lows of being black in America, from slavery and Jim Crow segregation to voting rights and economic leaders. That duality lingers still,\u00a0Obama said, through successes such as his presidency, and trials such as the police killings of black men. \"We are not a burden on America. Or a stain on America ... we are America. And that's what this museum explains,\"\u00a0Obama\u00a0said. He and first lady Michelle\u00a0Obama\u00a0joined Ruth Bonner, a 99-year-old direct descendent of a slave, and her family as they rang a bell from the historic First Baptist Church of Williamsburg, Virginia, to signal that the museum was officially open. The church, believed to be among the first Baptist churches organized entirely by black people, acquired its Freedom Bell in 1886. It will return to the church for its 240th anniversary later this year. Civil rights veteran John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia who co-sponsored the bill that created the museum, said he hopes visitors will come away with a healthy respect for human dignity, \"and a stronger commitment to the idea of justice, truth and democracy.\" \"This place is more than a building, it is a dream come true,\" Lewis said. In his speech,\u00a0Obama\u00a0imagined himself coming back to the museum someday as a private citizen, \"holding a little hand of somebody and telling them the stories enshrined here.\" A shining bronze-colored beacon on the National Mall, only steps away from the White House and the Washington Monument, the new Smithsonian chronicles the complex relationship between the United States and a people it once enslaved and tells the story of those who worked at the changes necessary to bring the country to where it is today. Thousands gathered on the National Mall to watch the museum officially open its doors and to be among the first inside \u2014 if they were lucky enough to get the much-coveted opening day tickets. \"It's like walking across the desert and finally getting to a fountain of water to quench your thirst. It's absolutely breathtaking for me,\" said Verna Eggleston, 61, of New York City, who was touring the museum later Saturday. After a decades-long push, ground was broken for the new museum in 2012 on a five-acre tract near the Washington Monument. Lewis worked with then-Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, now the state's Republican governor, to usher legislation through Congress. President George W. Bush signed it into law in 2003. Bush said the museum tells the unvarnished truth, that a country founded on the promise of liberty once held millions of people in chains. A great nation does not hide from its history, Bush said, \"it faces its flaws and corrects them.\" Construction was completed earlier this year on the 400,000-square-foot museum designed by British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye. The museum strikes a unique shape on the Mall with its three-tiered bronze exterior panels inspired by an African wooden column. The bronze-colored tiles are inspired by 19th century ironwork created by slaves in the South, and allow sunlight into the museum through its patterns. The new museum \"symbolizes all of the contributions, the culture and the crisis of black America,\" said Rev. Howard-John Wesley, pastor of Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, whose members donated $1 million to the museum. \"It's a beautiful thing, especially in this day and time when we're fighting to remind ourselves how important black lives are.\" Inside, museum officials say they have nearly 3,000 items occupying 85,000 square feet of display space, including exhibits like a Tuskegee Airmen training plane and the casket of Emmitt Till, an African-American boy whose murder helped rally the civil rights movement. \"It's been 100 years in the making. So many people have dreamed about this, fought for this and wanted this to happen,\" said U.S. Circuit Judge Robert L. Wilkins, who wrote \"Long Road to Hard Truth,\" a book about the struggle open the museum. \"It's going to be a testament to their work and a testament to so many of our ancestors that this museum will open on the Mall.\" Millions of donors, known and unknown, contributed to the $315 million in private funding raised before the museum's opening. Some of the biggest donors' names adorn the walls inside, including the Oprah Winfrey Theater; the Michael Jordan Hall: Game Changers; and the Robert F. Smith Explore Your Family History Center, named for the CEO of investment firm Vista Equity Partners after a $20 million gift announced Monday. As part of the opening ceremony, Winfrey and actor Will Smith read lines of famous black writers, from Maya Angelou to Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison and Martin Luther King Jr. \"I am overwhelmed. I'm humbled,\" said Deborah Elam, president of the GE Foundation and chief diversity officer for General Electric, as she waited Saturday among the dignitaries on the National Mall. GE donated $5 million toward the museum's construction. Some people trying to get to the dedication ceremony stood for more than an hour in lines that snaked around the Mall to get through security. Master Sgt. Donald Sparks of Houston, who just finished a yearlong deployment in Iraq, said he was eager to see the exhibits inside the museum. \"I'm just elated and can't express how much joy and gratitude I have to be here today and witness history,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "With all due respect to those Democrats in the nation\u2019s capital holding a presidential primary next Tuesday, the jury\u2019s already rendered its verdict. Donald Trump will be the Republicans\u2019 nominee \u2013 the first nonpolitician to earn that distinction since Dwight Eisenhower back in 1952. Hillary Clinton will do the honors for the Democrats \u2013 the first woman to lead a major party into a general election. As the dust settles on what\u2019s been an adventurous past twelve months (my timeline starts with Trump\u2019s campaign kickoff remarks on June 16 of last year), here are five surprises in this unorthodox election year. 1. No Love For Guvs. Reams of paper and a sea of terabytes and petabytes (plus a small ocean of distilled spirits) will be devoted to the art and science of explaining the political phenomenon that is Trump. So let\u2019s focus elsewhere. Once upon a time, there were 17 Republican presidential candidates \u2013 nine of them past or present governors. It didn\u2019t take long for the herd to thin. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the early darling of the Republican big-money crowd, didn\u2019t advance past South Carolina. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a favorite of the chattering class given his folksy appeal and history of winning contentious elections, didn\u2019t even make it to Iowa. Nor did former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the first of the 16 GOP fatalities. In the end, not a single Republicans governor came close to denying Trump the nomination \u2013 yes, that includes Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the last big-name state executive standing. It's the first time in 20 years that a GOP governor won\u2019t head into the national convention either leading or second in delegates amassed. The significance? The 31 Republican governors nationwide are the GOP\u2019s security blanket \u2013 its best hope for rehabilitating the party\u2019s brand. Should Republican primary voters continue to reject every presidential hopeful whose message begins with: \u201cAs we\u2019ve proven in my state . . .\u201d? If so, the GOP will have to look elsewhere for new leaders. 2. A Familiar March and April. The Republicans\u2019 surprise ending notwithstanding, the early GOP primaries and caucuses served their purpose: Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina whittled the field to a more manageable number. Of the 12 Republican candidates with active campaigns going into the calendar year, seven didn\u2019t make it past February. Two more contenders \u2013 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2013 didn\u2019t make it past the second Tuesday in March. The funny thing: for Republicans, 2016 played out a lot like 2012. Four years ago, Mitt Romney won big in the early-March \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d (7 of 10 states, 223 delegates to only 112 for his closest rival). But it wasn\u2019t until the end of April, after Romney had swept all eight of the month\u2019s primaries, that the Republican National Committee declared a presumptive nominee. And 2016? Trump received 255 delegates \u2013 37 more than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 in the first of the two \u201cSuper Tuesdays\u201d. The second time around, Trump steamrolled Cruz, 228-51. After losing Wisconsin\u2019s April 5 primary, Trump swept the month\u2019s remaining contests. The RNC\u2019s papal blessing: it came on May 3, only eight days later than Romney\u2019s four years before. 3. Fool Me Once, Fool Me Twice. Two millennia before anyone first uttered \u201ctriangulation\u201d, there was a pragmatist by the name Aristotle who thus observed: \u201cYouth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope\u201d. 2008\u2019s deception: Barack Obama convincing Generation Y to side with him rather than Hillary Clinton, then failing to deliver on a laundry list of progressive promises (including that over-the-top rhetoric about slowing the rising oceans and healing the planet). Fooled once, how did Gen Y react? By falling even harder for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He received over 70% of the under-30 in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries versus only 60% for Obama. And he\u00a0earned more youth votes than Clinton and Trump combined. This, despite such Danish socialist pie-in-the-sky concepts like single-payer heath care, monster tax hikes and free college tuition that will never see the light of day in Congress. Once all the Democratic votes are counted, a quarter of Sanders\u2019 support will have come from young voters, as compared to only 10% for Clinton. The significance: America\u2019s millennial generation is now 80-million strong. It\u2019s the largest age group in over a century. Clinton needs the voting bloc on board and en masse if she\u2019s to defeat Trump. By the way, the youth vote isn\u2019t just an American enigma. Across the pond, the 18-29 turnout may decide the fate of this month\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. Down under, Australian election officials ponder what to do with the one-quarter of that nation\u2019s 18-to-24-year-olds who haven\u2019t bothered to enroll to vote. 4. 59 Flavors Of Unconventional. This wasn\u2019t the first time that America was graced by presidential candidates who were, to be polite about it, unorthodox. In 1992, Ross Perot garnered nearly 19% of the national vote despite coming across as the daft uncle you\u2019re glad visits only once a year. In both that and the subsequent presidential contest, Pat Buchanan tormented the GOP establishment as, basically, a parochial-school bully shoving around a field of timid WASPs. In 2016, Trump and Sanders took the concept of unconventional to new heights. They challenged their parties\u2019 power structures, they wagered on free media and perceived momentum trumping nut-and-bolts organizing. At all times, they turned common sense on its head (no way an avowed socialist should fare well in a capitalist economy; an anti-immigrant message should stand little chance in a nation that embodies the immigrant dream). In the end, Trump and Sanders combined won 59 primaries and caucuses (36 for The Donald, 23 for Bernie) \u2013 about 57 more than most expected, other than New Hampshire and Vermont. Not too shabby. 5. Party Down \u2013 Both Parties, That Is. In an election in which control of both the White House and Congress are very much in doubt, which national party would you rather not be at this hour? A Republican presidential field that supposedly was the GOP\u2019s strongest in decades instead was largely defined by its inability to deny Trump the nomination, much less take him on in debates and daily discourse. Should Trump lose this\u00a0fall, it\u2019s the same\u00a0quandary for Republicans in 2020: outsiders, pragmatists and conservatives wrestling over the party\u2019s conscience. Not that the Democratic Party is any picnic. Consider Clinton\u2019s rivals for the nomination: a 74-year-old socialist with little to show despite a quarter of a century on Capitol Hill, plus three relative obscure former officeholders. For\u00a0Clinton,\u00a0surviving Sanders was more about perspiration than aspiration. How fragile is the Democratic existence? Should tragedy (or a criminal indictment) suddenly befall Clinton, the party elders mostly likely would turn to Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 a personable but gaffe-prone two-time presidential loser attempting the\u00a0rarity of a sitting vice\u00a0president trying to\u00a0ascend to the Oval Office. Collectively, it\u2019s two parties that are offering American arguably the most uncomfortable lot of nominees since 1968 and the choices of Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon and George Wallace\u00a0\u2014 coincidentally, the first presidential election in which Donald Trump and Hillary\u00a0Clinton were eligible to vote. All the more reason why they should appreciate the nation\u2019s quandary.",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from \"Angry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America\u2014and What We Can All Do to Save the Middle Class\" (Skyhorse Publishing, August 23, 2016) Ultra-liberal Democrats and the mainstream media (I know, I repeat myself) cannot understand why white voters, particularly white men, are so angry. Well, I\u2019m going to share with you the raw, politically incorrect truth. It\u2019s an indictment of a president and system practicing reverse racism and overt discrimination\u2014in plain sight for all to see. First, there is no doubt that blacks, minorities, and people of color had it rough for many decades. Women, especially in the workplace, had the system tilted against them. We get it. And during the past hundred years, especially the last sixty, the vast majority of us fought hard to eliminate it. No one can deny the terrible things done to blacks: slavery; discrimination in jobs and housing; poll taxes; and \u201cWhites Only\u201d signs in front of bathrooms, pools, water fountains, and restaurant counters. The list of wrongs and grievances is long and real. But that was then, and this is now. And two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. The sorry truth is that the pendulum has swung way too far in the other direction. It has gotten to a point where virtually every action, law, and utterance out of our nation\u2019s first black president\u2019s mouth is intended to denigrate or damage the predominantly white middle class. Or haven\u2019t you noticed? Let me start with the obvious. Suicide Studies and polls show blacks and people of color are relatively happy and unchanged in their satisfaction level for decades. Yet under Obama, America is in the middle of a massive suicide epidemic. Who is committing all this suicide? White middle-aged Americans.1 In other words, the white middle class and \u201cangry white males\u201d are so unhappy they are killing themselves. We should be worried about \u201cWhite Lives Matter.\u201d But, of course, then we would be called \u201cracist.\u201d Is the liberal view it\u2019s \u201call in our heads\u201d? Or could some- thing actually be wrong? Do liberals think an entire race has suffered a dramatic increase in depression and suicide because life is so easy and great for white people? Because we have such fantastic advantages? Because great jobs, perfect relationships, and wealth just appear out of thin air or fall out of trees for white people? Or could this depression, anger, and suicide be the result of no jobs or only menial, crappy, low-wage jobs; or a dramatic drop in our incomes and assets; or dramatic increases in taxes, health insurance, electric bills, grocery bills, and college bills\u2014 all of which has made it virtually impossible to provide for our families. The fact is that our own government is destroying the middle class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility. The predominantly white middle class has been sacrificed to give welfare and free health care to everyone else. And to add insult to injury, \u201ceveryone else\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean other, less fortunate fellow citizens who most of us want to help; it also means every illegal alien who can walk across the border, many of whom hate us and the whole concept of America. Result? We\u2019re killing ourselves. That might have something to do with it. In other words, for your typical middle-class American, life sucks. Under Obama and the political elites, the quality of middle-class life has been gutted, and the American Dream of upward mobility is dead. And who makes up this great American middle class? Predominantly white people. Ironically, the crux of the liberal argument is that white people have all the money, power, and high-paying jobs and own all the businesses. Yet when laws and policies are passed to redistribute their money to those who are poor and dependent, liberal politicians, intellectuals, and the media refuse to admit these policies are nothing more than reverse racism and discrimination. These policies are a sign of ignorance and stupidity, especially as to how an economy works. A study of every socialist country in world history shows that \u201cfairness, equality, and social justice\u201d leads to devastating widespread poverty and shared misery. Venezuela is the most recent example that big government tax-and-spend policies lead to economic collapse, food shortages, and no toilet paper. Hotels ask guests to BYOTP\u2014\u201cbring your own toilet paper.\u201d2 Gotta love big government, huh? It doesn\u2019t just kill spirit, or kill people, it even kills toilet paper! The only thing every country basing its economy on diversity, social justice, and affirmative action has succeeded in is making the powerful, political elites filthy rich and making everyone else poor. Liberal (i.e., socialist) policies lead to economic disaster. No one is lifted up, everyone is torn down, and the middle class, not the wealthy, are the ones who suffer. Sound like what is happening right now in America? Obama and his progressive crony elites in the media and Congress have spent almost eight years conducting a massive, radical experiment basing our economy on \u201cdiversity, equality, and social justice.\u201d The result? Obama has succeeded in destroying America\u2019s middle class, just like every other country that ever tried to legislate equality. And that middle class happens to be overwhelmingly white. Was it worth it? Did income redistribution\u2014that is, taking money and jobs away from small business and the overwhelmingly white middle class with massive taxes and regulations, onerous Obamacare, and climate change costs\u2014 and all the spending on entitlements and debt, actually benefit black Americans? You tell me. The fact is our first black president has overseen the greatest inequality in history: Black unemployment is now double that of white unemployment. Poverty is back to 1960s levels, while welfare, food stamps, and disability have hit all-time record highs. Black violence and murder rates in inner city urban areas are spiraling out of control. Predominantly black cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore are not only bankrupt, they\u2019re war zones. Violence on inner city streets has risen to unprecedented levels. Who are the victims? Black Americans. Obama has spent more, handed out more entitlements, more welfare, more food stamps, and now more debt than any president in history. Yet the economy is miserable and the only true measurement of economic growth\u2014gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014is near zero. Obama is the only president to ever preside over seven straight years of GDP under 3 percent. Not even Herbert Hoover or FDR in the depths of the Great Depression produced an economic record as miserable and pathetic as Obama. It\u2019s an economic record of futility, which, like Joe DiMaggio\u2019s fifty-six-game hitting streak, will never be matched! The result: 63 percent of Americans can\u2019t come up with $500 in case of an emergency.3 The wealth gap between white and black Americans is wider today than in the 1960s when the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d began.4 Amazingly, along with driving white and black Americans into bankruptcy and poverty, Obama will have added a world-record $10 trillion to the debt (by the time he leaves office). That\u2019s money that has to be paid back by the middle class for decades to come, thereby guaranteeing a shrinking middle class in crisis long after Obama is gone. And you wonder why we\u2019re angry? Obama\u2019s success in fundamentally changing America looks exactly like the situation in every communist, socialist, and third-world country\u2014inequality, massive poverty, shared misery, and no middle class. Thank you, Obama: you\u2019ve turned America into a third-world mess. Sadly, Obama had a golden opportunity to be a leader and make America a truly color-blind nation. I believe it is a major reason so many Americans voted for him and is what even those of us who didn\u2019t support him had great hope he would do. Instead, he\u2019s produced the worst race relations since the 1960s.5 Now, let\u2019s go a step deeper. Let\u2019s examine specific Obama policies that are clearly aimed right at the heart of white America. You wonder why white America is angry? Liberals can\u2019t understand why white America is outraged, shocked, and feels betrayed, denigrated, and discriminated? Here it is. Hiring Employees in the Private Sector How many Americans are aware that the Obama administration sued major corporations to ban them from using criminal background checks on black job applicants? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had the anti-white, outright racist audacity to argue that criminal background checks for whites are perfectly acceptable, but corporations should be banned from checking on the criminal records of blacks. Why? Because, they argued, black males are so likely to have a criminal record, they would never be hired. So business owners have no right to know the back- ground of the person they\u2019re hiring to handle money and deal with valued customers? According to Obama, drug dealers, pimps, and rapists should wait on your female customers. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Hiring of Government Employees Not content to strike out with his order in the private sector, President Obama signed an Executive Order in December of 2015 to \u201cban the box.\u201d6 This means federal agencies can no longer ask prospective job applicants about their criminal history. Amazingly, what this means is government employees paid with your taxpayer money (often at a higher rate than a similar job in the private sector) will now include convicted criminals. The government is using your taxes to pay convicted criminals to oversee your life. Wait, it gets better. Government employees at agencies like the IRS, the National Security Agency (NSA), and Social Security have access to highly confidential financial information that can be stolen and sold to thieves and frauds (or people looking to blackmail politicians into voting for bigger government). Doesn\u2019t it make sense that an applicant\u2019s criminal background should at least be considered? Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Housing Are you aware that the Obama administration has told land- lords they have no right to reject a potential tenant based on a criminal record? Property owners are now obligated by law to rent to known murderers, rapists, drug dealers, pimps, carjackers, and home-invasion robbers. The administration admitted that this law is to protect criminals because they hap- pen to be predominantly black. As always, Obama\u2019s Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department plays the race card by saying if you refuse to rent to criminals, you\u2019re \u201cracist\u201d because this disproportionately affects African Americans.7 Once again, this book isn\u2019t about race, but it is about reverse racism. I\u2019m merely responding in self-defense. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Neighborhoods How many Americans realize that Obama\u2019s HUD agency is forcing cities and towns across America to build high- density, low-income housing in middle class and wealthy white neighborhoods? Why? A liberal Mexican American activist at a famous economic event called FreedomFest aimed a question at Donald Trump that explains what we\u2019re facing. Clearly angry at Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall at the Mexican border, he asked Trump, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to build a wall around your inner cities to protect your citizens from American criminals?\u201d The factual answer to that question is we already have. It\u2019s called \u201csuburbs.\u201d America has experienced a \u201cwhite (and every other racial group with the economic ability) flight\u201d away from inner cities to suburbs for decades. It\u2019s why Detroit lost over half its population. Decent, law-abiding people of all races with good jobs tend to run away from crime\u2014especially once they start a family. But to Obama and his liberal friends, this isn\u2019t \u201cfair.\u201d People don\u2019t have a right to be mobile, send their kids to better schools, or avoid crime. Obama wants everyone to live in shared equality (i.e., misery). Now he\u2019s found a way to accomplish that. If he can\u2019t find a way to force you to live in poor, crime-ridden, inner city neighborhoods, he\u2019ll just create them in your neighborhood! As a bonus, this policy erodes personal responsibility and capitalism by eliminating the necessity to study hard, work hard, or be disciplined to move from a poor neighbor- hood to a nice middle-class one. But wait, it gets better; it\u2019s part of a socialist\u2019s wish list. This policy not only creates fairness and equality by putting poor people into wealthy neighborhoods without working for it; it also destroys the property values of middle-class, pre- dominantly white homeowners. In the short run, the poor may be lifted up; in the longer run, everyone else is brought down. For liberals, that\u2019s \u201cequality.\u201d Look at it from the point of view of a middle-class American. You\u2019ve worked long and hard so your kids can live in a safe neighborhood, only to see Obama force low-income housing on your block, drive your home value down, and infest your nice, safe neighborhood with crime, muggings, robberies, carjackings, drugs, and prostitution. Nice! Again, while Obama and liberals keep wanting to make this a racial issue, it\u2019s not. Like whites, black middle-class Americans have followed the same route. For the most part, middle-class blacks have left the inner cities. They move to suburbs to escape crime, filth, drugs, and poverty and to give their kids a chance at success. But Obama wants there to be no escape. He\u2019s bringing the devil to you. To your neighborhood, your block, perhaps next door. He\u2019s putting drug dealers on your corner. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Health Care It is a fact that Obamacare\u2019s main purpose is to redistribute wealth. Small business owners (primarily white) and middle-class Americans (primarily white) have been devastated by massive increases in health care costs: insurance premiums, copays, deductibles, cost of prescription drugs, and loss of coverage. Who has gained? Poor Americans who were handed free insurance coverage. It has been a direct transfer of wealth disguised as a health care program. Poor and nonworking Americans were handed a massive new entitlement program: \u201cwelfare in the form of free medical.\u201d As with every government program, middle-class Americans (pre- dominantly white) got the bill. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Economy Obama has passed the most dramatic tax increases along with the most onerous business regulations in history. Who were they aimed at? Predominantly white small business owners and middle-class Americans. We know how he feels about business owners. Remember when he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Immigration Obama has left the borders wide open, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to pour into America, all of whom expect cradle-to-grave entitlements. Don\u2019t forget, Obama has also fast-tracked the importation of about one million Muslims into America during his two terms.8 Well over 90 percent of these new Muslim immigrants are on food stamps, while almost 70 percent are on welfare. These stats are according to Obama\u2019s own Labor Department.9 We are fed lie after lie after lie about illegal immigration by Obama, Hillary, government bureaucrats, and, of course, the mainstream media. We are told that illegals are not flowing across the border. In a presidential debate, Hillary claimed there is no border problem. Wrong. Record numbers of illegals are coming across in 2016. As I write this book, the number of illegal aliens crossing the border is at an all-time record pace: 40 percent higher than the record set in 2014 and double the number in 2015.10 More illegals cross the border into Texas than babies born to native-born mothers in Texas each week.11 We are told that illegals are not costing America any- thing. We are told they are a \u201cnet gain.\u201d What a big fat lie. Earlier in the book I proved that illegal immigrants cost hundreds of billions of dollars in welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and other entitlements\u2014far more than native-born Americans, both percentage-wise and dollar-wise. We\u2019re told it\u2019s not \u201ceither/or.\u201d We\u2019re told America can afford to take care of American citizens and illegal immigrants. Another big fat lie. Obama just cut $2.6 billion from veterans, while allocating $4.5 billion to the importation and relocation of Syrian migrants. So why would a US president choose to cut money from vets in favor of fast-tracking Syrian migrants into our country? Why is that more important than taking care of veterans?12 So I guess it is \u201ceither/or.\u201d Vets, who happen to be in the predominantly white middle class, are getting shafted to pay for Muslim immigration. Perhaps the hundreds of billions spent on all other illegal immigrants is the reason there were no funds for VA hospitals and courageous heroes were put on fictitious waiting lists to die. Those heroes happened to be predominantly white middle-class citizens. In Obama\u2019s last budget as president, he demands nearly $18,000 for every illegal child or teenager from Central America who enters the country in 2016 (he expects over 75,000).13 That\u2019s $3,000 more than the average American senior citizen collects on Social Security, even though they were legally born in America, worked their entire lives, and paid into the system. So native-born Americans are getting out monies they already put in, and still they get less than some- one who comes here illegally. Keep in mind that many (if not most) of these children and teens might very well collect welfare for life. What does that cost the middle class? If you can\u2019t see that this is a purposeful attack on the predominantly white middle class, you\u2019re blind, deaf, or very dumb. We are told that illegals aren\u2019t criminals. Another big fat lie. One out of every five illegals has a criminal record (not including the crime of coming into the country). Illegals committed almost half a million crimes in Texas alone, just in the past four years. Half a million crimes\u2014in one state.14 Multiply that number across the country and tell me the cost to society in police, courts, public defenders, prosecutors, and prison costs? What is the cost to the victims? How about the Americans murdered at the hands of illegals? That\u2019s a pretty damn steep cost. Here\u2019s the most remarkable stat of all: 30 percent of all criminals in federal, state, and local prisons in the United States are illegal immigrants.15 This isn\u2019t happening by mistake or coincidence. The Obama administration is currently arguing in front of the US Supreme Court that Obama has the power to use executive action to instantly award Social Security to millions of immigrants illegally in the United States.16 Now let\u2019s move on to legal immigrants. Obama is purposely importing immigrants legally into the country who fit the parameters of his plan to \u201cfundamentally change America.\u201d From 2009 to 2013, the Obama administration issued twice as many green cards to immigrants from Muslim nations as European nations\u2014680,000 green cards for Muslims versus 270,000 for Europeans.17 Why is Obama choosing this ratio? Because this is how you \u201cfundamentally change America,\u201d \u201coverwhelm the sys- tem,\u201d and destroy capitalism, replacing it with socialism for a citizenry dependent on government entitlements to survive. The bonus is bringing in unskilled, uneducated, and dependent immigrants who will forever more vote Democrat to keep the freebies coming. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Obama doesn\u2019t discriminate. Every immigrant who needs welfare is welcome: Muslim, Mexican, Central American. Cubans are in a special class. All they have to do is get over the border and they are immediately met with a so-called \u201cWelcome Wagon\u201d that gives them instant cash, Social Security cards, food stamps, and Medicaid.18 As the country, health care, and school systems are all overwhelmed by massive costs for illegal immigration, and the debt rises to unimaginable levels, who pays for it all? American taxpayers. And who are they? The small business owners and middle-class Americans who spend their lives paying into the system and take almost nothing out. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Why doesn\u2019t someone stand up and say it\u2019s time to stop flooding the country with even more poor and unskilled immigrants, legal and illegal, and spend those billions upon billions of tax dollars now being given to them to improve America\u2019s inner cities and the lives of American citizens? Oh, guess what? Someone has. His name is Donald Trump! The Silicon Valley Jobs Scam Middle-class Americans don\u2019t realize the immigration scam isn\u2019t just about working stiffs. The cannon is aimed squarely at college-educated white-collar Americans, too. It\u2019s called H-1B visas. This is precisely why college grads with massive student loan debt are living in all-time record numbers in their parents\u2019 basement. This is why the icons of Silicon Valley are freaking out about the possible election of Donald Trump. These greedy and guilty white billionaires want to keep importing hundreds of thousands of low-wage foreigners to fill their jobs, instead of higher-paid American workers.19 The sad truth about Silicon Valley is that they fear Trump because they don\u2019t want to pay real wages to American white-collar college grads. Guest worker programs have devastated the predominantly white middle and upper classes. We\u2019ve been replaced by desperate foreigners willing to work for slave wages to get to (and stay in) America. They can never ask for a raise for fear of losing their H-1B visa. You want to know why we are angry white males? The H-1B program has resulted in massive job losses and a decade of wage deflation. The media paints illegals as victims just looking for a better life for their families. Well, here we\u2019re talking about American white-collar young adults who played by all the rules, graduated from good colleges, studied high technology, amassed massive student debt, and are being victimized by cheap legal foreign labor. They played by the rules and got screwed. Who\u2019s the victim now? Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Education The public school system has been ruined by teachers\u2019 unions, common core, and bleeding-heart liberal ideology. The school system is so bad, especially in America\u2019s larger cities, that parents who have any hope for their children\u2019s success spend their last dime on private schools, parochial schools, or homeschooling. That means business owners and taxpayers like myself are forced to pay double taxation. I\u2019m paying obscene, unaffordable property taxes to pay for public schools that I can\u2019t send my own kids to. At the same time, I\u2019m forced to pay $15,000 to $20,000 per child for alternative education. So business owners and middle-class taxpayers who pay into the system (made up of predominantly white taxpayers) are bled dry to give their children a proper education, while we\u2019re also forced to pay for a terrible free education for the children of the poor, who pay no taxes and pay nothing into the system. Since they pay nothing for it, it is easy for the vested political and corrupt union interests to get them to vote for higher and higher education spending even with that system continually failing even their children. So is it any wonder the goal of liberals like Obama and Hillary is to keep poor people poor and let more and more poor and unskilled people into America, so that eventually their votes outnumber native-born, hardworking, employed Americans. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Currency This is the most absurd example of all. Do you know what a president does when his policies have so badly damaged the economy, ruined health care, killed all decent middle- class jobs, destroyed GDP, and run up $9 trillion in new debt, resulting in black unemployment being double that of white and causing black violent crime to run wild in Democrat- ruled, black-dominated cities? Obama attempts to appease the masses of oblivious voters by changing the faces and images on the front and back of five-, ten-, and twenty-dollar bills to celebrate \u201csocial justice and diversity.\u201d It\u2019s called BREAD AND CIRCUS. And it\u2019s now clear that \u201cwe are Rome\u201d in the days just before the fall. Like Nero, Obama, his ignorant Kool-Aid-drinking socialist cabal, and the biased progressive media are fiddling while America burns. Obama has no clue how to turn around the economy or create jobs for black (or white) Americans, so he changes the faces on the currency to distract the masses. This is \u201cfeel-good,\u201d politically correct B.S. I\u2019m sorry, folks, but putting a heroic black woman like Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill (and she is an American hero) won\u2019t create a single job or raise the GDP above zero. Putting Martin Luther King on the back of the five-dollar bill won\u2019t help a stagnant economy. Just like everywhere else it\u2019s been tried, the reality is that Obama and his socialist cabal have proven an economy can- not be run based on diversity and social justice. Basing our currency on diversity and social justice won\u2019t help either. It\u2019s just BREAD AND CIRCUS to keep the masses from unrest and rioting. Keep in mind that Obama\u2019s treasurer, Jack Lew, ordered the mint to make the changes on currency a \u201cpriority.\u201d He also disclosed there was \u201cgreat pressure\u201d to showcase \u201cdiversity\u201d on our money. Really? From who? Who thinks in the middle of an Obama Great Depression the priority is putting images of civil rights leaders on our dollar, instead of making it a priority to create jobs and improve GDP? Insanity, ignorance, and reverse racism abounds. All of it is aimed at the predominantly white middle class. So much of what Obama and the liberals are doing, and the media is dutifully reporting, is simply a distraction, waste of resources, and pacifier so we won\u2019t notice how far worse things have gotten under Obama and his liberal policies. I\u2019ve saved perhaps the best for last. Don\u2019t Offend Criminals Not only is Obama demanding criminal backgrounds not be considered in hiring, but he no longer wants them to be called criminals. This is a new directive sent out to colleges by the Obama administration. The term \u201ccriminal\u201d might offend. Along with this directive came a pamphlet referring to convicted criminals as \u201cjustice-involved individuals.\u201d You can\u2019t make this up. Obama thinks a criminal is just someone \u201cinvolved with justice.\u201d We can\u2019t allow a rapist to be offended by calling him a rapist because names hurt! So now the per- son that raped your older daughter can go to work at your younger daughter\u2019s university without fear of being identified as or called a rapist. At worst, it might become known he is someone \u201cinvolved with justice.\u201d But then, in Obama\u2019s world, it wasn\u2019t their fault; a racist white society must have forced them to commit the crime. So from now on, just to be fair, no one should ever again be called racist. They are just \u201crace-involved individuals.\u201d Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Allow Criminals and Violent Felons to Vote Willie Horton But I\u2019m a \u201clemons to lemonade\u201d kind of guy. I\u2019m a positive thinker. This is more than just a travesty of justice. This is more than just the ruination of America. This is opportunity knocking. This is a gift there for the taking. The Democrats have handed Donald Trump the perfect TV ad to win the 2016 Presidential election. Lee Atwater, the famous Republican advertising whiz who destroyed 1988 Democrat presidential candidate Michael Dukakis with the Willie Horton TV commercial, must be looking down from heaven with an ear to ear smile. Governor McAuliffe just handed the election to the Donald Trump and the GOP if this is handled correctly. This is Willie Horton, Part Deux. It\u2019s like shooting fish in a barrel. Find mugshots of the murderers who just got voting rights. Find mugshots of the rapists who just got voting rights. Mix in a few drug dealers and pimps. Then channel the great Lee Atwater. Get to work creating the most devastating TV commercials in modern political history. What a tragic monumental mistake Democrats just made. Not just any Democrat\u2014the best friend, ally, and chief fundraiser of the Clintons. I can see the TV ads now. Picture this: SCREEN IMAGE: Image of Virginia DEMOCRAT Governor Terry McAuliffe . . . ANNOUNCER: Hillary and Bill\u2019s best friend and chief fund- raiser just gave a gift to the Clintons. He just gave voting rights to scum . . . dirtbags . . . murderers . . . the worst of the worst criminals in Virginia\u2014so they can register Democrat and vote for Hillary. SCREEN IMAGE: Mugshots of the most heinous criminals, with crimes listed under their faces. ANNOUNCER: Think about that. They murdered people . . . they raped people . . . they carjacked people . . . they invaded homes and terrorized people . . . they sold drugs . . . they beat people almost to death . . . they pimped and beat young girls. Their victims will never again feel safe again. But the murderer, rapist, or thug who sold drugs to children is out on street\u2014and voting for Hillary. This is the length to which Democrats will go to win elections. But wait, there\u2019s more. Not only can they vote; they can serve on a jury, become a notary public, and run for office. SCREEN IMAGE: Mugshot of murderer . . . now with a \u201cVOTE FOR ME\u201d ribbon across bottom of screen. Someday your rapist may run for office. Someday your child\u2019s drug dealer may serve on a jury. Someday you\u2019ll need a notary public\u2014and your mother\u2019s murderer will be notarizing your signature. SCREEN IMAGE: Hillary at Congressional hearing saying, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d This is the depth of depravity of Hillary Clinton and her allies. Democrats\u2014the party of murderers, rapists, and drug dealers. Hillary is right at home. VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Folks, it really is this bad. Yes, we are angry. And we have every right and reason to be. Sadly, it\u2019s a full-scale attack coming from all directions and it\u2019s getting worse.",

(AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Split screen frames Obama\u2019s struggle on race \u2022 Q Poll: Strong opposition to amnesty edict, Obama job approval approaches all-time low \u2022 Gruber set to testify \u2022 Hillary ad pushes social justice \u2022 When reindeer are outlawed, only outlaws will have reindeer SPLIT SCREEN FRAMES OBAMA\u2019S STRUGGLE ON RACE President Obama couldn\u2019t beat the rioters to the airwaves. Moments after the announcement of a grand jury\u2019s decision to not charge Officer Darren Wilson with a crime for shooting robbery suspect Michael Brown, Obama came before television viewers to call for calm and for media outlets to focus on peaceful protests taking place. But before Obama could get off the dais, the arson, riots and looting that would rage through the night had already begun. That split-screen image was the starkest illustration yet of the limitations of a man whose rationale for seeking the presidency despite a slim resume was his ability to meet what he said was America\u2019s greatest need: Someone \u201cto bring the country together.\u201d Obama explained in February 2007 that he would run because \u201cone of the skills that [he brings] to bear is being able to pull together the different strands of American life and focus on what we have in common.\u201d Nearly seven years later, quite the opposite has proven to be true. [Much blame in the media was placed not on the rioters themselves but on St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch\u2019s nighttime announcement. One television analyst called it an \u201cinvitation to chaos\u201d and others hinted McCulloch was trying to precipitate a riot.]Beyond divided - In his remarks amid the opening moments of Monday\u2019s riot, Obama said America has \u201cmade enormous progress in race relations\u201d over the past \u201cseveral decades.\u201d But any of Obama\u2019s recent predecessors certainly could have said the same thing. The more important question: How is Obama, who rationalized his upstart candidacy on his skills on the subject, doing at pulling together \u201cthe different strands\u201d of our culture? The broad consensus is strongly negative. Many on the left blame a racist backlash against the first non-white president, while many on the right blame a president who has embraced divisive politics and demonized rivals. But whatever the reasons, Obama\u2019s presidency has witnessed a marked decline in race relations in America. Americans have a dimmer view of race relations, with one poll showing a 10-point drop from 2013 to 2014 alone. But now, despite several \u201cmajor\u201d speeches on race the president said he is considering traveling to Ferguson where supporters say he should again try to give a talk to heal the nation\u2019s wounds. \u00a0But what would he say? [Not over yet - WaPo: \u201cThe Justice Department still has two opportunities to bring criminal charges and overhaul the Ferguson Police Department in the case that grew from the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown.]What would you say? - In his remarks Monday, Obama encouraged Americans to use their energies \u201cto start tackling much-needed criminal justice reform\u201d rather than engaging in violence. Obama was presumably referring to efforts to decrease mandatory minimum federal sentences for narcotics offenses, an idea with some bipartisan support. Other legislative options include state-level changes to laws governing the use of force by police officers, something highly unlikely in all but a few jurisdictions and an unlikely cause for a president. Obama bowed to the fact that he could not argue with the grand jury\u2019s decision saying \u2013 no doubt to the grimaces of Republicans who deem his recent temporary immigration amnesty a usurpation of power \u2013 \u201cFirst and foremost, we are a nation built on the rule of law. And so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury\u2019s to make.\u201d The other issues at hand, particularly activists\u2019 claims of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d or a deepening cultural famine among low-income families, defy simple solutions. For speeches to be \u201cmajor\u201d in the true sense, they have to contain a powerful idea and a call to action. It\u2019s hard to see Obama delivering such a speech in this waning phase of his presidency. [Fox News contributor Juan Williams writes: \u201cStreet violence only plays into the hands of racial provocateurs who are too weak to engage in the constant, ongoing struggle for equal rights and protections for black people. Those self-promoters are never around to clean up after a riot destroys a black neighborhood and tears at the trust between good people of all races.\u201d]Sharpton, again - As is usually the case amid racial unrest, the president is turning to MSNBC host Al Sharpton, a favorite of top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. Initially skeptical, it was reportedly Jarrett who convinced Sharpton together they could make changes for the country. The controversial television host advised Obama on the Trayvon Martin case, the selection process for the new attorney general, post-Election losses for the Democrats and the latest battle over immigration and executive action. In the initial days following the shooting of Michael Brown, it was said to be Jarrett who reached out to Sharpton to advise how to handle the situation.Q POLL: STRONG OPPOSITION TO AMNESTY EDICT AS OBAMA APPROVAL APPROACHES ALL-TIME LOWWith his approval rating dropping, a majority of Americans oppose President Obama\u2019s move to take unilateral action on immigration, according to a new poll. Forty-eight percent of respondents in the Quinnipiac University poll released today say the president should not go around Congress and issues an executive order, 43 percent say he should. The poll found a 9-point drop (to 48 percent) in support for allowing illegal immigrants to stay and be given a path to citizenship. Thirty-five percent say illegal immigrants should be required to leave. President Obama\u2019s approval rating dropped to 39 percent, one point shy of his lowest-ever approval score in a Q-poll.IT\u2019S A DATE: GRUBER SET TO TESTIFYObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, whose brags about tricking voters in passing the law has further damaged the administration\u2019s defense of the troubled program, has agreed to comply with a call to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Dec. 9.WITH HAGEL OUSTER, OBAMA\u2019S CIRCLE SHRINKSNYT: \u201cShortly after President Obama announced the resignation of Defense Secretary\u00a0Chuck Hagel\u00a0at the White House on Monday, he walked over to a meeting of his entire National Security Council staff, where he told the embattled group that they were critical to an ambitious foreign policy agenda. The timing was a coincidence, but it seemed an unmistakable sign that Mr. Hagel\u2019s departure does not portend a broader internal shake-up. \u00a0If anything, it may represent the final triumph of a White House-centric approach to national security. Mr. Obama does not appear likely to replace his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, who skirmished with Mr. Hagel over Syria policy and others. Nor is he mulling a change in his chief of staff,\u00a0Denis R.

This multi-billion-dollar orgy of consumerism brings increasing reports of violence in stores including the use of stun guns, pepper spray and knives. But what causes such extremes? Professor Laurence Ashworth writes that the impulses at work far predate the arrival of Tickle-Me Elmo. \u201cThe first is a valuable reward, something we are highly motivated to obtain. On Black Friday, the reward is a bargain\u2026The second condition is competition. And the competition originates in the limited number of products that are typically offered at the most heavily discounted prices\u2026the third relevant condition: the presence or absence of norms that might promote or prevent violent behavior.\u201d When those norms are disrupted by someone butting in line upsetting those following the norm, a free-for-all can ensue.

            "article_content": "Why didn't James Comey take questions after announcing he was recommending no charges in Clinton private email server scandal? Fox News' Catherine Herridge has insight for 'On the Record' FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that despite evidence Hillary Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified emails on a private server, the bureau will not recommend to the Department of Justice that criminal charges be brought against the former secretary of state. \u201cOur judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\u201d Comey said. Clinton's spokesman Brian Fallon issued a written statement shortly after the announcement. \"We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate.,\" he said. \"As the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are\u00a0glad that this matter is now resolved.\" FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem Clinton is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, blasted the FBI's decision on Twitter. \u201cFBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow!\u00a0#RiggedSystem\u201d he tweeted. Trump later issued two seperate statements on the matter including one that in part read: \"Comey let Clinton off the hook. ... The fix was final. The Obama administration's anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her path and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination.\" Despite not recommending charges be brought against Clinton, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of her actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information. He added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account. \"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" he said. Comey said seven email chains were classified at the \u201cTop Secret/Special Access Program level\u201d when they were sent and received on Clinton\u2019s server. \u201cThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton\u2019s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\u201d Comey said. Tuesday's decision helps remove what was arguably the biggest threat to her presidential campaign going forward \u2013 a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment \u2013 just weeks before her party\u2019s national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer. Clinton consistently had downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a \u201csecurity review,\u201d and as recently as June 3 said there was \u201cabsolutely no possibility\u201d she\u2019d be indicted. Weeks ago, a scathing State Department inspector general report directly countered her long-running claim that her personal email use was allowed, though her campaign continued to defend the candidate\u2019s actions. In the wake of that report, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, stepped up his criticism of her email actions and said she belongs in \u201cjail.\u201d The DOJ decision does not strip the email controversy as a campaign issue \u2013 Trump and the Republicans are sure to keep hammering it as the campaign lurches into full general election mode post-conventions \u2013 but shows the federal investigation did not determine the actions to be criminal, even if they were ill-advised and potentially damaging to national security. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the decision not to prosecute Clinton defied explanation, adding: \"No one should be above the law.\" The decision comes more than a year after knowledge of Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account and server first became public. Clinton responded at the time with a point-by-point written explanation and a press conference in which she said she had opted to use her personal server for \u201cconvenience.\u201d But critics said she was clearly circumventing government systems in order to try to shield her communications from public records requests, potentially putting sensitive and highly classified government secrets at risk in the process. During a subsequent review, more than 2,000 emails on the server were found to have contained information now deemed classified, though they apparently were not marked classified when sent.

Back-to-back murders of multiple police officers, first in Dallas and then in Baton Rouge, La., have cast a pall over the 2016 election, just as the Republican convention is set to begin.\u00a0 While police officers are all too often killed in the line of duty, these assaults, which are almost militant in style, and the accompanying racial tension are something different. In a year that has often felt out of control, these attacks add a new degree of anxiety. They also pose a profound challenge to the two major party candidates as they begin the stretch run of campaign. And for now at least, the burden is heaviest on Clinton and the Democrats. Having embraced, to varying degrees, the anger and energy behind anti-police brutality protesters, Clinton now finds herself in danger of being cast as anti-cop. And that\u2019s never a good thing to be in American politics. To meet the moment, Republicans are adding a new emphasis on law enforcement to their opening night here. And Trump himself has been repeating his refrain that he is the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate. Clinton, meanwhile, is on the southern side of the state to address the NAACP in Cincinnati. That would be a tough room under normal circumstances for Clinton, whose outreach to black voters has been\u00a0fraught at best. Clinton enjoys overwhelming support from minority voters, and did so in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries. But that seems to be more about ethnic partisan identification,\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, and the unsuitability of her opponents. Trump declined the invitation to speak to America\u2019s largest African American civil rights organization, a tacit acknowledgement that the GOP will continue to substantially cede black votes to Democrats. But what Clinton says to the NAACP will matter to voters of all ethnicities. Obama has struggled to find the right line between legitimizing the Black Lives Matter protest movement while still acting as an advocate for law enforcement. Clinton has nothing like the clout with black voters that Obama does, and has been eager to appear supportive of the anti-police brutality movement. She went so far as to repudiate the tough drug sentencing laws that were a cornerstone of her husband\u2019s own \u201claw and order\u201d candidacy twenty years ago. Democrats have long been plagued with the reputation for being less supportive of police and law enforcement than Republicans. As Trump channels 1968 winner Richard Nixon\u2019s message, he is invoking a painful chapter for Democrats as Republicans reached generational dominance fueled in part by anxiety over race riots and urban unrest. As the circle of history would have it, it was\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0who broke that cycle. He ran as tough on crime, pro-death penalty, and a Democrat who was willing to scold black activists for not condemning \u201ccop killer\u201d lyrics in rap music. Trump is hammering away on Clinton in hopes that she is so pinned down on the subject that she won\u2019t be able to fight back and reclaim her family\u2019s brand on the subject. Given how awkwardly Clinton has navigated this and other freighted issues it\u2019s not a bad bet for the GOP standard bearer to make.\u00a0 [Scheduled to speak in Cleveland tonight: Melania Trump, Former Lt.

            "article_content": "William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles Federal lawmakers seeking to pinpoint the number of illegal immigrants who successfully sneak across the southern border ordered up a report from the Department of Homeland Security, but the agency refuses to release it and instead cites a misleading statistic that overstates the number who are nabbed, sources told Fox News. DHS denied it is holding back the report, but sources say it was completed in November and that it shows roughly half of adults who attempt to cross the border make it - approximately 250,000 in total. But that number is at odds with DHS\u2019 official estimates. The agency claims authorities catch 80 percent of adults trying to sneak in, but critics say the figure is padded to make it appear border security is more effective than it really is. \"The Obama administration knows that the number of illegal aliens successfully getting across the Mexican border is 158 percent higher than they are telling people,\" said John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, who assessed the statistics for Fox News. \"The administration has made fraudulent changes in the numbers to hide this.\" If released by the Obama administration, the true numbers could have major implications in the current presidential race, in which illegal immigration and border security have become a key issue, say observers. One source familiar with the report told Fox News that DHS is suppressing the report for \"political reasons . . . because it would 'look bad' and 'help elect Donald Trump.\u201d Republican lawmakers are furious that the report they ordered is not being released. \u201cIt erodes the trust as to whether the administration is being honest with the American people about what the threat is,\u201d said Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., who serves on the Committee on Homeland Security and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. \u201cThis should not be a partisan issue. Democrats, Independents and Republicans in my community want to make sure that border communities are safe.\u201d The report was requested by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees as part of the Fiscal 2016 Omnibus Bill, but has been shrouded in secrecy. Viewed by a select few in key administration figures, critics say it is being withheld because of its explosive findings, which could potentially benefit GOP nominee Donald Trump. FoxNews.com requested a copy from both DHS and the White House, but was told the report is not yet finished, an assertion disputed by sources familiar with the process. \u201cAny suggestion that DHS is delaying release of a report on new border enforcement measures for political reasons is false,\u201d a DHS spokesperson told Fox News. \u201cTo the contrary, at Secretary Johnson\u2019s direction, DHS has been making significant progress in the development of such measures. At this point, however, the work is still preliminary and requires further refinement, to ensure the new measures are accurate and reliable. \u201cThe November 2015 report purportedly obtained by Fox News is one building block provided by a research organization DHS has been working with to develop these measures,\" the spokesperson added. The study was written by analysts from DHS and the outside firm Institute for Defense Analyses, and is the most extensive survey of illegal activity and U.S. enforcement at the southwest border to date. Researchers went to the southwest border three times over 9 months and conducted independent surveys of Mexican migrants caught by the Border Patrol. They also reviewed Border Patrol intelligence, internal DHS records, apprehensions at ports of entry and detention records. The report was peer reviewed by a number of experts. The document examines, in part, the Interdiction Effectiveness Rate (IER), or the number of adults caught at the border by law enforcement. But when DHS briefed members of the House and Senate earlier this year, sources familiar with the report say it was blended with non-IER statistics, such as unaccompanied children and those who surrendered to Border Patrol. Those figures were used to buttress the claim that only 20 percent of would-be illegal immigrants are successful when the real IER estimation was half, sources said. \u201cThere is a distrust, because of the shifting measurements,\u201d McSally said. \u201cWe would like to follow up with those researchers and better understand what is going on related to suppressing those results, if that\u2019s an accurate report.\u201d It is concerning, but not surprising, that the Obama administration has kept secret this credible research, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy research for the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cIt appears to me that this research could have been suppressed because it contradicts the Obama administration\u2019s narrative that the border is secure, and it contradicts the administration\u2019s wish for people to believe that illegal immigration is a thing of the past,\u201d Vaughan said. The taxpayer-funded research should be released to the public and available for review by experts, said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a co-author of the CFR report, \u201cManaging Illegal Immigration to the United States: How Effective is Enforcement.\u201d \u201cHow can we expect Congress to make decisions on border enforcement if it doesn\u2019t know how many people are entering illegally, if it doesn't know the apprehension rate, if it doesn\u2019t know the detection rate\u2026. what percentage of people the border patrol is seeing,\u201d Alden said. \u201cAll of these are critical variables about making intelligence decisions about border enforcement and they simply at the moment are not in the hands of the Congress and the public.\u201d The irony is the data, by and large, reveals what appears to be a \u201cgood news\u201d story, Alden said. \u201cWe have seen a significant decline in illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States and it's clear that the Border enforcement build-up has been a big reason why that decline has been as sharp as it has been,\u201d Alden said. \u201cOur estimates suggest that the number of successful illegal entries has fallen from extremely high numbers -- more than 3 million annually up to the mid-2000s -- to much, much smaller numbers, about 250,000 last year. Keep in mind that these numbers do not represent individuals who came to stay in the United States \u2013 these are the total number of illegal border crossings.\u201d The numbers have fallen dramatically in recent years partly due to economic and demographic changes, such as a smaller population of young Mexicans looking for work, Alden said. But enforcement also has played a significant role because the odds of getting caught while crossing have gone up and, more importantly, the consequences for getting caught are much greater, he acknowledged. The Institute for Defense Analyses report is not classified or marked in any way and can be publicly disseminated without restriction, sources said. But the chances of it getting out look dim, as a decades-old report also commissioned by DHS -- the 2006 \"CBP Apprehensions at the Border\" study prepared by the Homeland Security Institute -- also has never been released.",

            "article_content": "The GOP nominee counseled himself not to blow the ultimate push; Carl Cameron reports for 'Special Report' Presidential contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton held near-simultaneous rallies in the battleground state of North Carolina Thursday evening, during which Trump claimed Clinton committed perjury and Clinton said Trump's election would lead to \"normalizing discrimination.\" North Carolina's 15 electoral votes have emerged as a key part of Trump's path to victory. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed Clinton and Trump in a close race among North Carolina voters. At a rally in Selma, Trump tried to court North Carolina's sizable military vote, delivering his stump speech flanked by a dozen veterans onstage. The real estate mogul told the crowd that \"we know Hillary can't be trusted\" with national security, a reference to the ongoing FBI investigation of Clinton's private email server, and called the former secretary of state \"the most dishonest person ever to run for office.\" \"When I look at these great admirals and great generals ... behind me, to think of her being their boss? I don't think so,\" Trump said, adding that such \"incredible patriots ... would never say a thing\" about Clinton \"but I know what they're thinking.\" Trump then cited a CBS News report that FBI agents have discovered previously unseen emails related to Clinton's State Department tenure on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of the Democratic nominee's top aide, Huma Abedin. \"Remember they said 'They're duplicates, they're duplicates,'\" Trump said. \"How can there be duplicates? Hillary therefore committed perjury because of her statements [to the FBI] in addition to all her other crimes.\" Approximately 30 miles to the northwest in Raleigh, Clinton was addressing a rally to boost early voting turnout, especially among African-Americans. She was joined by her former primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and hip-hop producer Pharrell Williams. Clinton decried what she called the \"distressful\" tone of the campaign, saying that \"I've had people say that they can't sleep, their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches.\" Clinton then pivoted to an attack on Trump, saying that his past reported comments about women, the disabled, Muslims and other groups have \"already revealed who he is.\" She discussed Trump's conduct in the now-infamous 1989 \"Central Park Five\" rape case, in which five black and Latino teens were convicted of sexual assault before later being exonerated. Last month, Trump said the teens \"admitted they were guilty.\" \"If he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can he fight for fairness and justice?\" Clinton asked. \"Do we want him appointing our judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\" President Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina in 32 years when he took the state in 2008. Republican Mitt Romney won it back in 2012.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee speaks following Trump victory Comedian Louis C.K. stopped by Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s show last week and weighed in on the presidential race. Louis, like so many Hollywood types, was all in for Hillary. He didn\u2019t offer the usual roundup of her accomplishments or record that so many have fallen back on throughout this campaign, but I wouldn\u2019t have expected him to \u2013 he\u2019s a comedian, after all. But what he did do was so much more important. Louis zeroed in on two critical factors to Hillary\u2019s readiness to serve as the 45th president of the United States: she\u2019s a mom and she can take abuse. We have heard a lot about how important motherhood (and grandmotherhood) is to Hillary, but not in the way Louis put it. For him, Hillary would make the best president because \u201cWe\u2019ve had 240 years of fathers\u2026and fathers are okay\u2026a great father can give a kid 40 percent of its needs and any mother \u2013 a not even trying mother \u2013 [gives] 200 percent.\u201d That isn\u2019t an argument for a female president \u2013 which we\u2019ve heard over and over again \u2013 but for a woman who knows the importance of caring for a child, the dedication it takes to raise a person right and unconditional love. The ability to give yourself over to others and to put them first, which is in many cases unique to mothers. NB: I\u2019m a big fan of fathers, too, but to argue they give themselves over equally on the whole is just too progressive \u2013 and wrong \u2013 for me. And I\u2019m in a bipartisan mood and still acclimating to my Donald Trump presidency reality and don\u2019t want to spill too much ink on dissing the president-elect, but I doubt there\u2019s anyone out there who would argue that Trump gives 200 percent like a great mom. Louis\u2019s second, and perhaps more salient point, was that we need somebody in the White House who can take abuse. It\u2019s the hardest job in the world. The presidency comes with the greatest level of scrutiny and criticism of any position. It is not for the thin-skinned (or the Twitter rant prone). That\u2019s why in his closing argument Louis said, \u201cWe need somebody who can take abuse and Hillary Clinton can take abuse. She\u2019s been taking it and taking it. We\u2019ve been hazing her, we\u2019ve been holding her down and spitting in her mouth and yelling at her and she just gets up and goes well I just think that if children have proper healthcare and education.\u201d This is what it comes down to for me. Hillary never backs down and she just keeps fighting. I think that in this totally mad election we lost sight of what a hero Hillary is for not just women, but for Americans in shattering so many glass ceilings, but more importantly for taking all the abuse and coming back for more. I\u2019m an admitted Hillary fan-girl, but even the coldest hearted Republicans will have to admit that she has always wanted every American to have health care, a chance at a quality education and opportunity for a bright future. Sure, she shouldn\u2019t have had a private email server. Everybody knows that. And the Clinton Foundation has given me a headache or two (in addition to saving millions of lives, more importantly). But to reduce this election down to how Hillary blew it because she wasn\u2019t a campaigner like Obama or her husband or the scandals surrounding her server or the Clinton Foundation did her in does such a deep disservice to this remarkable woman. I was disappointed to see that female voters didn't come out for Hillary in the way the polls predicted because I do think it\u2019s meaningful for women to support other women. And not just any woman. This woman. As for what the future holds, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But I do know that whatever Hillary does, she\u2019s going to keep giving 200 percent and taking abuse. And for that, we should thank her.",

            "article_content": "Florida goes from leaning Democrat to a toss-up; Nevada goes from Dem to loss-up and N.C. goes from toss-up to lean Dem. Shannon Bream examines these changes and more in the latest Fox News electoral map The 2016 presidential race is, borrowing a phrase from Donald Trump, once again keeping America in \u201csuspense\u201d \u2013 with the polls and the electoral map being scrambled in the final days amid a slew of late-breaking developments. Just one week ago, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had assumed a confident air on the stump, enjoying a rare period when the political pieces were aligning for her in the wake of damaging allegations against her Republican rival. But the polls are tightening again, as voters assess a range of other factors, including the FBI\u2019s stunning decision to revisit her private email investigation. Election prognosticators still say Clinton enjoys the advantage going into the big day \u2013 in large part because the states President Obama won in 2012 mostly have stayed Democrat-leaning this year, giving her a substantial built-in advantage. But, even though Trump faces a tough climb to the 270 electoral votes it takes to win, the map is changing in the final days, in several cases in his favor. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard has moved both Florida and Nevada \u2013 two states previously rated \u201clean Democrat\u201d \u2013 into the \u201ctoss-up\u201d category, citing shifts in the polls. The same update moved Alaska from \u201csolid Republican\u201d to \u201clean Republican\u201d and North Carolina from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Democrat.\u201d But in another indicator of how difficult the race is to gauge, a new WRAL News poll showed Trump with a 7-point lead in North Carolina, despite other polls showing Clinton ahead. National polls show the race tightening up into a virtual draw. The latest ABC News/ Washington Post tracking poll shows the candidates tied, 46-46 percent. As with any election year, what matters is what happens in the battlegrounds. \u201cIn the end, the popular vote isn\u2019t what matters. It\u2019s the Electoral College,\u201d pollster Frank Luntz told Fox News. \u201cAnd that Electoral College map is very difficult for Donald Trump, even though in every other indicator, it\u2019s moving in the right direction for him.\u201d The Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows all the \u201csolid\u201d and \u201clean\u201d Democrat states would give Clinton 287 electoral votes, more than enough to take the White House. The Republican-rated states give Trump 174. To win, Trump would need to lock down the toss-up states as well as pick off territory from the Democratic column. On the campaign trail, Trump is sounding more confident of his chances, no longer focusing as heavily on warnings that the vote would be \u201crigged\u201d against him. \u201cIn just one week, we are going to win the great state of Wisconsin and we are going to win back the White House \u2026 lotta\u2019 good polls out there today,\u201d he declared at a rally Tuesday night in Eau Claire, Wis., while also citing the North Carolina poll. Trump has seized on a spate of developments, including the FBI\u2019s investigation of newly discovered emails on a laptop used by Clinton adviser Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband Anthony Weiner \u2013 as well as the tidal wave of revelations from WikiLeaks-posted emails from the Clinton campaign chairman\u2019s hacked account. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, has returned to hammering Trump over alleged Russia connections and his alleged mistreatment of women. On this theme, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado introduced Clinton at a rally in Dade City, Fla., telling the crowd she was \u201cscared\u201d of Trump. Machado made headlines after accusing Trump of being verbally abusive to her by calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d when she held the 1996 Miss Universe title. \u201cHe made fun of me and I didn\u2019t know how to respond,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "William La Jeunesse reports from Nogales, Arizona Americans aren\u2019t the only ones motivated by Tuesday\u2019s election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. \u201cSmugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there\u2019s a chance,\u201d said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. \u201cPeople think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,\u201d said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. \u201cAnother faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they\u2019ll get amnesty if they\u2019re here by a certain date.\u201d Those two competing narratives \u2013 triggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively -- are driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn\u2019t seen in years in some sectors. \u201cWe are overwhelmed,\u201d said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. \u201cWe are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.\u201d In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide -- and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming\u00a0to be from Africa and Asia also is up. \"There are always going to be push and pull factors that influence an individual\u2019s decision to make that trek,\" said Tucson Border Patrol Sector Chief Paul Beeson. The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their\u00a0\u2018asylum\u2019 claim. \u201cWhen you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m here for asylum, I can\u2019t go home because they\u2019ll kill me.\u2019 \u2026 When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,\u201d said Cabrera. \u201cOnce they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we\u2019ll never see them again.\u201d Del Cueto said the agents are \u201cnot getting any backing\u201d from D.C. and \u201cwe need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.\u201d Del Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrol\u2019s 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media. While Central American immigrants have posed the biggest resource challenge for Texas, they say a surge of Haitians are pouring into ports of entry in California and Arizona. Last year, the U.S. saw a 500 percent increase of Haitians admitted to the U.S., double that in San Diego where right now 2,000 are waiting outside the port in San Ysidro.\u00a0According to Homeland Security sources, another 2,000 are in Mexicali and several hundred are in San Luis, just south of Yuma where Del Cueto says immigrants are sleeping in a church parking lot. Further east in Nogales, Mexico, 150 are waiting to cross into the U.S. They are camped next to the border fence, waiting for Customs and Border Protection officers to process them as refugees. Some had jewelry and one woman had an iPad. The men surrounded the women, who huddled around a pile of boxes containing water and food. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in Nogales 20 days,\u201d said one middle-aged man in a striped shirt in broken English. \u201cWe need help crossing the border.\u201d He said each immigrant paid a $4,000 to $6,000 smuggling fee. Once here, he said the Mexican government had given each a number based on their arrival. \u201cWe are seeing an uptick in the number of Haitians that are looking for an immigration benefit,\u201d\u00a0said Beeson, who admits the surge is taking agents off the front lines. Following the earthquake several years ago, Haitians were allowed to immigrate and stay in the U.S. under a program known as \u2019Temporary Protected Status.\u2019 Earlier this year, the U.S. ended that protection, leaving some Haitians in the pipeline traveling through Mexico, where according to officials there, roughly 8,000 are on their way to the border. While Trump and Clinton have very different visions of immigration reform and border security, Stratfor\u2019s Scott Stewart doesn\u2019t see the border threat changing until conditions do south of the border. \u201cThere\u2019s really no easy answer to it because there are just deeper issues,\u201d said Stewart, from the defense and security think tank. \u201cYou have pervasive corruption where you see all levels of government are involved in, you know, drug dealing and other criminal activity. \u2026 So these things all tie together and make it a very difficult place for people to live and survive and because of that it\u2019s very understandable why people would want to migrate from those conditions up to the United States.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Republican nominee speaks to Carl Cameron Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Monday night at a campaign rally in Wisconsin that newly released FBI records reveal \"a criminal act\" he claims is worse than Watergate while calling for a senior State Department official to resign. \"This is one of the great miscarriages of justice in the history of our country,\" he said. Newly released FBI documents revealed Monday that a senior State Department official proposed a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to convince the FBI to strip the classification on an email from Hillary Clinton\u2019s server \u2013 and repeatedly tried to \u201cinfluence\u201d the bureau\u2019s decision when his offer was denied, even taking his plea up the chain of command. Fox News first reported Saturday that the FBI interview summaries and notes, known as 302s, contained allegations of a quid pro quo. Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who initially told Fox News of the claim, called it a \u201cflashing red light of potential criminality.\u201d Documents published Monday morning confirm the account. Notes from an interview with an unnamed FBI official reveal the State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy tried to horse-trade with the FBI, offering additional slots for the bureau overseas if they would de-classify a particular email marked \u201cSECRET.\u201d Trump accused the State Department Monday night of \"trying to cover up Hillary's crimes of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access.\" He also blasted Kennedy, saying his actions were a sign of a \"cover-up.\" \"The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a 'quid pro quo,' in other words a deal,\" Trump told supporters. \"This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.\" Before his rally, Trump described the actions by the State Department to Fox News' Carl Cameron as \"a criminal act,\" while also hurling criticisms at fellow Republicans. \"It's a crime, and I hear the Republicans are going to hold hearings after the election, why would you hold them after the election? We want to hold those hearings before the election,\" Trump said. \"It's a criminal act and it's incredible that they can do this and get away with it.\" When asked if he was taking shots at Republicans again, Trump pushed back as to why hearings should be held sooner. \"I mean, you'd think you'd hold these hearings frankly immediately, this is serious stuff,\" Trump told Fox News. \"This is big stuff. This is Watergate.\" When asked further by Cameron about his recent public hostility with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who represents Wisconsin, Trump said he was \"trying to unite the party.\" \"I mean every once in a while Paul will stand up and say he disagrees with this or that,\" he told Fox News. \"For instance when I talked about a rigged election, when I talk about the press taking people with no case whatsoever and putting them on the front pages.\" Before Trump took the stage at his rally, the crowd broke into chants of \"Paul Ryan sucks,\" the Associated Press reported. The man introducing Trump on Monday, Wisconsin GOP Chairman Brad Courtney, was reportedly briefly drowned by the chant. While continuing to discuss his plan to reform government, the Republican nominee claimed he'll \"end government corruption\" if he's elected to the White House. Trump said he wants to ban executive branch officials from lobbying the government for five years after they leave the White House -- and wants Congress to do the same for members and their staffs. He also wants to expand the definition of lobbyist and is calling for a lifetime ban on senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.

            "article_content": "File photo - Police officers watch as protesters rally during a demonstration leading up to the NATO Summit in Chicago May 18, 2012. (REUTERS/Eric Thayer) If you\u00a0want\u00a0to see the face of violence, rage, and hopelessness in America today, take a good look inside our failing inner cities and the desperate people who are struggling to survive. Start with Chicago. Sixty-five people were shot in Chicago over the Labor Day\u00a0weekend, thirteen of those shootings ended with fatalities including a retired pastor. In Baltimore, several triple shootings broke out during the long holiday weekend. Twenty-two people were hit with gunfire, four people died and four others were listed in critical condition. The shooting victims in Baltimore included a 60-year-old woman and two children -- ages 4 and 6. Prior to the torrent of violence, Baltimore authorities noted how they had managed to go six entire days without a homicide \u2013 an unusual feat for the\u00a0beleaguered\u00a0city.\u00a0\u00a0New York and Los Angeles now have a combined 409 homicides recorded so far this year. Chicago\u2019s Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson speaks candidly about the violence in his city and how it emanates from impoverished neighborhoods and from people who are literally, \u201cwithout hope.\u201d Johnson clearly believes Chicago\u2019s problem of violence cannot be conveniently laid at the feet of the police, as the Black Lives Matter movement and other\u00a0vocal\u00a0activists propose.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, Johnson says, \u201cIt\u2019s not a police issue, it\u2019s a society issue.\u201d Departing Washington, D.C. chief Cathy Lanier had her own observations as she moves to a new assignment with the NFL.\u00a0 According to the Washington Post, Lanier lamented that, \u201cThe criminal justice system in this city is broken.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Among her reasons for leaving the department she\u2019s worked in for more than two decades, was\u00a0the lack of outrage over repeat offenders.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is beyond broken.\u00a0\u201c Listen to Jesse Jackson and you get a very different story.\u00a0\u00a0Jackson says the Chicago police department is part of the most corrupt justice system in America and he accuses Chicago\u2019s police of taking part in, \u201clegal lynching.\u201d \u202fThe Huffington Post recently published a story from their Black Voices Senior Editor\u202fsaying the following: \u201cBlack Lives\u00a0Matter (BLM) wasn\u2019t built to incite any form of violence against police.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, it\u2019s one of the dangerous misconceptions about the movement the group has sought to debunk.\u201d Perhaps this Huffington Post editor missed the videos of BLM protestors in St.\u00a0Paul, Minnesota,\u00a0shouting, \u201cPigs in a blanket, fry 'em\u00a0like bacon.\u201d\u00a0Or others marching in New York City chanting, \u201cWhat do we want?\u00a0 Dead cops.\u00a0 When do we want them?\u00a0 Now!\u201d How do\u00a0these\u00a0reprehensible\u00a0mantras\u202fwork toward a nonviolent goal? Political opportunist and\u00a0inveterate\u00a0race baiter Reverend Al Sharpton is a staunch supporter of the BLM movement\u00a0with\u00a0a long history of fabricating charges against police.\u00a0\u00a0Who can forget Sharpton\u2019s dishonest crusade in the 1980\u2019s railing against the \u201cattack\u201d on\u00a0Tawana\u00a0Brawley \u2013 a woman who falsely claimed to have been sexually assaulted by white police officers.\u00a0\u00a0Sharpton regularly marches with the BLM movement and uses liberal television and his half million Twitter followers to make sweeping, unfounded accusations against police. Where is the public repudiation of Al Sharpton from BLM leaders if the movement truly doesn\u2019t condone violence? Buzzfeed\u2019s\u00a0Ben Smith reported in August of this year how Sharpton, \u201c\u2026.admires and talks to some of the Black Lives Matter activists, including\u00a0DeRay\u00a0Mckesson, whom he sees as goal-oriented.\u201d There will never be any repudiation of Al Sharpton from BLM\u00a0or of BLM from Sharpton\u00a0because their interests are mutual \u2013 blame the police first, check\u00a0the\u00a0facts later, if at all. \u202fAnd if the unambiguous facts don\u2019t support the anti-cop narrative, cast suspicion and doubt on them\u00a0anyway, claim the entire system is rigged. Public bashing of our police has become so politically\u00a0convenient, we now have to listen to vapid Hollywood elites\u00a0and pampered millionaire athletes\u00a0offer their shallow commentary.\u00a0\u00a0When NFL\u00a0bench-warmer\u00a0Colin\u00a0Kaepernick\u00a0takes a knee during the national anthem or shows up to practice wearing his \u201cpig socks\u201d he adds his name to the list of uninformed activists and organizations who know virtually nothing about these issues\u00a0and\u202fuse\u202fa convenient blue scapegoat for\u00a0systemic\u00a0inner city problems. Our\u00a0president does the nation no service when he announces how he can empathize with\u00a0Kaepernick\u2019s\u00a0plight. The president heeds the words and actions of a multi-million dollar athlete who has never met once with any law enforcement official to\u202freach\u202fan informed opinion regarding\u00a0the challenges of\u00a0policing\u00a0in America today\u00a0or cared to recognize the myriad problems plaguing inner cities that the police are expected to somehow fix when a person dials 911. There is little thoughtful discussion of the realities and daily stresses of police work, the split-second decision-making required \u2013 often with life changing consequences, or the need for additional training,\u00a0equipment, and funding\u00a0for\u00a0thousands of\u00a0local departments. As violent crime rates rise\u00a0in city after city\u00a0after more than twenty years of decline, the men and women in blue\u00a0now stand\u00a0in a political hailstorm.\u00a0\u00a0In many of the same cities where protesters lined up to defame, curse\u00a0or threaten\u00a0police\u00a0while exercising the very First Amendment rights their victims are sent to protect, law abiding citizens are begging for police patrols to return in force\u00a0where\u00a0the thugs now rule. Police walk the streets today fearful their next citizen encounter will become a much maligned viral video or fodder for a public witch\u00a0hunt against them or their families. Others will\u00a0become\u00a0sudden and\u00a0unwarranted\u00a0targets of violence simply because\u00a0of the uniform they wear. In the remaining days of this election season, we can expect to see more pandering and posturing by liberal candidates and activists who are happy to point an accusatory finger at police. It\u2019s time we discuss the real causes for the escalating violence in our cities and engage in\u00a0substantive discussions\u00a0to find ways to keep people safe. Questions regarding proper use of force and public safety should transcend party politics.\u00a0\u00a0Instead they have become a means to incite more violence in our cities and spur a far-reaching, often baseless propaganda campaign to blame the blue.",

            "article_content": "Fox News Auto's Gary Gastelu says there's plenty of sport in the 2016 Mazda CX-9 SUV. Mazda would like you to believe the CX-9 is a three-row Miata. Ha! It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true. The all-new crossover is a bright spot of fun in an otherwise very functional segment, though this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. As the ads say, \u201cDriving matters,\u201d and that truly applies to every car and crossover Mazda makes. When you\u2019re the little guy, it helps to stand out. The $32,420 CX-9 is far from small on the outside. It\u2019s longer than many of the vehicles it competes against, including the Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander. A prominent shark nose adds a few of those inches and flows into a very long hood. It enhances an athletic profile that I\u2019d describe as unique if it didn\u2019t resemble Jaguar\u2019s new F-Pace, even if Mazda had it first. (Mazda) The sloping rear roof cuts into the trunk, however, which is also narrow with a high floor. If you\u2019re in the market for maximum cargo carrying, the cavernous Honda Pilot is a better bet. That goes for people carrying, too. The Pilot can seat up to eight with room to spare. The seven-passenger CX-9\u2019s third row can fit two adults, but they won\u2019t be thrilled. (Mazda) The story is different up front. The styling and materials would work for a premium brand, especially in high-end models, like the top-of-the-line Signature I tested with an out-the-door price of $45,215. It\u2019s trimmed with real aluminum, electric guitar-spec rosewood and nappa leather, and they didn\u2019t miss a spot where it matters. Refinement has never been Mazda\u2019s strong suit, but it\u2019s finally figured it out with the CX-9. The doors shut with an authoritative \u201cthunk,\u201d and it\u2019s as quiet as the proverbial bank vault on the move. And, boy, how it moves. All CX-9s \u2013 whether front- or all-wheel-drive \u2013 have a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. It\u2019s rated at 227 hp on regular gas, but a tank of premium will round up another 23 horses. That\u2019s not a lot for a vehicle this size, but the 310 lb-ft of torque that goes with it is. Some full-size pickups have less, and only the twin-turbo V6 Ford Explorer and HEMI V8 Dodge Durango offer more in the CX-9's class. Nevertheless, the Mazda delivers unbeatable fuel economy: 23 mpg combined in AWD models and 25 mpg combined for two-wheel-drivers. The CX-9 is relatively light and gets up to speed in a hurry, but it\u2019s what it does when it gets there that pulls it ahead of the competition. The body is solid, the steering is responsive and the suspension is tuned with body control and handling in mind. There are sedans that are less able and entertaining on a windy road. Even the brakes impress. The front seats aren\u2019t very soft, but they\u2019re deep and supportive, and their racy shape fits the car\u2019s overall vibe well. A head-up display helps keep your eyes on the twists, turns and traffic in the road, while a full suite of optional driver aids (emergency braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, etc.) is on call for less interesting highway slogs. Like all Mazdas these days, the CX-9 has an infotainment system with a large tablet-style touchscreen on top of the dashboard and a rotary controller. It\u2019s fine, but the software is a little dated, and it doesn\u2019t offer Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. The excellent Bose audio system it controls is a nice consolation. You won\u2019t need it to get into the groove, though. A mountain road will do just fine. Just follow the Miatas. They\u2019ll show you how to find one. ---------- 2016 Mazda CX-9 Base price: $32,420 As tested: $45,215 Type: 4-door, 7-passenger CUV Engine: 2.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder Power: 227 hp/310 lb-ft torque Transmission: 6-speed automatic MPG: 21 city/27 hwy",

            "article_content": "On 'Fox & Friends,' the governor on why the state could decide America's future JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.  \u2013 Republicans won control of governors' offices in Missouri, New Hampshire and Vermont on Tuesday, picking up a trio of previously Democratic seats in their quest to expand their statehouse leadership to their strongest levels in decades. The governors' contests in a dozen states were part of a battle for statehouse supremacy that also included nearly 6,000 state legislative elections. Heading into Tuesday, Republicans controlled more than two-thirds of the nation's legislative chambers, as well as 31 of the 50 governors' offices. They were inching toward their historical high of 34 governorships sent in 1922, with races in North Carolina and Montana still too close to call early Wednesday. In a key legislative battle, Republicans also won control of the Kentucky House \u2014 the lone remaining Democratic-held chamber in the South \u2014 for the first time in nearly a century while defeating Democratic House Speaker Greg Stumbo. And Republicans reclaimed the Iowa Senate from Democrats, giving them control of both legislative chambers and the governor's office. The states in play Tuesday included: ___ MISSOURI Former Navy SEAL officer Eric Greitens defeated Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster in the state's costliest-ever gubernatorial race. He will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon to become just the second Republican governor in the past 24 years. Greitens capitalized on his military service and his work as founder of the veterans' charity known as The Mission Continues. He cast himself as an outsider going up against a career politician. Koster, a former Republican state senator, had picked up key endorsements from the National Rifle Association and major agricultural groups. Including primary candidates, Missouri governors' campaigns raised more than $72 million, easily doubling the previous record. ___ VERMONT Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott defeated Democrat Sue Minter to take over the office held by Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin, who chose not to run for another two-year term. Scott is currently the only Republican statewide officeholder in a liberal-leaning state but has tacked to the left by embracing abortion rights and gay marriage and pledged to make government more efficient. Minter was a former transportation secretary for Shumlin. ___ NEW HAMPSHIRE Republican Chris Sununu defeated Democrat Colin Van Ostern in a close race set up by Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan's decision to forgo re-election in order to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Sununu is the son of former Gov. John H. Sununu and the brother of former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu. He has served on the governor's Executive Council with Van Ostern. Democrats had controlled the governor's office for 18 of the past 20 years. ___ NORTH CAROLINA Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper claimed victory early Wednesday in a close race against Gov. Pat McCrory, but the Republican incumbent told his supporters \"the election is not over\" while citing uncounted votes and provisional ballots. Cooper was ahead by just a few thousand votes out of more than 4.6 million counted. The race has become a referendum on North Carolina's rightward shift under McCrory, highlighted by a law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and directs transgender people to use public restrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates. Cooper has vowed to try to repeal the law as governor. ___ INDIANA Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb won election over Democrat John Gregg to continue a 12-year run of Republican governors in Indiana. Holcomb, a former state Republican Party chairman, had had been appointed to the state's No. 2 spot by Gov. Mike Pence and later was nominated as his replacement when Pence dropped his re-election bid in July to run for vice president. Gregg had tried to cast Holcomb as a \"rubber stamp\" for Pence, pointing out Holcomb's support for a religious-objections law that Pence signed. Opponents said the law, which was later revised, sanctioned discrimination against same-sex couples by allowing businesses to refuse to serve them. ___ WEST VIRGINIA Jim Justice's victory will continue a 16-year stint of Democratic governors in a state that has otherwise been tilting toward Republicans. Justice, the state's wealthiest resident, cast himself as a political outsider adept at creating jobs. Republican candidate Bill Cole, the state Senate president, had hoped to ride Trump's coattails. But Cole's pledge to revive the coal industry was offset by Justice, himself a coal billionaire. Justice will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin. ___ MONTANA Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was in a close race against Republican Greg Gianforte, a computer software firm founder who poured millions of his own money into the race. Gianforte aired more TV ads than all other statewide executive candidates in the nation, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity of data from the tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. Bullock was heavily aided by the Democratic Governors Association. ___ OTHER STATES In Delaware, Democratic U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. was elected to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jack Markell. And in North Dakota, Republican businessman Doug Burgum won election to replace Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who did not seek re-election. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert won re-election in Utah, and Democratic Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington also turned back challengers.",

            "article_content": "Kristin Fisher reports from Washington, D.C. Donald Trump is rapidly ratcheting up the rhetoric as the 2016 candidates charge out of their respective party conventions, warning Monday the November presidential election could be \u201crigged\u201d and repeatedly calling Democratic rival Hillary Clinton \u201cthe devil\u201d \u2013 while his campaign tried to draw financial links between the Clinton Foundation and ISIS. Speaking Tuesday morning to Fox Business Network, the Republican nominee also called Clinton a \u201cdisaster\u201d and a \u201cliar.\u201d \u201cShe lied over the weekend,\u201d Trump said, citing her widely challenged claim to \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the FBI director determined her statements on her personal email use were \u201ctruthful.\u201d The onslaught of accusations \u2013 signaling a new and tougher phase in a campaign already characterized by sharp elbows and name-calling \u2013 picked up late Monday, as Trump railed against his general election rival during stops in Ohio and later Pennsylvania, and in media interviews. He went so far as to suggest November could be fixed. \"I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,\" the Republican nominee told a town hall crowd in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday. He added that he has been hearing \"more and more\" that the election may not be contested fairly, though he did not elaborate further. Trump made the claim after first suggesting that the Democrats had fixed their primary system so Clinton could defeat Sen. Bernie Sanders. He repeated the charge Monday night on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity,\" saying: \"November 8th, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.\" Speaking at a stop Monday night in Pennsylvania, Trump did not mince words as he also blasted Sanders for backing Clinton. \u201cIf he would have just not done anything, go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero. But he made a deal with the devil. She's the devil. He made a deal with the devil. It's true,\u201d Trump said. So far, Clinton has not responded directly to Trump\u2019s latest jabs. She\u2019s focusing her fire on Trump\u2019s controversial comments about\u00a0 Khizr and Ghazala Khan -- Muslims whose U.S. Army captain son was killed in Iraq in 2004 -- and Trump\u2019s business record. \"For the life of me I don't know why someone runs to be president of the United States who thinks and says we don't win anymore, our country is full of losers,\u201d Clinton said Monday in Nebraska. The Khans spoke out against Trump and questioned his familiarity with the Constitution last week at the Democratic National Convention. Trump struck back by questioning whether Ghazala Khan had been allowed to speak. She said she is still too grief-stricken by her son's death. Trump has since faced bipartisan criticism for his comments. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign put out a statement late Monday alleging Clinton Foundation ties to a corporation \u201cfunding\u201d ISIS. The campaign detailed financial contributions the Clinton Foundation received from a cement-making company called Lafarge. The same statement cited reporting in French media outlets that the company had entered deals with the Islamic State and other armed groups in Syria to protect its interests there. \u201cMore than any major presidential nominee\u00a0in modern history, Hillary Clinton is tied to brutal theocratic\u00a0and Islamist regimes. Now we learn she has accepted money from a company linked to ISIS,\u201d Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement. Fox News\u2019 Kristin Fisher and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2013 A divided U.S. Supreme Court refused Wednesday to reinstate North Carolina's voter identification requirement and keep just 10 days of early in-person voting. The decision \u2014 a victory for voting rights groups and President Barack Obama's Justice Department \u2014 means voters won't have to show one of several qualifying photo IDs when casting ballots in the presidential battleground state. Early voting also reverts to 17 days, to begin Oct. 20. The court rejected a request by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and other state officials to delay a lower court ruling that found the state law was tainted by racial discrimination. \"Hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians will now be able to vote without barriers,\" Allison Riggs, an attorney representing some of the groups and voters who originally sued over the 2013 law, said in a release. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down several parts of the law July 29, saying they were approved by Republican legislators in 2013 with intentional bias against black voters. Lawyers for McCrory and the state officials disagreed with the 4th Circuit ruling that there was \"discriminatory intent\" in passing the law and wanted a delay while they drafted an appeal. The high court divided 4-4 on most of the challenged provisions, with the four more conservative justices supporting the state's bid to enforce them in the upcoming election. The split illustrates again how closely divided the Supreme Court is on voting rights and how the outcome of the presidential election essentially will determine the court's direction. The court has been operating with only eight members since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. A ninth justice chosen by Democrat Hillary Clinton would almost certainly vote with the court's liberal justices on this issue. A justice picked by Republican Donald Trump would likely be a majority-making fifth vote for conservatives. McCrory, who signed the law, said in a statement that North Carolina \"has been denied basic voting rights\" by the decision and that \"four liberal justices\" had \"blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws.\" The voting adjustments could benefit Democrats in the November election, since registered Democrats historically have favored using early voting. Evidence presented during the trial over the 2013 law says black residents disproportionately lack photo ID. Black voters traditionally have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in North Carolina. Attorneys who sued over the law \u2014 representing the U.S. government, the state NAACP, other groups and voters \u2014 told the justices last week keeping voter ID and 10 days of early voting in place would irreparably harm minority voters. About 900,000 people voted in North Carolina in the first week of a 17-day early voting period in the 2012 presidential election. Fifty-six percent of state voters in that election cast early in-person ballots. State NAACP president Rev. William Barber declared the ruling \"another major victory for justice\" that allows people to vote without \"expansive restrictions by racist politicians or racist policies.\" Voter ID was required during primary elections this year and 10 days of early voting had been in place since 2014. McCrory and Republican legislative leaders have said voter ID is a sound requirement to increase the integrity of elections. Appeals court judges said the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The law was amended last year to include a method for people unable to get a photo ID to still vote. Republican House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger said in a statement they were disappointed in the ruling and pointed out more than 30 other states have a voter ID requirement. \"We'll continue to fight to restore this commonsense measure,\" Moore tweeted. A trial court judge in April had upheld the law, but the 4th Circuit panel wrote he seemed \"to have missed the forest in carefully surveying the many trees\" by failing to recognize a link between race and politics in North Carolina. The challenged provisions \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision,\" said the 4th Circuit ruling, which also struck down provisions eliminating same-day registration during the early voting period and the counting of Election Day ballots cast by a person outside of their home precinct. The state didn't ask the Supreme Court to restore these provisions. The court's action also means a voting \"preregistration\" program that readies 16- and 17-year-olds to cast ballots when they turn 18 is re-instituted. The 2013 law had ended the program. Since the 4th Circuit decision, some GOP-controlled county election boards have approved 17-day early voting schedules that scale back the number of voting hours or anticipated early-vote sites. The State Board of Elections will decide whether they stand.",

            "article_content": "A homemade gun allegedly exchanged in a gun buyback program. (Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus) A Minneapolis gun buyback program targeting weapons used in street crimes may be shooting blanks, as detractors said a Saturday collection mostly took in antiquated, unused or homemade arms from legal owners and did little to thin the firearm supply actually available to dangerous criminals. Two Minneapolis locations collected about 150 firearms Saturday, but both exchanges were forced to shut down several hours early when officials ran out of Visa gift cards \u2013 $25,000 worth, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. And at least some of that money helped finance the purchase of even more guns. One anonymous gun owner told WCCO he received $200 in gift cards that he planned to use to buy a new firearm. That man said he didn\u2019t think the program was serving its intended purpose. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel that a criminal is going to come up to a fire department with a bunch of police around it and turn in a gun,\u201d he said. Paul Joat, an area gun collector, told The Star Tribune he bought two weapons on the street, ostensibly offering the sellers a better deal than the city could. \u201cA lot of what I\u2019m seeing is gun nuts turning in their guns for more than they\u2019re worth,\u201d he said. A commenter on the Minnesota Gun Talk message board noted that \u201cevery single person in line was one of us.\u201d The lure of a Visa gift card worth between $15 and $300 was enough to make some enterprising Minnesotans get creative. One person constructed a \u201cshotgun\u201d out of a piece of wood, some tape and a pipe. They were given a $100 gift card for the contraption, according to a Facebook post from the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus. Guns gathered during the Saturday buyback were set to be decommissioned and used in an art piece.",

            "article_content": "All-Star panel reaction to the third and final presidential debate Donald Trump on Wednesday night didn\u2019t threaten to prosecute his opponent should he win the presidency on Nov. 8. Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t spout off any obviously canned phrases for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d to mock. But there were still plenty of fireworks during the third -- and final -- presidential debate of 2016. Here are the night\u2019s top nine moments: 1. \u201cBad hombres\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, raised eyebrows during his response to a question about border security. The content of his answer wasn\u2019t surprising for anyone who\u2019s listened to Trump since he began his run for the White House -- build a wall and deport the \u201cbad, bad people in this country.\u201d But near the end of the remarks, Trump suddenly used a slang Spanish word for \u201cmen.\u201d \u201cWe have some bad hombres here and we\u2019re gonna get them out,\u201d Trump said. Social media immediately lit up with reactions, and \u201cBad Hombres\u201d was one of the top Twitter trends within minutes. The phrase had been tweeted out nearly 130,000 times by the time the debate ended. Even Clinton\u2019s digital team quickly jumped on the phrase, tweeting out \u201cHombres\u201d? #debatenight 2. \u201cOpen Borders\u201d Moderator Chris Wallace pressed Clinton on a controversial remark she made during a paid speech to a Brazilian bank shortly after she ended her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton has resisted releasing the transcripts of her so-called \u201cWall Street speeches\u201d despite pressure from her primary and general election opponents. Some of the transcripts, however, recently leaked out when WikiLeaks published a trove of stolen emails allegedly belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. \u201cWe've learned from WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, \u2018my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders,\u2019\u201d Wallace asked. Trump immediately leaned into his microphone and said \u201cThank you.\u201d Clinton said the line had been misconstrued. She said she was talking about \u201cenergy\u201d coming across borders, not illegal immigration. Trump rolled his eyes and smirked at the explanation. 3. Vladimir Putin After the topics of WikiLeaks and the Podesta hack were broached, the discussion turned toward Russia, the nation many intelligence experts believe was behind the Podesta hacking. Clinton attacked Trump for being too cozy with Russian president Vladimir Putin and said Trump would be Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet as president.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cNo puppet, no puppet. You\u2019re the puppet.\u201d After some crosstalk, Trump continued to counterpunch. \u201cShe doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her every step of the way,\u201d he said. 4. Abortion and The Supreme Court The next president might appoint as many as three Supreme Court justices, Wallace noted, a number that could influence whether the court leans left or right for an entire generation. The hot-button topic of abortion was discussed in this context, with Clinton unable to answer if she could ever support any regulation on the controversial procedure. Trump responded with one of the most passionate -- and graphic -- answers he\u2019d given during any debate. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.\u201d 5. Sexual misconduct allegations Since lewd comments Trump made on a hot mic in 2005 were revealed two weeks ago, several women have come forward with claims that Trump sexually assaulted them. Trump denied all of the charges and accused Clinton \u201cand her very sleazy campaign\u201d of being behind the stories. \u201cWell, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThose people, I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.\u201d Clinton responded: \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\u201d 6. Violence at rallies Clinton lambasted Trump for being responsible for the rhetoric that she said provoked several violent incidents during his primary and general election rallies. \u201cThis is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies,\u201d Clinton said. Trump, however, said it was Clinton who was guilty of starting the unrest. He cited an edited, undercover video released this week by a conservative activist. The footage allegedly shows Democrat operatives discussing how they have incited violence at Trump rallies. \u201cSo sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt's on tape.\u201d 7. Clinton Foundation vs. Trump Foundation Clinton and Trump traded shots about their respective namesake charity foundations, both of which have come under fire for various scandals. When Clinton initially said she was \u201cthrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Trump saw an opening. \u201cIt's a criminal enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia giving 25 million dollars. Qatar, all of these companies. You talk about women and women's rights. So these are people that push gays off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. So I'd like to ask you right now why don't you give back the money that you have taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money?\u201d Clinton retorted: \u201cAnd I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI mean, who does that?\u201d 8. Trump may not accept election results Though he said during the first presidential debate that he would accept the results of November\u2019s election whether he won or lost, Trump on Wednesday said he wasn\u2019t so sure anymore. Trump has been frequently talking during rallies about his belief that the election is \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d he said Wednesday night. \u201cI'm not looking at anything now I will look at it at the time. What I've seen is so bad.\u201d Trump also said Clinton shouldn\u2019t be eligible to run for the presidency because of her secret server scandal. Though authorities said Clinton was careless, after a lengthy investigation the FBI declined to charge her. \u201cShe's guilty of a very, very serious crime,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe should not be allowed to run...What I'm saying now is I will tell you. I will keep you in suspense, okay?\u201d 9. Rigged Following up on Trump\u2019s talk of a \u201crigged\u201d election, Clinton said the rhetoric was not only untrue, but also a tool commonly employed by the billionaire businessman. \u201cEvery time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is is rigged against him,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case. He said that the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus; he lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering. He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.\u201d After hearing Clinton\u2019s comment about the Emmy\u2019s, Trump interrupted: \u201cI should have gotten it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "SCOTUS expected to decide on high-profile cases as term comes to a close The Supreme Court is set this week to begin announcing decisions on roughly a dozen remaining cases, including contentious ones on abortion and immigration. The rulings will be released from the bench starting Monday, with the high court typically waiting until the last week of June to announce those on the most contentious issues, in a tradition known as \"spring flood\" and just before the justices go on summer recess. Rulings on this season\u2019s slate of cases were complicated by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia -- leaving the bench with four remaining conservative justices and four liberal ones. \"Eight, as you know, is not a good number for a multi-member court,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recent said. \"That means no opinions and no precedential value; an equal division is essentially the same as a denial of review.\" Such ties mean a default victory for the party that won at the lower court, but only in states covered by that appeals court's jurisdiction. The lack of precedent leaves legal uncertainty nationwide. And the high court could re-argue the case when it operates at full strength with nine members. The court has already deadlocked twice this term, and essentially punted in another high profile case. A challenge by religious-affiliated employers -- including a Catholic charity of nuns --\u00a0to ObamaCare's contraception mandate was sent back to the lower courts. \"The Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\" the unsigned ruling read. The outcome suggested the court lacked a majority for a significant ruling and that it could be a template for other divided cases to be resolved in the coming days. On a pending ruling regarding abortion-clinic restrictions in Texas, Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, see a possible 4-4 decision but thinks the case will come before the court again, in perhaps a year or two. However, some progressives hope the court's so-called \"swing vote\" will break with his conservative colleagues. \"I think all eyes are going to be on Justice [Anthony] Kennedy and I don't think it will split 4-4,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"I think Justice Kennedy will join the more liberal justices to say the Supreme Court has reaffirmed there is a constitutional right for a woman to choose whether or not to have an abortion.\" Both court watchers spoke Sunday to Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent Shannon Bream, on \"America's Election Headquarters.\" Scalia\u2019s unexpected death in February, during a presidential election year, left the court shaken and short-handed, a situation Ginsburg noted wistfully. \"The Court is a paler place without him,\" she said of her best friend on the court. President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland as a replacement, but Senate Republican leaders have vowed that the federal appeals court judge will not get a hearing or floor vote this year. That would leave his successor with an immediate opportunity to shift the court's shaky ideological balance to either the right or left. While public debate over the direction of the nation's highest court continues to animate the presidential race, the court remains notoriously tight-lipped on internal discussions. Still, Chief Justice John Roberts last month told a group of judges he and his colleagues were operating under a new dynamic. \"I try to achieve as much consensus as I can,\" Roberts said. \"We kind of have to have a commitment as a group. I think we spend a fair amount of time-- maybe a little more than others in the past-- talking about things, talking them out. It sometimes brings you a bit closer together.\" Another consequence of the current vacancy is that the court has accepted fewer cases for full review, meaning its fall docket is so far pretty thin. Under court rules, it takes at least four justices to put a case on the argument calendar, and five to ultimately prevail on the merits. But Roberts said a go-slow approach often is best long term. \"I think we should be as restrained in when we decide the issues when it's necessary to do so,\" he said. \"I think that's part of how I look at the job.\" Among the cases yet to be decided: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION:\u00a0 Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. The case could be a definitive, landmark ruling on the use of race in public university admissions. Justice Elena Kagan has already recused, meaning conservatives might have a 4-3 edge to cut back on such policies. Or Kennedy could side with his more liberal colleagues to uphold the school's diversity model. The justices first heard the case three years ago but essentially sidestepped a binding resolution. The court at the time affirmed the use of race in the admissions process but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity. The 7-1 decision avoided the larger constitutional issues. ABORTION ACCESS: Whole Woman's Health v. Cole. The constitutionality of a Texas law requires all clinics performing abortions in the state to be \"ambulatory surgical centers\" and that doctors performing abortions first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority Legislature have said the regulations contained in the 2013 law -- known as H.B. 1 --\u00a0would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups argue the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. Only 10 such health centers would qualify to stay open, and large areas west and south of San Antonio would have no full-time abortion providers. EXECUTIVE POWER:\u00a0 U.S. v. Texas. The case is a multi-state challenge to the president's use of executive power to block certain undocumented aliens from being deported, despite being in the country illegally.\u00a0 A tie decision would essentially be a win for the states, since the lower courts have put the president's programs on hold. At issue is whether as many as 4 million immigrants can be spared deportation -- including many who entered the U.S. illegally as children, or those who are parents of citizens or legal residents. The president's programs -- known as the Deferred Action for Parents of American Citizens and Permanent Residents (DAPA) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) -- effectively went around the Republican-led Congress. Opponents -- including 26 states and GOP members of Congress -- say the White House's broad immigration policy plan exceeds constitutional power. PUBLIC CORRUPTION: McDonnell v. U.S. The case addresses the definition of \"official acts\" that can lead to being prosecuted for public corruption. Virginia's former GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell was convicted of providing favors to a friend and benefactor. In oral arguments from April, a majority of justices appeared poised to void McDonnell's conviction and place new limits on the reach of federal bribery laws. Several on the court, across the ideological spectrum, expressed major concerns that the laws give prosecutors too much power to criminalize the everyday acts that politician perform to help constituents. SEARCH AND SEIZURE: Birchfield v. North Dakota;\u00a0 Bernard v. Minnesota;\u00a0 Beylund v. Levi. The justices are considering the constitutionality of warrantless roadside drunk-driving tests and of assumed consent to such tests. The high court also expressed doubts in oral arguments about laws in at least a dozen states. Drivers prosecuted under those provisions claim they violate the Constitution's 4th Amendment protections. Some states suggested it would be too burdensome in many instances to seek an expedited search warrant every time.",

            "article_content": "FILE -- July 5, 2016: President Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton walk down the steps of Air Force One after arriving at North Carolina Air National Guard Base in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) There are three simple facts about Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy that should not be disputable \u2014 even by supporters of Donald Trump. There are undisputed facts about Trump as well \u2014 that he has used bigoted words about Mexicans, questioned the integrity of a federal judge because of his Mexican heritage, mocked a disabled reporter, used misogynistic words while bragging on tape about conduct that is the functional equivalent of criminal sexual assault and recommended the spread of nuclear weapons \u2014 but these are for another column. First, Hillary Clinton has spent her life involved in public service and has a public record and voting record that is progressive. I first met Hillary at Yale when I was in my third year at Yale Law School in September 1969, and she was an incoming first-year student. I was standing in line to register for classes, and I turned around and saw her right behind me. I recognized her from her photo in a national news magazine that I had seen the night before about a highly regarded speech she had given at her Wellesley College commencement the previous June. I introduced myself and asked her whether there was any advice I could offer her about Yale Law School \u2014 what courses to take, what professors were best, how to read cases and study, etc. Her response: \u201cYou could help me \u2014 where is the nearest legal services clinic that I could volunteer for?\u201d When I questioned whether she would have the time, she responded: \u201cThe reason I came to law school is to help me do public service.\u201d Wow, I thought. This person is unusual \u2014 she is going places. The more I got to know her that year, the more I thought she would someday be president. I kid you not. Hillary\u2019s life\u2019s work has been devoted to public service and helping others, especially helping children and healthcare policy \u2014 that is a fact. Through the years as first lady of Arkansas and in the White House, as well as her eight years in the U.S. Senate, her position on all the major issues has been as a progressive Democrat with a reputation of working well with Republicans. Her one mistake \u2014 shared by 26 other progressive U.S. Democratic senators and many others \u2014 was supporting the Iraq War resolution in October 2003. She has since said she made a mistake - as she also said she made a mistake and apologized for using a server for her emails while Secretary of State. \u00a0This contrasts with Trump, who never admits to a mistake even when he challenged the sincerity of a Gold Star Muslim mother. Fact two is Hillary\u2019s unquestioned superior experience and qualifications to be president. As President Obama said at the Democratic National Convention and has reiterated many times since then, there is no one who has ever \u2014 ever \u2014 been as qualified to be president of the United States in the history of our country, and he included himself and President Clinton on that list. Trump says his lack of experience in government and his experience as a businessman \u2014 including bankrupting four companies in two years \u2014 is an advantage. Fact three is her compassion and empathy for those who are less fortunate than she. Hillary is a person who has spent her life helping children, the poor, those less fortunate, and those who are the object of discrimination suffering an absence of equal opportunity. In other words, she meets the definition of a moral leader eloquently defined by former Senator and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey: \u201cIt was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.\u201d That is the Hillary Clinton I have known for 47 years. That is the Hillary Clinton who I know \u2014 who I am certain \u2014 will make a great president of the United States.",

            "article_content": "Black Lives Matter protesters laid siege to a number of cities over the weekend including my hometown: Memphis, Tennessee. They shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River -- stranding thousands of motorists for hours -- in sweltering heat. Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for conservatives! Blocking a roadway is a crime under Tennessee law. Yet Memphis police officers were told to stand down and allow the agitators to block the Hernando-Desoto Bridge. They used to call that kind of behavior aiding and abetting. Not a single person was arrested. (Fox 13 Memphis) Police say it was a peaceful protest. But photographs taken from the bridge showed a very different situation. In one instance, young men climbed atop a tractor-trailer- raising their fists in defiance. I wonder if the driver of that tractor-trailer thought it was a peaceful demonstration? Television station WMC reported that protesters even blocked a car trying to escort a child to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Apparently that child's life did not matter to the protesters. The car was eventually allowed to pass -- but only after police intervened. Click here to get Todd\u2019s best-selling book \u2013 an in-depth primer on how to restore traditional American values! We have no idea how many emergency responses were hampered by the gridlock created by the BLM crowd. We have no idea how many people missed family events or missed work because they were trapped on the interstate. In St. Paul, Minnesota, at least 21 police officers were injured during a \"full-scale riot\" on Interstate 94, according to the Star-Tribune. Violent thugs hurled rocks, concrete and rebar at officers as they protested the killing of Philando Castile. One of those officers suffered a broken vertebra after someone dropped a concrete block on his head. Could someone explain to me how fracturing a police officer's spine and preventing a child from getting to the hospital advances the Black Lives Matter agenda? The police-involved shootings in Baton Rouge and Minnesota were terrible tragedies. If investigators determine the officers broke they law -- they should and must be brought to justice. But both shootings are still under investigation -- so to be honest -- no one knows for certain what happened. Yet, the mainstream media, the Obama administration and the professional race agitators have once again rushed to judgment -- just like they did in Ferguson, Missouri. They never let a crisis go to waste, do they? It feels like our nation has been sucker-punched. You can see it on people's faces. Sorrow. Frustration. Anger. Helplessness. I understand that frustration -- but it does not give us a license to disobey the law. Peaceful protesting is one thing. Domestic terrorism is another. Instead of turning a blind eye, the Memphis Police Department should've sealed off both ends of the bridge and arrested every single person not in a vehicle. But that's not what happened. The rule of law matters -- without it -- we've got anarchy.",

            "article_content": "The Libertarian nominees explain what they would do differently from the Republicans and Democrats The Libertarian Party ticket, facing what polls show are two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern American history, is seeing a bump in support as the general election race moves into full swing \u2013 and a surge in interest that could carry nominee Gary Johnson onto the prized debate stage this fall. Despite Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularity issues and trust gap with voters, few expect the Libertarian ticket to pose a Ross Perot-style threat this year. But the party is far more than a political curiosity in 2016. Rumors are swirling in the wake of the major-party conventions that high-profile Republicans are now considering backing the ticket; a recent video from Johnson and running mate William Weld generated considerable buzz; and the polls show Johnson getting close to 15 percent \u2013 the threshold he needs to reach to land him on the debate stage with Trump and Clinton this fall. The RealClearPolitics average has Johnson at 8.4 percent in a four-way race with Trump, Clinton and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, up from 4.5 percent in June. The latest Fox News poll released Wednesday, after the conventions, put Johnson at 12 percent. An NBC poll taken toward the end of the Democratic convention put Johnson at 9 percent, roughly where he was in prior polling. Party officials said the unpopularity of the Republican and Democratic candidates gives the party an \u201cunprecedented opportunity.\u201d \u201cIt goes from week to week and day to day watching for what new thing [Clinton and Trump are] going to do to become more unpopular with the American people, and frighten people,\u201d Nicholas Sarwark, chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThose candidates are the gift that keeps on giving. We\u2019re running as the qualified adult in the room.\u201d Sarwark pointed to Johnson\u2019s record as a two-term New Mexico governor, \u201cre-elected as a Republican in a Democratic state,\u201d in touting his credentials and appeal. Unclear is whether the support in the polls will translate into support at the ballot box. In 2012, Johnson won just 0.99 percent of all votes cast -- making him the most successful White House candidate in Libertarian history, but not making much of a dent in the race as a whole. But this year, there are plenty of signs more voters are seeking an alternative candidate. At the Democratic convention last week, many Bernie Sanders supporters were getting on board with the Green Party\u2019s Stein. But so far, Johnson is polling the best among third-party candidates. He and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Weld, generated some buzz before the conventions with a slick video ad listing their accomplishments. Are #youin? Check out our new video -- and spread it around. #election2016 #TeamGov pic.twitter.com/9X6iNNzZW2 \u201cWe\u2019ve been there ... And done that!\u201d the candidates say. Johnson said in an interview Monday with the Los Angeles Times that he believes in addition to appealing to disenfranchised Republicans on issues like free trade, low taxes and smaller government, the Libertarian stance on social issues and foreign policy could bring Sanders voters on board. Sarwark said the party is banking that while Trump and Clinton are about as well-known as they are going to be, Johnson still can introduce himself to voters not familiar with his story \u2013 especially if he is able to get on the debate stage. This is far from a foregone conclusion. So far, while Johnson\u2019s support is higher than in past years, an 8.4 percent average is still a distance from the 15 percent he\u2019d need to make the debates. He has until the middle of September to hit 15 percent in not just one poll but an average of five recent polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates. \u201cPolitically, where we stand, is we have to get into those presidential debates to really stand a chance,\u201d Weld told The Wall Street Journal last week. \u201cIf we catch a break or two, we may get there.\u201d Even then, the record for third-party or independent candidates is not strong. In recent political history, the one who came closest to the presidency was businessman Perot in 1992 \u2013 who was an independent, not technically a third-party candidate. At one point, Perot was leading in some polls against then-President George H. W. Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. However, after dropping out of the race before re-entering, he lost support. He eventually garnered 19 percent of the vote, with some Republicans arguing he split the GOP vote and handed the election to Clinton. Republicans, meanwhile, were arguably given a boost by Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, when Nader picked up 2.7 percent of the vote against Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush. Johnson\u2019s potential impact is hard to gauge. The latest Fox News poll found Johnson siphoning support about equally from the Democratic and GOP candidates. But he could get a boost in the coming weeks as some Republicans reportedly consider backing him. Most notably, 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush reportedly are mulling endorsements for Johnson. Marvin Bush, youngest brother of Jeb and George W., also endorsed Johnson last week. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard from the Bush and Romney camps, they\u2019re still considering it,\u201d Sarwark claimed. Asked if the party is looking just to make a strong showing, or go all the way, Sarward was bullish: \u201cThere\u2019s a path to the presidency. The ground is there.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Akron, Ohio, Monday, Aug. 22, 2016. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) I\u2019m a woman, a racial minority, and an immigrant, and I grew up in inner-city America. I have two university degrees, one from Cornell University and another from Stanford Law School. I have worked for some of the most elite institutions in America, including a foreign policy organization that counts Chelsea and Bill Clinton among its members. According to conventional wisdom, I have no business being a Trump supporter. Yet I have been an unabashed fan since Trump declared his candidacy for president. In fact, never in my life have I been this excited about a presidential nominee. Strangers and friends alike have wondered how a highly educated Chinese-American woman could possibly support a man widely condemned as racist, sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and Islamophobic. It is not that complicated, really. I like the candidate and what he stands for, and I reject the caricature propagated by the mainstream media and his opponents. I believe this country needs bold change, not more of the same. Trump has promised to deliver. Instinctively, I recognize in Trump the key ingredients that have made success possible in my own life. As a child of the ghetto, I succeeded in extracting myself\u2014and my family\u2014from urban dysfunction and decay not just because I worked hard but because I dreamt big, took risks no one I knew would take, and kept faith in America\u2019s promise. Trump\u2019s story is wildly more successful and dramatic, but it resonates with me nonetheless. Since he declared his candidacy\u00a0 he has defied the odds, upended the political order, and dared to envision a completely different America. Certainly, he is a very flawed candidate. Recently released audio of a private conversation Trump had 11 years ago confirms him to be vulgar, narcissistic, and insecure. Before that, his endless controversies on the campaign trail revealed a man who was thin-skinned, undisciplined, and immature. Yet I believe this same man will overthrow\u2014not just tinker with\u2014the wretched political correctness that governs this country\u2019s discussions and policies about race, ethnicity, gender, and other immutable characteristics. He will fight for Americans in a way that Republicans and Democrats have long been afraid to do, and he will think big, act boldly, and choose common sense over ingrained practices. Here's why. Political Correctness I am a natural for Trump\u2019s core constituency: I have long been a card-carrying member of what Hillary Clinton calls the \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d I am \u201cdeplorable\u201d because I reject the reigning politically correct and intellectually intolerant paradigm, which mandates that women and minorities serve as tokens of diversity according to their so-called racial and gender identity. In this paradigm, I am \"deplorable\" because I dare to have a dissenting opinion. Long before Trump became a presidential contender, my support for the rule of law and opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants made me a xenophobe. My references to black-on-black crime in discussions about police-community relations made me a racist. My use of the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d made me an Islamophobe. When Trump came along, he gave me\u2014and millions others\u2014a voice. Not only does he reject this nonsense wholesale, he does so with hilarity, theater, and bombast. His undisciplined outbursts are not always pretty, but he is an equal-opportunity offender, not a stooge of the prevailing bigotry or an apologist for its fake diversity and ill-disguised pandering. Next to Trump, the Republican governing class\u2019s rejection of political correctness is merely a mealy-mouthed exercise. Over the summer, we saw the squeamishness of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.). When asked for his views on the Black Lives Matter movement, whose protestors have repeatedly called for police officers to be killed or\u00a0fried\u00a0\u201clike bacon,\u201d Ryan demurred. This is the same man who never misses an opportunity to call Trump racist and divisive. He recently announced that he will no longer campaign with or defend his party\u2019s presidential nominee. For a long time, I supported Republicans like Ryan and others who are far worse, but this year, I have a better choice. This year, my candidate does not try to ingratiate himself to the mainstream media. Instead, he slashes through the fabric of political correctness and threatens to tear down its reign. This is the type of candidate I have wanted for a long, long time. He'll Fight for Us Beyond Trump\u2019s politically incorrect rhetoric, he has demonstrated time and again that he will fight for those of us who have put our faith in him. I first noticed him when he spoke of illegal immigration and emphasized building a wall to secure our borders. He did not describe all Mexican immigrants as rapists or criminals, but it did not matter. His critics cried racism and xenophobia anyway. Yet the more they became indignant, the more I supported Trump. I am a first-generation immigration. My family came to the United States legally\u2014we submitted the relevant documentation, answered the necessary questions, waited in line for years, and followed America\u2019s laws. Yet our respect for America\u2019s rule of law is entirely irrelevant to Democrats, who are eager to hand out citizenship to illegal immigrants for political gain. Republicans, on the other hand, pretend they care about legality and sovereignty but can hardly hide their disdain for making the tough decisions required to protect both. In fact, prominent Republicans\u2014ranging from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to Speaker Ryan\u2014have proudly called for one form of amnesty or another. By contrast, Trump has little use for their rhetoric or hypocrisy. He wants to build a wall and boasts of making Mexico pay for it. It makes no difference if the latter does not materialize. Far more important is Trump\u2019s willingness\u2014and even eagerness\u2014to taunt the political class by making this promise the centerpiece of his campaign. As he has enunciated his positions on other issues, begat more indignation, and stood firm, I have supported him more forcefully. For instance, on the crucial issue of defeating terrorism and keeping the homeland safe, he has called for a ban of Muslims from terror-prone countries and for conducting extreme ideological vetting of immigrants who wish to enter this country. The response from the media and the political establishment has been loud and furious, but Trump has pressed on regardless. His proposal can certainly be fleshed out further, but it is far more sensible than the reluctance by President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to identify radical Islamic terrorism by name, or the delusion by many on the Right who think radical Islam can be cleanly and clearly separated from peaceful Islam at all times. Trump has repeatedly incurred the wrath of the political establishment, and in the process, he showed voters like me a candidate who refuses to back down and is not afraid to fight for Americans whose wishes have been long ignored. Trump Has Big Ideas and Common Sense Despite all that I like about Trump, I have found his rhetoric and positions on trade to be most difficult to swallow. I have been an ardent free trader my entire adult life. Trump, however, has called for renegotiating America\u2019s major trade agreements, such as NAFTA, and for slapping heavy tariffs on U.S. trading partners (35 percent on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on imports from China). I do not support these positions, but I understand their appeal far better than most free traders who write and talk for a living. I hail from a working class family. Some years ago, when my parents were laid off from their blue-collar jobs, I had to make a choice myself: I declined a job that I worked very hard to get and accepted one that I hated because the latter offered significantly better compensation. I believed it to be the right decision for my family; it was not. Nevertheless, my faith in free trade and free markets remains, but that faith is tempered by intimate knowledge of real Americans who have lost out in amid powerful global forces. Few politicians have bothered to speak for them; even fewer have offered viable solutions to alleviate their pain. Today, Trump is speaking for them, with gusto. While many of his pronouncements are outlandish, he is staking out opening bids to negotiations with foreign countries and Congress. The details of his positions on trade, much like his positions on the economy (consolidating five individual income tax brackets into three), immigration (making Mexico pay for the wall), and foreign policy (requiring that NATO allies pay more for collective security), are not firmly set in stone, even if the broad directions of policy have been decided. Trump has made clear that much of what he threatens is exactly that: threats that will be used to extract better deals for America. His ideas may not pan out quite as they were originally described, but his goal is to think differently, to envision better arrangements for this country in general. Unlike a typical politician, Trump is not going to confine himself to the solutions that have not worked in the past. To Americans who want a better deal for their families and their country, that is very much worth applauding. Trump Is Leading a Political Revolution I believe this country needs bold change, not more of the same. Trump has promised to deliver. Citizens across this country have placed their faith in this revolutionary candidate, despite his flaws. Hillary Clinton may think we are deplorable, but we are ordinary Americans who believe the country deserves better than business as usual. In this election, we have proudly joined the political revolution that Trump has inspired, and we are not asking Hillary, or anyone else, for permission.",

            "article_content": "Gregg Jarrett weighs in Americans who lived through the nightmares of both the Watergate and Lewinsky scandals recall vividly how every day seemed to produce new evidence of wrongdoing. The drip, drip of deceptions and lies finally overflowed into a cascading pool of criminality and disgust. The first scandal culminated in Articles of Impeachment.\u00a0 The other an impeachment trial.\u00a0 Is America now hurtling toward the same political abyss? It looks like it. So, fasten your seat belts and brace for impact. Sources tell Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier that the FBI has uncovered an \u201cavalanche of evidence\u201d in the Clinton Foundation investigation. Agents are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case,\u201d calling it a \u201cvery high priority.\u201d Armed with newly discovered email evidence and additional documents revealed by WikiLeaks, these sources say that agents will likely try to get Huma Abedin and others to cooperate in an effort to bring criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. It is a stunning development. But that\u2019s how avalanches happen. Suddenly, you\u2019re buried before you know it. If this is true, and if Clinton is elected president in a few days but thereafter indicted, several scenarios could unfold. She could resign before or after inauguration, leaving President Tim Kaine sitting behind a desk in the Oval Office. President Obama could pardon her before he departs that same office. Clinton, as president, could try to invoke broad constitutional immunity from prosecution, delaying her criminal trial until after she leaves office.\u00a0 Or she could pardon herself. However, all of that may not matter much if a Republican House of Representatives moves to impeach her. Neither immunity nor pardons apply to the ultimate constitutional remedy of impeachment. Thus, Americans will again be forced to suffer through another impeachment horror show. But Hillary may not be able to beat the rap the way her husband did back in 1999 when he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. What began as an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents\u2026 has now morphed into suspicions of rampant corruption involving Clinton\u2019s charity. Specifically, that she used her position as Secretary of State to confer benefits to donors who lavished money on her foundation and personally enriched the Clintons. \u00a0And the case against her is accelerating. It was inevitable, I suppose, that her emails would intersect somehow with the incredible wealth amassed by the Clintons since they left the White House. There\u2019s always a paper trail. Or pesky emails. Or, in the case of Richard Nixon, those damnable tapes. Two Investigations Merge Hillary Clinton used her unauthorized, private email server not only to conduct State Department business involving thousands of classified documents, but it appears she also used the server for some of her foundation\u2019s communications. The FBI has devoted more than a year to investigating whether the Clintons illegally leveraged their foundation for personal gain -- that is into tens of millions of dollars in potential self-dealing and so-called \u201cpay-to-play\u201d. As I pointed out in a previous column, all of this, if proved, could constitute bribery, fraud, and illegal use of a non-profit charity which smacks of racketeering. What\u2019s that? Operating a criminal enterprise.\u00a0 It is often associated with organized crime.\u00a0 (See \u201cmafia\u201d)\u00a0 There is also the related matter of perjury.\u00a0 And obstruction of justice.\u00a0 The same charges that were leveled against Bill Clinton back in the day. Importantly, the newly discovered Weiner/Abedin electronic devices appear to contain email evidence relevant to both the classified documents case and the Clinton Foundation case. In addition, sources confirm that laptops belonging to Clinton\u2019s top aides, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, are now in the possession of the FBI and are being \u201cexploited for more evidence.\u201d The floodgates are open. While the foundation probe is now center stage, a reinvigorated look at whether Clinton mishandled classified documents has obviously been resurrected. It is possible that FBI Director Comey could reconsider his opinion of Clinton\u2019s legal \u201cintent\u201d under the Espionage Act and reverse himself in his recommendation on prosecuting Clinton.\u00a0 Sources say there is a 99 percent chance that up to 5 foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed Clinton\u2019s emails and stolen them, putting a lie to President Obama\u2019s claim that Clinton did not jeopardize national security. The Clinton Foundation As \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace pointed out in the final debate, \u201cemails show that donors got special access\u201d\u00a0 to Clinton while Secretary of State. While that is surely unseemly or improper, it is illegal only if Clinton used her position to confer a benefit in exchange for money. That is, if donors rewarded Clinton with cash. So, here is an example of what might be illegal.\u00a0 It has been reported that Clinton helped UBS avoid the IRS. Bill then got paid $ 1.5 million dollars and their foundation received a ten-fold increase in donations by the bank.\u00a0 If the money was a reward for Clinton\u2019s work on behalf of UBS, then that could be considered bribery under federal law. And racketeering. Another example: it has been reported that Clinton\u2019s state department approved billions of dollars in arms sales to several nations whose governments gave money to the Clinton Foundation.\u00a0 Again, if it can be proven there was a quid-pro-quo, it would be illegal. This is where the WikiLeaks hacked emails come into play.\u00a0 Messages show that charity official Doug Band, while raising money for the foundation, also steered millions of dollars to Bill Clinton. The cash came from foundation donors who had business before Hillary\u2019s state department.\u00a0 Band\u2019s emails, in which he brags about his prowess in funneling up to $66 million to Bill, make explicit how the Clintons appear to have used their foundation for personal profit. Organized crime and Illegal syndicates tend to use legitimate-looking businesses as a \u201cfront\u201d to try to fool law enforcement.\u00a0 Often, they devise a \u201cdual purpose\u201d company -- one which operates lawfully from the front door, but unlawfully out the backdoor. There is little doubt that the Clinton Foundation operated as a charity. But if there was a secondary, hidden purpose devoted to self-dealing and personal enrichment, and if the foundation was merely a conduit, then prosecution could be pursued under federal anti-corruption statutes. Did DOJ Obstruct The FBI? It\u2019s beginning to look that way. Even after Comey announced in July that he would not recommend prosecuting Clinton, the investigation into her foundation was still being actively pursued by some agents within the FBI. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department became angry over this and agents were told to \u201cstand down.\u201d\u00a0 Whether that happened is disputed. However, it appears that FBI agents wanted to examine emails on non-government laptops that were part of the Clinton classified documents case. They felt there might be evidence that the foundation was being used illegally by the Clintons, as noted above. But Justice Department prosecutors allegedly stopped them from doing it. Why? Was Justice protecting Clinton? Can we be assured that the renewed investigation of Clinton won\u2019t be obstructed by an attorney general with allegiances to both Hillary and Bill Clinton? Time For an Independent Counsel Given these reports of DOJ\u2019s interference, there are serious and legitimate doubts about the integrity of the government\u2019s ability to investigation Clinton. Attorney General Loretta Lynch was compromised from the beginning. She was first elevated to the position of U.S. Attorney by Bill Clinton. She met privately with him just days before a decision was made as to whether his wife would be prosecuted. As if that were not enough, Lynch\u2019s boss, President Obama, defended Clinton publicly last April on \"Fox News Sunday\" by declaring, in essence, she did not break the law. He made the same argument during an earlier \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.\u00a0 He prejudged the outcome of the case. This sent a pretty clear message to those in charge of just how the president wanted the question of prosecution to turn out.\u00a0 Now, it appears that Lynch\u2019s Department is heeding that message by actively obstructing the FBI\u2019s investigation. The attorney general has failed or refused to appoint a Special Prosecutor to ensure that these investigations are fair and impartial. President Obama could demand one, as well. He likely will not. His conflict of interest is as glaring as Lynch\u2019s. After all, the president has been campaigning vigorously for Clinton to succeed him. Why would he now jeopardize the chance of preserving or even burnishing his legacy? Donald Trump is vowing, if elected, to unwind much of what Mr. Obama has accomplished. Therefore, it is up to Congress to reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act to accomplish the same. It would direct the attorney general to petition the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to appoint one. No choice. Sadly, this may be the only way the public\u2019s trust can be restored.",

            "article_content": "Inmates wait for their video arraignments at the Saginaw County Jail, Friday, July 18, 2014. The Saginaw County Sheriff's Department has purchased new jumpsuits, with black and white stripes, for some of the inmates at the jail. (AP Photo/The Saginaw News/MLive.com, Jeff Schrier) (AP Photo/The Saginaw News/MLive.com, Jeff Schrier) Right now, more than two million people in the United States are behind bars. This is a human tragedy, but it is also a crisis with far-reaching consequences for communities across America. A recent White House report shows that the economic, social, and human costs of mass incarceration have never been higher. Beyond the staggering $270 billion that the U.S. spends on the criminal justice system annually, incarceration tears apart families, deepens poverty, and fuels mistrust of our vital public institutions. A problem this big clearly demands urgent action. For years now, we have waited for Congress to act or other branches of the federal government to take steps to reduce mass incarceration. Conventional wisdom says there is momentum for change and for significant bipartisan action on criminal justice reform. But progress toward meaningful reform at the national level has been agonizingly slow. Despite a growing chorus of voices for change across the aisle, Congress has failed to pass sentencing reform legislation or any other major improvements to our justice system this year. Jail time separates people\u2014most of whom haven\u2019t been convicted of a crime\u2014from their families, increases the likelihood of re-offense, reduces employment opportunities, and drains community resources that could be more productively invested. If we want to make a real impact in ending over-incarceration, we must look beyond Congress and the White House. Reforms at the local level\u2014where jails increasingly serve as a gateway to mass incarceration and recent progress shows that change is possible\u2014may offer the greatest opportunity to make a lasting impact. Local jails are largely missing from the national conversation about mass incarceration, but they are where the problem begins. Twelve million people are admitted to America\u2019s jails every year, almost 20 times as many as are to state and federal prisons. Jails are intended primarily to hold those who pose a flight risk or threat to public safety. Given our national over-reliance on incarceration, jails now warehouse thousands of people for nonviolent offenses, many solely because they are too poor to post bail. In New York City in 2012, for example, nearly a third of non-felony defendants confined to jail until their cases were resolved were being held on bails of less than $500. Astonishingly, three-quarters of people in jail are there for nonviolent traffic, drug, property or public order offenses. We need to ask ourselves if this is the best use of our public resources and our justice system. The misuse of jails contributes in many ways to our country\u2019s incarceration rate. Spending just two days in a local jail quadruples the chances that a person will ultimately land in a state or federal prison, according to research from the Arnold Foundation. Jail time separates people\u2014most of whom haven\u2019t been convicted of a crime\u2014from their families, increases the likelihood of re-offense, reduces employment opportunities, and drains community resources that could be more productively invested. It is no surprise that these issues take a heavier toll on some communities than others. Racial and ethnic disparities in jail populations can be found in local justice systems across the country. While African-Americans and Latinos make up 30 percent of Americans, they comprise 51 percent of the U.S. jail population. Many jails have become warehouses for people suffering from serious mental illness and substance abuse issues, largely because there are insufficient community-based services to meet their needs. Instead of making us safer, jail misuse negatively impacts public safety. Research shows that even people who are detained in jail for a relatively short stay before trial are more likely to be rearrested before their trial or commit a crime after completing their sentence. With annual spending on the building and running of jails currently four times what it was in the early 1980s, and the social cost immeasurably higher, we must ask ourselves: What are we paying for? Isn\u2019t there a better, more just and productive path? Encouraging efforts around the country show that there is. New Orleans, a city that once claimed the highest jail incarceration rate in the country, has cut its jail population by two-thirds in the last decade. By replacing the jail Hurricane Katrina destroyed with a much smaller jail and instituting pretrial risk assessment, New Orleans has demonstrated how local justice systems can promote better outcomes and increase fairness while ensuring public safety. And in New York City, Brooklyn\u2019s district attorney has made the bold decision to stop prosecuting most people arrested on low-level marijuana charges, helping keep many people out of jail who don\u2019t pose a safety or flight risk and protecting their ties to employment, family, and community. To spur innovations and effective reforms like these, the MacArthur Foundation, is supporting jurisdictions across the country as they work to create fairer, more effective local justice systems. Our hope is that their work, supported through our Safety and Justice Challenge, will provide successful models and inspire new solutions for ending the misuse of jails in the United States. As part of the initiative, 11 U.S. cities and counties\u2014including New Orleans and New York City\u2014recently announced efforts to create alternatives to incarceration and cut their jail populations by up to one-third. Just because Congress is failing to act does not mean everyone is. There is growing momentum behind bold reforms at the local level that can reduce over-incarceration in America. We have the opportunity to close the front door to this crisis\u2014and we cannot let it pass us by.",

CAN GOWDY DELIVER THE GOODS?Congressional hearings are usually a lot like dinner theater. Both the sustenance and the spectacle are damaged by their proximity. Nattering congressmen or senators trying to generate sound bites for the local news and fundraising emails ask impossibly ponderous questions with what they consider to be Perry Masonic flair. Instead, they end up sounding more like Monty Python, and get results about as good. Meanwhile, witnesses coached within an inch of their lives may drone or stammer, but they know to cling to the talking points for dear life. They may sweat through their shirts, but they don\u2019t make news. The House panel investigating the deadly Sept. 11, 2012 raid by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya \u2013 and the doctored talking points about it that flowed from the Obama administration \u2013 may fall into the same trap today. But there\u2019s a chance something of substance could emerge. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, will testify before the committee, and she will certainly be rehearsed and is definitely smart enough to avoid making news under normal circumstances. This is a woman who has taken and given more depositions in her life than most. And her fellow Democrats who sit on the committee will be ready to help her any way they can to delegitimize the hearing (to whatever degree that Kevin McCarthy did not already so do). But what could make this one different is that Chairman Trey Gowdy is not only better at this business than anyone in recent memory, he has also taken great pains to keep the six other Republicans on the panel from slobbering into the microphones. Insiders promise a disciplined, lawyerly probe from the former South Carolina prosecutor and his fellows. There may not be much shouting, they suggest, but they may make some news.

Sign up\u00a0here.** PRESENTING YOUR KEY COUNTIES FOR ELECTION DAY The national polls seem to have coalesced on the state of the race one day before the 2016 election ends: Democrat Hillary Clinton has the closing momentum and is ahead. But not by much. Clinton\u2019s lead of between 3 points and 4 points in an average of real polls is substantially better than President Obama\u2019s was four years ago when the national average put him about half a point better than Mitt Romney. Obama would go on to win by about 4 points. Political reporters and analysts laughed at the members of the Romney camp four years ago when they swore up and down that the polls were wrong and that the Massachusetts money maestro was actually ahead in their internal surveys and would slingshot past Obama when the voting was done. Campaigns always lie about their polling. It\u2019s like the heights and weights on a football roster: dishonesty is a matter of professional pride. Romney\u2019s team was just a little too emphatic about it. Har-de-har-har\u2026 Republican Donald Trump has mounted an assault against math and public opinion research like he was the VI Corps at Anzio. Trump, who once nuzzled and cooed over every primary poll that showed him in the lead, has rather changed his mind on the subject. But he\u2019s not entirely wrong. Polling is like shooting a shotgun \u2013 a blast pattern of data points spread over a small area to hit a moving target \u2013 not aiming a rifle at a target. Both candidates will likely do better than their current average polling vote shares of about 45 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Trump. Trump can still win. That would require, however, mobilizing an army of older white voters who he and his fellow Republicans believe will storm polling places on Tuesday to put Trump over the top. And if that\u2019s the case, we can\u2019t count on the polls alone. We need to go to where the voters are. With that in mind, come along for a tour of the counties that have among the best track records as bellwethers in their respective states. These are the places that where voters know how to pick \u2018em. Hillsborough County, Florida - The western anchor of the politically potent I-4 corridor, Hillsborough County and the Tampa suburbs were once a Republican stronghold with lots of older voters and military members. But an influx of Hispanic immigrants and younger voters has changed the game. John McCain and Mitt Romney only got about 46 percent of the vote in 2008 and 2012, losing the county on the way to statewide defeats. \u00a0 Merrimack County, New Hampshire - Merrimack County is slightly north of Manchester and what is increasingly becoming part of the greater Boston suburbs. It is the third most populous county in the state that, similar to the state overall, is trending more Democratic. In 2000, Al Gore won this county by a single point, but in 2004 John Kerry won here by 5 points, and President Obama won this county by double-digits in 2008 and 2012. Northampton County, Pennsylvania - Northampton County is located just north of Bucks County in the Philadelphia exurbs. Bethlehem Steel closed in 2003 and shattered the already feeble local economy. Democratic nominees won the county by 6 points in 2000 and just 1 point in 2004. In 2008, Obama won the county by 12 points in 2008 and 5 points in 2012. If Trump is really going to flip Pennsylvania, he\u2019ll do it with the help of lots of voters here. Washoe County, Nevada - The biggest little swing county in the world! Washoe, home to Reno, is the second most populous county in the state. That\u2019s in part due to the gambling and resort scene around Lake Tahoe but also a Hispanic population of about 22 percent and rising. Voters here went big for Bush in 2000, giving him a win by about 10 points but only 4 points four years later. Washoe was the same for Obama who won the county by 12 points but only 4 points in 2012. Fickle much? Jefferson County, Colorado - The county seat of Golden is home to Coors Brewing Company and the Colorado School of Mines, this county was one of the most dramatic political shifts between 2004 and 2008. Bush won this county by about 8 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Obama won here by 9 points in 2008. Although the gap narrowed slightly in 2012, Obama did win again by 5 points, showing that these voters are choosy about who they pick. Saginaw County, Michigan - Saginaw County is part of the Great Lakes Bay Area near Midland and Bay City. Located less than an hour north of Flint, Mich., this county experienced a major depopulation between 2000 and 2012. Similar to its metro area, this county has large black population \u2013 about 19 percent \u2013 but is also home to a lot of working class older white voters. Obama won big here in 2008 and 2012, but these are the kinds of places where Trump hopes to see the tide turn. Caswell County, North Carolina - This former mill town on the Virginia state line is a perfect reflection of North Carolina\u2019s shifting political trends. Romney won here by 2 points in 2012, Obama won by 3 points in 2008, Bush won by 4 points in 2004, and by 2 points in 2000. With a substantial African American population and lots of blue-collar white voters, this was once a Democratic bastion where Trump needs a big swing in his favor. Sandusky County, Ohio - Sandusky on the shore of Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland looks a lot like the rest of northern Ohio: overwhelmingly white, lots of older voters and decades of economic disruption in the rearview mirror. One of the reasons Trump is doing so well in the state is that counties like this one went against type in 2008 and 2012 to back Obama and now are returning to their GOP roots. Bush won here by 12 points in 2004 and 10 points in 2000. Cedar County, Iowa - Located between Cedar Rapids to the west and the Quad Cities to the east, Cedar County reflects the mix of industry and agriculture common to that part of the state. The birthplace of Iowa\u2019s only president, Herbert Hoover, the county has usually had more of a Democratic lean. But in 2000, Al Gore won by only 2 votes and George W. Bush won the county by one percentage point in 2004. That trend ended in 2008 when Obama won by 10 points in 2008 and by 5 points in 2012. Dunn County, Wisconsin - Got milk?

If Trump really is the Republican William Jennings Bryan, then he would be able to rock and roll with the folks in western Wisconsin.

            "article_content": "(FoxNews.com) Tracing its roots to the year 2000, the Chevrolet Impala\u2019s expiration date is way past due, but the four-door remains one of GM\u2019s top sellers and a cash cow for the automaker, thanks in no small part to its popularity among the nation\u2019s many fleet operators. From the federal government to your local parks and recreation department, the big bland sedan is a no-brainer for many bottom-liners. But they\u2019re not the ones who have to drive it every day. Propelled over the years by a parade of unmemorable powertrains, most recently a pair of lumpy old V6s connected to four-speed transmissions that made the rest of the car appear to be from the distant future, the Impala has represented basic, full-size transportation at its most mediocre. But this year, that all changes. Well, not exactly all of it. For 2012, the $26,585 Impala has been visited by GM\u2019s engine fairy and endowed with the automaker\u2019s very modern and increasingly ubiquitous 3.6-liter directed injected V6. It\u2019s essentially the same motor found under the hood of the Cadillac CTS, Buick LaCrosse and Chevy Camaro. Good company, all. Here the flex-fuel unit produces a very healthy 300 hp, almost as much as the V8 that was last offered in the front-wheel-drive Impala in the (perhaps not so) good old days of 2009. Paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, it delivers 30 mpg on the highway, impressive for such a big boy. Chevy hasn\u2019t gone out of its way to promote this car to the media, or hand out test cars like the candy-colored Sonic subcompacts it\u2019s big on these days, which is somewhat surprising given its continued popularity. So it was a happy accident when we arrived in Detroit to cover the 2012 North American International Auto Show and found one waiting in our Hertz #1 Club Gold parking space. Membership does have its dubious privileges. After confirming its provenance by peeking under the hood, my cameraman and I settled into the plush, terrycloth-esque upholstery, assumed the guise of a pair of grizzled FBI agents on the tail of public enemy number 103 or so, and headed off toward downtown Motown. With authority, I might add. New ticker installed, the Impala is as light on its feet as Don Ameche in the second act of Cocoon. It\u2019s a smooth customer, and looks (like its trying to look) years younger with dual exhaust pipes and an available rear spoiler. The kids call it peacocking, and I\u2019m quite sure the fifty-something valet at our midlevel hotel approved. Nevertheless, the overall effect of the Impala is still best defined by the word \u201cblend\u201d as spoken by Marissa Tomei, especially when painted in the plain white wrapper that ours was. This is a car from the days when style was an unspoken word at GM, and the sizes of windows, doors and trunks were of paramount importance. In fact, in an automotive world quickly filling up with head-turners like the Hyundai Sonata and Dodge Charger, the Impala\u2019s dedication to not upsetting the visual spectrum may soon make it a standout in the crowd. As it is, the Impala could\u2019ve been genetically engineered \u2013 or I suppose in this case simply engineered -- to be the ideal rental or public service vehicle. It\u2019s roomy and plush in an affordable way with oversimplified controls and overboosted power steering that make concentrating on the perp you\u2019re tailing, or the directions to the convention center that much easier. Of course, it is also the last car available with a front bench seat and, finally, not long for this world. A snazzy all-new Impala based on the Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac XTS sedan is on the way next year. May it serve its nation and her travelers well. ---------- 2012 Chevrolet Impala Base Price: $26,585 Type: 5 or 6-passenger 4-door sedan Engine: 3.6L V6 Power: 300 hp, 262 lb-ft torque Transmission: 6-speed automatic MPG: 18 city, 30 hwy",

(Ford) The 2016 Cobra Jet unveiled at the 2015 SEMA show is a factory-built drag racer that can go straight from the dealership to the strip.

(Copyright: Isaac Ireland) The engine is based on the Mustang GT\u2019s 5.0-liter V8, and shares 75 percent of its parts, but gets a Whipple supercharger from the Ford Performance parts catalog that bumps its power up to around 575 hp, plus an electric water pump from the Ford C-Max hybrid to cool it down between runs. (Ford) But that kind of power means nothing if you can\u2019t keep the Cobra Jet\u2019s stock Hoosier slicks on the pavement, so Ford swapped in four-link 9-inch live rear axle, which is just what you want underneath the Christmas Tree\u2026lights, that is. As with past Cobra Jets, Ford is only making 50, split evenly between Oxford White and Deep Impact blue this time around. Certified for several drag racing classes, the starting price for the very street-illegal \u2018Stang is $99,990, and the only options are a Cobra Jet graphics package and a wheelie bar for $1,995 each.

            "article_content": "Picture of female cadets sparks outrage NEW YORK \u2013 The U.S. Military Academy has launched an inquiry into a photo showing 16 black, female cadets in uniform with their fists raised, an image that has spurred questions about whether the gesture violates military restrictions on political activity. West Point is looking into whether the photo broke any rules, Spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Kasker said Saturday. It's unclear how long the inquiry will take and too soon to say what consequences it could have for the cadets, who are poised to graduate May 21. By campus tradition, groups of cadets often take pictures in traditional dress uniforms to echo historical portraits of their cadets. Indeed, a different picture of the same women, without the raised fists, was tweeted out by the chairwoman of the academy's Board of Visitors, 1980 graduate Brenda Sue Fulton. But the fists-up image, which circulated online, led some observers to question whether the women were expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew out of protests over police killings of unarmed black men. The Army Times, which first wrote about the photo Thursday, said several readers had written in to say they believed the cadets were breaching a Defense Department policy that says \"members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity,\" with exceptions for voting and certain other things. But Mary Tobin, a West Point graduate and mentor who knows the students, said they were simply celebrating their forthcoming graduation as a shared accomplishment, like a sports team raising helmets after a win. \"It was a sign of unity,\" Tobin, a 2003 graduate, said by phone. \"They weren't trying to imply any allegiance to any movement.\" The raised fist has served as a symbol of power and resistance for various political movements and causes. The gesture has caused controversy before, including when black American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted gloved fists in black power salutes during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. Yet the cadets, immersed in the insulated and demanding environment of West Point, didn't anticipate how their gesture would be interpreted and the attention it would draw, said Tobin, who has spoken with them about it. \"Their frame of reference is: 'Right now, we're getting ready to graduate in three weeks, I'm standing here with my sisters .... We outlasted a lot of people, black or white, male or female,' \" she said. Black women cadets are rarities at West Point, where about 70 percent of students are white and about 80 percent are men, although the percentage of women has been growing in recent starting classes.",

But on Oct. 11 the company received a notice from the nation\u2019s largest retailer that the bumper sticker had been removed from its marketplace. The notice implied that the bumper sticker had violated the company\u2019s \u201cprohibited products\u201d policy. Owner Dominick Agron was stunned \u2013 so he fired off an email to Walmart demanding to know why the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d bumper sticker was prohibited. Click here to join Todd's American Dispatch, a must-read for conservatives! A spokesperson from Walmart responded Thursday: \"The item you\u2019re asking about was incorrectly removed due to a system error earlier this week and was quickly re-published to our site, which you can see here.\" Later that evening Agron was stunned to receive the following message from Walmart: \u201c\u2019All Lives Matter\u2019 has been deemed an offensive term. These types of items are not appropriate for the Walmart Marketplace.\u201d Mr. Agron was furious. \u201cWalmart should be ashamed of itself,\u201d he said. \u201cTo advocate a view that not all lives matter is deplorable.\u201d Meanwhile, Mr. Agron wrote a letter to the company\u2019s board of directors announcing his intentions to terminate his relationship with Walmart. \u201cAs a result of Walmart\u2019s blatant discrimination and formal position that \u201cALL\u201d lives do not matter, we are terminating our relationship with Walmart effective immediately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am disappointed in your views, but we cannot transact with such a morally corrupt organization.\u201d Mr. Agron\u2019s message apparently was received loud and clear at Walmart headquarters \u2013 because they recently reinstated the bumper sticker. \u201cThey had blamed the removal on a system issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we seriously doubt the veracity of the claim, we are taking it at face value.\u201d Mr. Agron is right to be suspicious. \u201cSomeone needed to code the algorithm in the system to consider the term \u2018All Lives Matter offensive,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cA computer can\u2019t do that on its own.\u201d As a good faith measure, he decided to reinstate all of his other products on the Walmart marketplace. \u201cHowever, we reserve the right to cease dealing with Walmart once again,\u201d he added. Last month a Walmart in Georgia refused to decorate a cake with the words \u201cBlue Lives Matter.\u201d Facing a media firestorm and national outrage, the store had a change of heart and agreed to comply with the customer\u2019s wishes. Sounds like the Walmart bakers may have had the same algorithm problem that resulted in the bumper sticker getting banned. Walmart might want to look into that.",

            "article_content": "Senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Detroit, Michigan The 2016 battleground map is tilting in Hillary Clinton's favor, according to the latest ratings from the Fox News Decision Team -- as recent polling shows the Democrat widening her lead over Donald Trump in a handful of states likely to decide the White House race. The latest Fox News \"2016 Scorecard\" was released Tuesday, and reflects polling conducted after the party conventions in July. While the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s contest with Trump remains tight in most of the battleground states, surveys show her lead widening in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia. As a result, the Fox News Decision Team has moved the states from the \u201ctoss-up\u201d to the \u201clean Democrat\u201d category. \u201cThe race isn\u2019t over in the states we\u2019ve shifted to leaning Democratic, but it\u2019s now clear that Clinton is playing from a position of strength in those states,\u201d the Decision Team said in a statement Tuesday, as the new scorecard was released. \u201cMost worrisome for Trump are the current polling trends in Pennsylvania. No Republican has won Pennsylvania since 1988. But it\u2019s pretty hard to see a path to victory for Trump that doesn\u2019t include a win in the Keystone State.\u201d Trump is fighting hard to win Rust Belt voters, including in Pennsylvania, and has returned on the campaign trail to talking about economic issues -- and, in an appeal to voters in that region, coal jobs. Despite Clinton's post-convention bounce, several polls released this week reflect a tightening race once again. However, Clinton has a built-in advantage with the electoral map, considering more Democrats than Republicans live in many of the country\u2019s most populated states, like California and New York, which as a result gives them more electoral votes. Her growing advantage in states like Virginia only increases that edge. According to the Fox News ratings, if Clinton wins the states considered \"solid\" or \"lean\" Democrat, she would get 273 electoral votes to Trump's 164. That would put Clinton above the 270 electoral votes it takes to win the White House. In another trouble sign for Trump, his drop in the polls in two historically Republican-leaning states -- Arizona and Georgia -- has resulted in the Decision Team moving those states from \"lean GOP\" into the \u201ctoss-up\u201d category. Meanwhile, other vital battleground states, including Ohio and Florida, remain close. In Ohio, Trump and Clinton have been essentially deadlocked since May. A Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday shows Clinton slightly ahead, 49-45 percent. No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio. In Florida, which the Fox News scorecard rates as a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d Trump now trails Clinton just 46-45 percent in Quinnipiac polling, after being behind by nearly 7 points as recently as May. The RealClearPolitics polls average shows Clinton leading by 2.2 points, essentially tied with Trump in Florida, which voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. The RCP average also has Clinton and Trump tied in battleground North Carolina. A Bloomberg Politics Poll released Wednesday on the national race shows Clinton leading Trump by 6 percentage points, 50-to-44 percent, with a 3-point margin of error. Pollsters caution that national surveys so early in the general election, which technically starts after the parties\u2019 nominating conventions, remain largely insignificant until after Labor Day and that their numbers will fluctuate\u00a0until November. To be sure, both candidates have had up-and-down campaigns and poll numbers -- with Clinton continually plagued by her email scandal and voter concerns about her trustworthiness, while Trump continues to make divisive comments that alienate Republican lawmaker and voters. The Clinton campaign, in fact, sent a fundraising memo this week citing the likelihood of poll numbers narrowing as the race heads toward Election Day, as they typically do. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the past month, this race remains incredibly fluid,\u201d campaign manager Robby Mook wrote. \u201cWe fully expect the polls to tighten again.\u201d",

That\u2019s according to a new national Fox News Poll of likely voters conducted Tuesday-Thursday. In the four way race, Clinton tops Trump by a 45-43 percent margin. \u00a0She was up by three points a week ago (44-41 percent) and by six in mid-October (45-39 percent). \u00a0Gary Johnson gets 5 percent and Jill Stein two percent. \u00a0Only four percent are undecided. Without third-party candidates in the mix, Clinton is ahead by just one point: 46-45 percent. \u00a0She was up five points in the two-way last week (49-44 percent, October 22-25). Click here for the full poll results Her lead is within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error in both the two-way and four-way races. Trump is favored by men (+11 points), whites (+19), and whites without a college degree (+33). Clinton leads among women (+13 points), blacks (+74), and voters under age 30 (+17). \u00a0She\u2019s also ahead by 11 points among the one-in-five who have already voted (50-39 percent). They split the support of whites with a college degree: \u00a0Trump gets 45 percent to Clinton\u2019s 42 percent. \u00a0 In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney won this group by 14 points (56-42 percent). Both candidates are consolidating their bases, but Clinton outperforms Trump: \u00a0she gets 90 percent among Democrats and he gets 85 percent of Republicans. Trump has an 8-point edge over Clinton among independents (41-33 percent). \u00a0That\u2019s down from his 13-point advantage last week (41-28 percent). \u00a0Johnson takes 11 percent. Trump has a six-point strength-of-support advantage, as more of his backers (71 percent) say they \u201cstrongly\u201d support their candidate than Clinton supporters (65 percent). \u00a0In addition, his folks (63 percent) are more likely than hers (54 percent) to be \u201cextremely\u201d interested in the race. That enthusiasm gap may be one consequence of the renewed FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. \u00a0How much damage has the scandal really done to her campaign? Some 74 percent of voters say the FBI investigation won\u2019t make a difference to their vote, and four percent actually say it makes them more likely to support her. \u00a0Yet 21 percent say it makes them less likely to vote for her, including 37 percent of Republicans and 21 percent of independents. \u00a0Among Democrats, 5 percent say it makes them less likely to support Clinton, while 7 percent say it makes them more likely. \u201cThe FBI action forced Clinton to play defense in the closing week,\u201d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. \u00a0\u201cBut the number of voters who will move out of her column to someone else will likely be minimal. \u00a0If the election really comes down to the wire, perhaps it makes a difference in a battleground.\u201d \u00a0Anderson conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. Then again, the 59 percent who are bothered by Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server is actually down a touch from 60 percent who felt that way at the end of September. \u00a0 For 39 percent it\u2019s \u201cno big deal.\u201d \u00a0The emails bother almost all Republicans (92 percent), most independents (69 percent), but just one in five Democrats (22 percent). While over half of voters, 51 percent, doubt the FBI will find anything that will lead to criminal charges against Clinton, some 47 percent think it will -- including 42 percent of independents and 16 percent of Democrats. So it\u2019s not surprising that by a 16-point margin, more voters are concerned scandals would have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on a Clinton administration (70 percent) than a Trump administration (54 percent). \u00a0Moreover, nearly half (46 percent) are \u201cvery\u201d worried about scandals if Clinton were elected, up from 37 percent three weeks ago. Then there\u2019s Clinton\u2019s honesty rating. \u00a0It ticked up one point to 31 percent. \u00a0It was a record-low 30 percent among likely voters last week. \u00a0For Trump, 38 percent say he\u2019s honest and trustworthy. \u00a0Honesty is one of the only personal traits where he bests her. \u201cMuch of the recent commentary misses the big picture here,\u201d says Shaw. \u00a0\u201cThe specific charges matter less than the fact that they reinforce the broad sense that Clinton\u2019s dishonest. \u00a0If late-breaking voters decide to make a leap of faith with Trump, it will be because of this feeling.\u201d Fifty-eight percent say Clinton has the temperament to serve effectively as president, compared to just 40 percent for Trump. While both candidates remain unpopular, Clinton\u2019s lost her advantage here. \u00a0Her net negative rating is 13 points (43 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable). \u00a0Last week she was underwater by 8. \u00a0At the same time, Trump\u2019s net negative 12 points (43 favorable vs. 55 unfavorable) improved a bit from negative 14 a week ago. Roughly 15 percent of likely voters dislike both Clinton and Trump. \u00a0Who are they backing? \u00a0Clinton and Johnson garner 25 percent each from this group, and 23 percent go for Trump. The number who think Clinton will win the election is down, yet a majority still thinks she\u2019ll be the next president: \u00a056 percent, down from a high of 66 percent three weeks ago (October 10-12). \u00a0Still, only 35 percent expect a Trump victory. Most of her supporters remain confident in their candidate, as 90 percent think it will be Madame President, down slightly from 93 percent in mid-October. \u00a0At the same time, Trump\u2019s supporters are feeling more confident: 69 percent think he\u2019ll win, up from 56 percent. Meanwhile, 80 percent of Clinton supporters say they\u2019ll accept the election outcome if Trump wins. \u00a0That\u2019s down from 88 percent last week. \u00a0That number holds steady among Trump supporters, as 58 percent say they\u2019ll accept the outcome if Clinton wins. Nearly three-out-of-four will go to the voting booth unhappy with Uncle Sam: \u00a046 percent are \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the way the federal government is working and another 27 percent are \u201cangry.\u201d \u00a0Trump backers are four times as likely as those supporting Clinton to say they\u2019re angry (44 vs. 11 percent). Clinton\u2019s lost ground on the issues. \u00a0For example, the new poll finds likely voters trust her over Trump on making decisions about using nuclear weapons by 16 points. \u00a0That\u2019s down from a 25-point lead in mid-October. The two candidates tie on nominating the next Supreme Court justice and handling terrorism. \u00a0Clinton has consistently been preferred on the court, and in five of the six previous polls she had the edge on terrorism. And Trump\u2019s current 8-point advantage over Clinton on handling the economy is his largest yet. The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,211 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from November 1-3, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 1,107 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among registered voters and plus or minus 3 points among likely voters.",

When history records the story of the 2016 election there will be a particular place of opprobrium for James Comey and Federal Bureau of Investigation. It\u2019s usually a good sign when criminal justice officials manage to make both political parties upset. It\u2019s often a hallmark of justice well served. But not, apparently, when it happens in a round-robin fashion. Comey finishes the election cycle with a letter to congress about the reinvigorated investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, which essentially says: never mind! We have talked before about what we will leave behind after the 2016 election. Lamentably, one of those things is the esteem with which Americans viewed their federal police force. But we will leave that for another time. Right now, what matters is the impact on the election. Is it too close to the end of voting to make a difference? Will anyone really care? To figure that out, the first thing to examine is the effect of Comey\u2019s first letter refreshing the investigation. Some of the perceived consequence wasn\u2019t really from Comey at all, but rather an increase in Republican support for Donald Trump in the closing weeks of the election. As the GOP came home, by and large, the race tightened. Comey\u2019s letter did have some effect though. As we look at the WaPo/ABC News tracking poll, we can see how the buffeting winds of Comeygate blew. Democrats became despondent while Republicans cheered up. When a race is as close as this one, especially in key states, voter intensity means a great deal. It\u2019s one thing to be a likely voter. It\u2019s another thing to be fired up about it and telling your friends, neighbors and relatives to get out and vote. Faced with a possibility of what seemed like criminal charges, Democrats got droopy and Republicans got fired up. We saw that with voters\u2019 favorable views of Clinton taking a hit. But, by the end of last week, even those trends had either stopped or reversed. So does Comey\u2019s fourth-quarter bobble make any difference? Probably so. Look for Democratic voter intensity to jump up as the Clinton campaign touts its vindication of what the Clinton campaign will characterize as an updated version of the candidate\u2019s famous quote: \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d If you thought Team Clinton took victory laps this summer when Comey first dropped the case, you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet. Before today\u2019s announcement, Republicans believed that Comey had delivered Trump\u2019s closing argument: corruption and a call to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Instead, Comey has given Clinton her talking points for the last 50 hours of the race: these Republican guys won\u2019t stop America\u2019s first female president. THE RULEBOOK: TEAM OF RIVALS\u201cThe idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally obtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man.\u201d\u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 70 TIME OUT: PULLING FROM BEHINDIn honor of Saturday\u2019s New York City Marathon, we look back forty years ago, in America\u2019s bicentennial year, when event was first hosted outside Central Park to include the city\u2019s five boroughs.

An 11-mile\u2026stretch of coast was covered in the icy spheres. The sculptural shapes range from the size of a tennis ball to almost [3 feet] across. They result from a rare environmental process where small pieces of ice form, are rolled by wind and water, and end up as giant snowballs. Locals in the village of Nyda, which lies on the Yamal Peninsula just above the Arctic Circle, say they have never seen anything to compare to them. Russian TV quoted an explanation from Sergei Lisenkov, press secretary of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute: \u2018As a rule, first there is a primary natural phenomenon - sludge ice, slob ice. Then comes a combination of the effects of the wind, the lay of the coastline, and the temperature and wind conditions.

Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I\u00a0humbly and gratefully accept your nomination\u00a0for the presidency of the United States. Who would have believed that when we started\u00a0this journey on June 16th of last year we \u2013 and\u00a0I say \u201cwe\u201d because we are a team \u2013 would\u00a0have received almost 14 million votes, the most\u00a0in the history of the Republican Party, and that\u00a0the Republican Party would get 60 percent\u00a0more votes than it received four years ago? The Democrats, on the other hand, received\u00a0almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got\u00a0four years ago. Together, we will lead our party back to the\u00a0White House, and we will lead our country\u00a0back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth.\u00a0But we will also be a country of law and order. Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis\u00a0for our nation.\u00a0The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in\u00a0our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger\u00a0is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have\u00a0seen the recent images of violence in our\u00a0streets and the chaos in our communities.\u00a0Many have witnessed this violence personally,\u00a0some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and\u00a0violence that today afflicts our nation will soon\u00a0come to an end.\u00a0Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be\u00a0restored. The most basic duty of government is to defend\u00a0the lives of its own citizens.\u00a0Any government that fails to do so is a\u00a0government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward\u00a0assessment of the state of our nation.\u00a0I will present the facts plainly and honestly.\u00a0We cannot afford to be so politically correct\u00a0anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the\u00a0carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths --\u00a0the Democrats are holding their convention\u00a0next week.\u00a0But here, at our convention, there will be no\u00a0lies. We will honor the American people with the\u00a0truth, and nothing else. These are the facts: Decades of progress\u00a0made in bringing down crime are now being\u00a0reversed by this Administration\u2019s rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in\u00a0America\u2019s fifty largest cities.\u00a0That\u2019s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation\u2019s capital, killings have risen by 50\u00a0percent.\u00a0They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore. In the President\u2019s hometown of Chicago, more\u00a0than 2,000 people have been the victims of\u00a0shootings this year alone.\u00a0And almost 4,000 have been killed in the\u00a0Chicago area since he took office. The number of police officers killed in the line\u00a0of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to\u00a0this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal\u00a0records, ordered deported from our country,\u00a0are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful\u00a0citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families\u00a0who have crossed the border so far this year\u00a0already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of\u00a0thousands into our communities with no regard\u00a0for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and\u00a0made his way to Nebraska.\u00a0There, he ended the life of an innocent young\u00a0girl named Sarah Root.\u00a0She was 21 years old, and was killed the day\u00a0after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade\u00a0Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and\u00a0he is now a fugitive from the law. I\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s beautiful family.\u00a0But to this Administration, their amazing\u00a0daughter was just one more American life that\u00a0wasn\u2019t worth protecting. One more American child to sacrifice on the\u00a0altar of open borders. What about our economy?\u00a0Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have\u00a0been edited out of your nightly news and your\u00a0morning newspaper: Nearly four in 10 African-American children\u00a0are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than\u00a0when President Obama took his oath of office\u00a0less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the\u00a0workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000\u00a0since the year 2000 \u2013 16\u00a0years ago. Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly $800\u00a0billion last year alone. The budget is no better.\u00a0President Obama has almost doubled our\u00a0national debt to more than 19 trillion dollars,\u00a0and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads\u00a0and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in\u00a0Third World condition, and forty-three million\u00a0Americans are on food stamps. Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic\u00a0disaster, but they have lived through one\u00a0international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors\u00a0being forced to their knees by their Iranian\u00a0captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran\u00a0deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion\u00a0and gave us nothing \u2013 it will go down in history\u00a0as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria \u2013 and the whole world knew it meant nothing. In Libya, our consulate \u2013 the symbol of\u00a0American prestige around the globe \u2013 was\u00a0brought down in flames. America is far less safe \u2013 and the world is far\u00a0less stable \u2013 than when Obama made the\u00a0decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of\u00a0America\u2019s foreign policy.\u00a0I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgement \u2013something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u2013 are\u00a0what caused so many of the disasters unfolding\u00a0today. Let\u2019s review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the\u00a0map.\u00a0Libya was stable.\u00a0Egypt was peaceful.\u00a0Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\u00a0Iran was being choked by sanctions.\u00a0Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we\u00a0have?\u00a0ISIS has spread across the region, and the\u00a0world.\u00a0Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his\u00a0staff were left helpless to die at the hands of\u00a0savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim\u00a0brotherhood, forcing the military to retake\u00a0control. Iraq is in chaos.\u00a0Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.\u00a0Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee\u00a0crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East,\u00a0after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of\u00a0lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever\u00a0been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death,\u00a0destruction, terrorism and weakness. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be\u00a0America\u2019s legacy. The problems we face now \u2013 poverty and\u00a0violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2013\u00a0will last only as long as we continue relying on\u00a0the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to produce\u00a0a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action\u00a0for America. The most important difference between our\u00a0plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan\u00a0will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not\u00a0put America First, then we can be assured that\u00a0other nations will not treat America with\u00a0respect. This will all change when I take office.\u00a0The American People will come first once\u00a0again. My plan will begin with safety at home \u2013 which\u00a0means safe neighborhoods, secure borders,\u00a0and protection from terrorism.\u00a0There can be no prosperity without law and\u00a0order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add\u00a0millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth\u00a0that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline\u00a0tonight will be opposed by some of our nation\u2019s\u00a0most powerful special interests.\u00a0That is because these interests have rigged our\u00a0political and economic system for their\u00a0exclusive benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are\u00a0lining up behind the campaign of my opponent\u00a0because they know she will keep our rigged\u00a0system in place. They are throwing money at her because they\u00a0have total control over everything she does.\u00a0She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton\u2019s message is that\u00a0things will never change. My message is that things have to change \u2013and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a\u00a0better life for the people all across this nation\u00a0that have been ignored, neglected and\u00a0abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and\u00a0the communities crushed by our horrible and\u00a0unfair trade deals.\u00a0These are the forgotten men and women of our\u00a0country.\u00a0People who work hard but no longer have a\u00a0voice. I AM YOUR VOICE. I have embraced crying mothers who have lost\u00a0their children because our politicians put their\u00a0personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance\u00a0for government incompetence, no sympathy for\u00a0leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our\u00a0political system lacks the will, or the courage,\u00a0or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u2013 or\u00a0worse still, has sold out to some corporate\u00a0lobbyist for cash \u2013 I am not able to look the\u00a0other way. And when a Secretary of State illegally stores\u00a0her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000\u00a0of them so the authorities can\u2019t see her crime,\u00a0puts our country at risk, lies about it in every\u00a0different form and faces no consequence \u2013 I\u00a0know that corruption has reached a level like\u00a0never before. When the FBI Director says that the Secretary\u00a0of State was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and\u00a0\u201cnegligent,\u201d in handling our classified secrets, I\u00a0also know that these terms are minor compared\u00a0to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing\u00a0justice for her terrible crimes. In fact, her single greatest accomplishment\u00a0may be committing such an egregious crime\u00a0and getting away with it \u2013 especially when\u00a0others, who have done far less, have paid so\u00a0dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in\u00a0millions of dollars trading access and favors to\u00a0special interests and foreign powers I know the\u00a0time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the\u00a0powerful can no longer beat up on people who\u00a0cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me,\u00a0which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged\u00a0against our citizens, just like it was rigged\u00a0against Bernie Sanders \u2013 he never had a\u00a0chance. But his supporters will join our movement,\u00a0because we will fix his biggest issue: trade\u00a0deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth.\u00a0Millions of Democrats will join our movement,\u00a0because we are going to fix the system so it\u00a0works fairly, and justly, for each and every\u00a0American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen\u00a0continued threats and violence against our law\u00a0enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on\u00a0all Americans. I have a message to every last person\u00a0threatening the peace on our streets and the\u00a0safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to\u00a0our country. I will work with, and appoint, the best and\u00a0brightest prosecutors and law enforcement\u00a0officials to get the job done.\u00a0In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President,\u00a0who has used the pulpit of the presidency to\u00a0divide us by race and color, has made America\u00a0a more dangerous environment for everyone. This Administration has failed America\u2019s inner\u00a0cities. It\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed them on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime. It\u2019s failed them in every way and on every level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that\u00a0all of our kids are treated equally, and\u00a0protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this\u00a0make life better for young Americans in\u00a0Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have the same right to live out their dreams as\u00a0any other child in America? To make life safe for all our citizens, we must\u00a0also address the growing threats we face from\u00a0outside the country: we are going to defeat the\u00a0barbarians of ISIS. Once again, France is the victim of brutal\u00a0Islamic terrorism.\u00a0Men, women and children viciously mowed\u00a0down.\u00a0Lives ruined.\u00a0Families ripped apart.\u00a0A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be\u00a0inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven\u00a0over and over \u2013 at the World Trade Center, at\u00a0an office party in San Bernardino, at the\u00a0Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center\u00a0in Chattanooga, and many more. Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49\u00a0wonderful Americans were savagely murdered\u00a0by an Islamic terrorist.\u00a0This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBTQ community. As your President, I will do everything in my\u00a0power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the\u00a0violence and oppression of a hateful foreign\u00a0ideology. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus\u00a0on three things. We must have the best intelligence-gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who\u00a0share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping\u00a0out Islamic terror.\u00a0This includes working with our greatest ally in\u00a0the region, the State of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete,\u00a0because it did not properly cover terror, and\u00a0also, that many of the member countries were\u00a0not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking\u00a0up the cost.\u00a0Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO\u00a0will be setting up a new program in order to\u00a0combat terrorism -- a true step in the right\u00a0direction. Lastly, we must immediately suspend\u00a0immigration from any nation that has been\u00a0compromised by terrorism until such time as\u00a0proven vetting mechanisms have been put in\u00a0place. My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent\u00a0increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing\u00a0massive refugee flows coming into our country\u00a0under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there\u2019s\u00a0no way to screen these refugees in order to\u00a0find out who they are or where they come\u00a0from. I only want to admit individuals into our country\u00a0who will support our values and love our\u00a0people.\u00a0Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or\u00a0oppression is not welcome in our country and\u00a0never will be. Decades of record immigration have produced\u00a0lower wages and higher unemployment for our\u00a0citizens, especially for African-American and\u00a0Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system\u00a0that works, but one that works for the American\u00a0people. On Monday, we heard from three parents\u00a0whose children were killed by illegal immigrants\u00a0Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and\u00a0Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of\u00a0many thousands who have suffered so gravely.\u00a0Of all my travels in this country, nothing has\u00a0affected me more deeply than the time I have\u00a0spent with the mothers and fathers who have\u00a0lost their children to violence spilling across our\u00a0border. These families have no special interests to\u00a0represent them.\u00a0There are no demonstrators to protest on their\u00a0behalf.\u00a0My opponent will never meet with them, or\u00a0share in their pain.\u00a0Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?\u00a0Where was the sanctuary for the children of\u00a0Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was the sanctuary for all the other\u00a0Americans who have been so brutally\u00a0murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been\u00a0alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation\u00a0stand in their corner to support them, to send\u00a0them our love, and to pledge in their honor that\u00a0we will save countless more families from\u00a0suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to\u00a0stop illegal immigration, to stop the drugs from\u00a0pouring into our communities, and to stop the\u00a0gangs and the violence that have stolen too\u00a0many innocent lives. I have been honored to receive the\u00a0endorsement of America\u2019s Border Patrol\u00a0Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system. By ending catch-and-release on the border, we\u00a0will end the cycle of human smuggling and\u00a0violence.\u00a0Illegal border crossings will go down.\u00a0Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who\u00a0overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive\u00a0the respect they deserve. Tonight, I want every American whose\u00a0demands for immigration security have been\u00a0denied \u2013 and every politician who has denied them \u2013 to listen very closely to the words am about to say. On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the\u00a0oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in\u00a0a country where the laws of the United States\u00a0are enforced. We are going to be considerate and\u00a0compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own\u00a0struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty,\u00a0mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.\u00a0Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty. I have a different vision for our workers.\u00a0It begins with a new, fair trade policy that\u00a0protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. It\u2019s been a signature message of my campaign\u00a0from day one, and it will be a signature feature\u00a0of my presidency from the moment I take the\u00a0oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business\u00a0making deals \u2013 now I\u2019m going to make our\u00a0country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements\u00a0into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly one-third of its\u00a0manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the\u00a0enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever\u00a0made by our country. Never again. I am going to bring back our jobs to Ohio, and\u00a0Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan\u00a0and to all of America \u2013 and I am not going to let\u00a0companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. My opponent, on the other hand, has supported\u00a0virtually every trade agreement that has been\u00a0destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported\u00a0China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade\u00a0Organization \u2013 another one of her husband\u2019s colossal mistakes. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific\u00a0Partnership \u2013 which will not only destroy our\u00a0manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that\u00a0hurts our workers, or that diminishes our\u00a0freedom and independence.\u00a0Instead, I will make individual deals with\u00a0individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive\u00a0transactions, with many countries, that are\u00a0thousands of pages long \u2013 and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations\u00a0against any country that cheats.\u00a0This includes stopping China\u2019s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China, and\u00a0many others, will be totally renegotiated.\u00a0That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a\u00a0much better deal for America \u2013 and we\u2019ll walk\u00a0away if we don\u2019t get the deal that we want. Our country is going to start building and\u00a0making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws,\u00a0regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax\u00a0increase, I have proposed the largest tax\u00a0reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year \u2013 Democrat or Republican.\u00a0Middle-income Americans and businesses will\u00a0experience profound relief, and taxes will be\u00a0greatly simplified for everyone. America is one of the highest-taxed nations in\u00a0the world.\u00a0Reducing taxes will cause new companies and\u00a0new jobs to come roaring back into our\u00a0country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of\u00a0regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of\u00a0them all.\u00a0Excessive regulation is costing our country as\u00a0much as $2 trillion a year, and we will\u00a0end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the\u00a0production of American energy.\u00a0This will produce more than $20 trillion in\u00a0job-creating economic activity over the next\u00a0four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put\u00a0the great miners and steel workers of our\u00a0country out of work \u2013 that will never happen\u00a0when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of\u00a0dollars will start flowing into our country.\u00a0This new wealth will improve the quality of life\u00a0for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges,\u00a0tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.\u00a0This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by\u00a0helping their parents send them to a safe\u00a0school of their choice.\u00a0My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats\u00a0than serve American children. We will repeal and replace disastrous\u00a0Obamacare.\u00a0You will be able to choose your own doctor\u00a0again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We're going to work with all of our students\u00a0who are drowning in debt to take the pressure\u00a0off these young people just starting out their\u00a0adult lives. We will completely rebuild our depleted military,\u00a0and the countries that we are protecting, at a\u00a0massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their\u00a0fair share. We will take care of our great Veterans like\u00a0they have never been taken care of before.\u00a0My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country\u00a0will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their\u00a0choice. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal \u2013 one\u00a0more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in\u00a0government to provide a list of wasteful\u00a0spending projects that we can eliminate in my\u00a0first 100 days.\u00a0The politicians have talked about it, I\u2019m going to\u00a0do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the\u00a0United States Supreme Court who will uphold\u00a0our laws and our Constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia\u00a0will be a person of similar views, principles, and\u00a0judicial philosophy.\u00a0This will be one of the most important issues\u00a0decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the\u00a02nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received\u00a0the early and strong endorsement of the\u00a0National Rifle Association and will protect the\u00a0right of all Americans to keep their families\u00a0safe. At this moment, I would like to thank the\u00a0evangelical and religious community in general\u00a0who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have much to contribute to our politics, yet\u00a0our laws prevent you from speaking your minds\u00a0from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson,\u00a0many years ago, threatens religious institutions\u00a0with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they\u00a0openly advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that\u00a0language and protect free speech for all\u00a0Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so\u00a0much more \u2013 all we need to do is start believing\u00a0in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America\u00a0Is Back \u2013 bigger, and better and stronger than\u00a0ever before. In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side\u00a0my wife Melania and my wonderful children,\u00a0Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will\u00a0always be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and\u00a0hardest working man I ever knew.\u00a0I wonder sometimes what he\u2019d say if he were here to see this tonight. It\u2019s because of him that I learned, from my\u00a0youngest age, to respect the dignity of work\u00a0and the dignity of working people.\u00a0He was a guy most comfortable in the company\u00a0of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and\u00a0I have a lot of that in me also. Then there\u2019s my mother, Mary.\u00a0She was strong, but also warm and fairminded.\u00a0She was a truly great mother.\u00a0She was also one of the most honest and\u00a0charitable people have ever known, and a great judge of character. To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my\u00a0brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will\u00a0always give you my love you are most special\u00a0to me. I have had a truly great life in business.\u00a0But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go\u00a0to work for our country \u2013 to go to work for you.\u00a0It\u2019s time to deliver a victory for the American\u00a0people. But to do that, we must break free from the\u00a0petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and\u00a0strivers that is being led by a group of censors,\u00a0critics, and cynics. Remember: all of the people telling you that you\u00a0can\u2019t have the country you want, are the same\u00a0people telling you that I wouldn\u2019t be standing\u00a0here tonight. No longer can we rely on those same people in\u00a0the media, and politics, who will say anything to\u00a0keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\u00a0History is watching us now. It\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion,\u00a0and if we will show the whole world that\u00a0America is still free and independent and\u00a0strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can\u00a0be your champion in the White House. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a\u00a0three-word loyalty pledge.

So to every parent who dreams for their child,\u00a0and every child who dreams for their future, I\u00a0say these words to you tonight:\u00a0I\u2019m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and\u00a0in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again.

            "article_content": "Trump's campaign is getting an infusion of cash amid troubles for Clinton; Ed Henry explains on 'Special Report' EXCLUSIVE: Billionaire Sheldon Adelson just committed $25 million to an anti-Hillary Clinton Super PAC to try and help tilt the presidential race and down ballot House and Senate races to Republicans, Fox News learned Monday. There are indications the casino magnate will pony up even more by the end of the week. Two senior Republican sources familiar with the donation described it to Fox News as a \u201cmassive\u201d amount of money to be spent during the final week of the presidential race and a sign that Adelson, who has largely been on the sidelines after initially suggesting he would give $100 million to help Donald Trump, is now going all in on the Republican nominee. The money will benefit Future 45, a Super PAC launched by the Ricketts family in Chicago, founders of TD Ameritrade. The group has recently been running a television ad in battlegrounds comparing Clinton to Richard Nixon, calling her a \u201csecretive, paranoid politician who destroyed 30,000 pieces of evidence.\u201d The Republican sources said the contribution was made in the last few days as the FBI re-ignited its investigation of Clinton\u2019s email server, and could spark other big GOP donors \u2013 who may have thought the Democratic nominee was coasting to victory just days ago -- to step up their support of Trump in the final days. Most importantly, one source familiar with the Adelson contribution revealed he is considering pouring as much as another $25 million dollars into the race before Election Day on November 8. The first major contribution came as Trump visited Adelson\u2019s Venetian resort and casino in Las Vegas for a rally with supporters on Sunday. Trump praised Adelson and his wife, Miriam, without any reference to the money that went to the Super PAC. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the owner of this great hotel, and his incredible wife \u2013 she\u2019s an incredible woman \u2013 Sheldon Adelson,\u201d Trump said to cheers. \u201cReally incredible people and they\u2019ve been so supportive and we appreciate it.\u201d The move represents a startling turnaround for the Ricketts and Adelson.The Ricketts initially spent millions trying to stop Trump from getting the Republican nomination, after backing Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in the GOP primaries.",

            "article_content": "Officials hold press conference on nightclub attack that left 50 people dead EDITOR'S NOTE: Orlando's mayor on Monday revised the death toll in the nightclub shooting to 49, from 50. The 50th body was identified as gunman Omar Mateen. Omar Mateen was identified as the gunman in the Orlando nightclub shooting. (Orlando Police) A gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS opened fire early Sunday morning in a packed Orlando nightclub, killing 50 people and wounding at least 53 more in the\u00a0deadliest mass\u00a0shooting in modern U.S. history. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack Sunday afternoon via its Amaq news agency, Reuters reported. Amaq said an \"Islamic State fighter\" carried out the assault. It was not clear, however, if the shooting was actually directed by the terror group or only inspired by it. The attack in Orlando at Pulse, which bills itself as \"the hottest gay bar\"\u00a0in the city and was packed with more than 300 people for \"Latin Night,\" was reported minutes after 2 a.m. Sunday. It ended hours later when police stormed the building and killed the shooter. WARNING: Graphic. video of victims outside pulse in orlando right now. terrifying. #PulseOrlando #PulseShooting pic.twitter.com/8hBaXB2ueT Dozens of partygoers remained hostage in the club for several hours after the initial shooting, prompting SWAT teams to rush inside. Shortly after 6 a.m. local time, Orlando police tweeted that the gunman had been killed. Authorities said there was not believed to be any further threat to the area. \"We know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate,\" President Obama said in a speech from the White House on Sunday, cautioning that it was still early in the investigation. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Schiff said in a statement that the timing and location of the attack and information coming from local authorities indicated \"an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.\" Thank youu i jumped out theres people still hiding inside the closets that the shooters dont know theyre in there  https://t.co/NoOIud4Hxe \"The fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT night club during Pride, and \u2013 if accurate \u2013 that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,\" Schiff said. \"Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed, remains to be determined. I\u2019m confident that we will know much more in the coming hours and days.\" The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting \"Allah Akbar\" while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News. Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News reported. Mateen was interviewed three times by FBI agents -- twice in 2013, once in 2014 -- as part of two separate investigations, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said. However, both inquiries proved inconclusive and the cases were closed. UPDATE: Chilling text exchange between mother and son. His condition is not yet know #Pulse pic.twitter.com/tslcUYvenf Mateen was not under surveillance or the subject of an active investigation at the time of the shooting, Hopper said. The 2013 investigation was related to comments Mateen allegedly made to a co-worker \"alleging possible terror ties.\" FBI agents were unable to \"verify the substance\" of his comments, Hopper said. Mateen was also interviewed in 2014 due to his ties to an American man who later drove an explosive-laden truck into a restaurant in Syria for an Al Qaeda affiliate. Mateen and the suicide bomber, Monar abu Salha, attended the same mosque, however, the FBI determined their contact \"was minimal,\" Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Mike McCaul told Fox News. Mateen was a U.S. citizen, Rep. Alan Grayson said during a Sunday morning news conference, though that was \"not true of other family members of his.\" Mateen, 29, lived in Fort Pierce, Fla. He was born in New York to parents of Afghan origin and was a Muslim, Fox News confirmed. Mateen was married in 2009 to a woman who was born in Uzbekistan, according to the couple's marriage license, but the two divorced in 2011. \"He was not a stable person,\" the ex-wife, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told\u00a0The Washington Post. \"He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn\u2019t finished or something like that.\" A mortgage form from 2013 lists Noor Salman as his wife and Mateen also had a 3-year-old son. Mateen appears to have had no criminal record. A licensed security officer, Mateen also had a statewide firearms license. He purchased two guns -- a handgun and a long gun -- legally during the week before the shooting, an ATF official said. Pulse shooting: In hail of gunfire in which suspect was killed, OPD officer was hit.

This includes searching for any traces of propaganda, scrubbing of his web browsing history, and running down communications with individuals via social media and mobile messaging apps. As victims poured through their doors, Orlando Regional Medical Center officials called in six trauma surgeons, including a pediatric surgeon, Dr. Michael Cheatham said. Many of the wounded were \"critically ill\" due to their injuries, Cheatham said, and the hospital was trying to reach out to their families. \"I think we will see the death toll rise,\" Cheatham told The Associated Press.

Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in Orange County following the attack and asked for a moment of silence throughout the country at 6 p.m. on Sunday. \"This is an attack on our people,\" Scott tweeted around 11:40 a.m. \"It's an attack on Orlando. It's an attack on FL. It's an attack on America. It's an attack on all of us.\" Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said officers were initially engaged in a gun battle outside the club before the suspect, armed with a handgun and \"assault-type rifle,\" went back into the building, where more shots were fired. He said the gunman then took several hostages. \"It appears he was organized and well-prepared,\" Mina said. Officials said Mateen had some communication with police during this standoff, though they did not reveal what was said. Eleven officers were involved in raiding the nightclub, and one officer was injured, according to Banks. The injured officer was hit by a bullet and his Kevlar helmet saved his life, Banks said. A hotline for victims' families was set up at 407-246-4357. Identities of victims were being released at cityoforlando.net/victims after family members had been notified. Witnesses in the club reported mass chaos after hearing several shots ring out inside the nightclub. Pulse posted on its own Facebook page around 2 a.m.: \"Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.\" It's owner later said in statement that she was \"devastated by the horrific events that have taken place today. Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years. From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGTQ community.\u00a0 I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to all who have lost loved ones,\" Barbara Roma. Mina Justice was outside the club early Sunday trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: \"He's coming.\" \"The next text said: 'He has us, and he's in here with us,'\" she said. \"That was the last conversation.\" Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon came into the front of the room. \"I heard 20, 40, 50 shots,\" Alamo said. \"The music stopped.\" Club-goer Rob Rick said it happened around 2 a.m., just before closing time. \"Everybody was drinking their last sip,\" he said.

            "article_content": "Hillary's allies target the FBI director For Democrats singing his praises just months ago, FBI Director James Comey is no longer the paragon of impartiality. The bureau boss is now the target of barbed Democratic attacks for his decision to notify lawmakers Friday that investigators were reviewing newly discovered emails related to the Hillary Clinton server case. And some of the same Democrats who over the summer defended Comey in the face of Republican pressure have emerged as his toughest critics. Topping that list is Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader who fired off a letter over the weekend to Comey informing him his actions may have violated a federal law known as the Hatch Act, \u201cwhich bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election.\u201d Reid accused Comey of a \u201cdouble-standard\u201d in his treatment of sensitive information, saying: \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d But Republicans argue it is Democrats showing a double-standard. Reid, after the bureau announced no criminal charges in the Clinton case back in July, previously called Comey a \u201cfair, impartial director.\u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d that whoever wrote the latest Reid statement had to be \u201cunder the influence.\u201d \u201cSenator Reid is a political hack. Jim Comey is a law enforcement officer,\u201d Gowdy said Sunday. Reid noted in his letter to Comey that he has indeed supported Comey in the past, including by helping get him confirmed to the post because he believed he was a \u201cprincipled public servant.\u201d Reid pointedly concluded, \u201cWith the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.\u201d On the House side, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also applied pressure to Comey on Friday to provide more details, suggesting the format of his brief letter to Congress has stoked false claims. \u201cThe public interest would be served by the FBI providing the facts, rather than allowing Republicans to stoke innuendo and falsehoods 11 days away from a presidential election,\u201d she said in a statement. On July 7, Pelosi called Comey a \u201cgreat man.\u201d \u201cWe are very privileged in our country to have him be director of the FBI,\u201d she said at the time. The White House, meanwhile, defended Comey on Monday. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t believe Director Comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election,\u201d Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. The Clinton campaign, though, has challenged Comey to release more details, questioning the handling of Friday\u2019s notification to Congress. \u201cWhat's disturbing about this again is that a three paragraph letter\u00a0with no information whatsoever about what the FBI is talking about was sent to the individuals named on the letter,\u201d Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cDirector Comey owes it to the American people, releasing this just a matter of days before the election to provide all the information.\u201d Back in July, Clinton herself told PBS she was \u201cgrateful for the professionalism of the FBI and the Department of Justice.\u201d Interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile also has kept the pressure on, tweeting and retweeting a series of articles over the weekend that criticized Comey\u2019s decision to go forward with this information now, days before the presidential election. Yet on July 7, Brazile defended Comey on Twitter against Republican questions. \u201cPathetic. Simply pathetic to watch members of Congress grill Director Comey because he's not playing their game of gotcha. #Overreach,\u201d she wrote. Republicans, too, have adopted a much different tone toward Comey in the past three days than they did in the wake of the bureau\u2019s July announcement on the Clinton case. Donald Trump for weeks had been pointing to the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the Clinton case to further his claims that the election is \u201crigged\u201d against him. But within minutes of the FBI\u2019s announcement that it was reviewing newly discovered emails, Trump backed off his criticism of the bureau. He told supporters on Friday he has great respect for the FBI and praised the bureau for having the \u201ccourage\u201d to \u201cright the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d",

(AndrewAvitus/Wikimedia) A statue of Andrew Jackson in downtown Jacksonville has been the target of protests for the second time in a week. According to The Florida Times Union, the base of the statue was sprayed Sunday morning with large, orange letters spelling: \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cjustice 4 D.\u201d The message apparently referred to D\u2019anglo Stallworth, a 28-year-old who was shot and killed by police on May 12 in Jacksonville. Ed Block, a local attorney representing the Stallworth family, told the newspaper that the family has many unanswered questions but stressed that they have asked for peace and do not condone vandalizing public property. The first incident occured June 30 when a Native American mask was found on Jackson\u2019s lap.Jackson is notorious for signing the Indian Removal Act of 1830, forcing thousands of Native Americans to relocate west of the Mississippi River. It is estimated that 4,000 died during the journey on the \u201cTrail of Tears.\u201d Although a well-known slave owner, Jackson believed in the fair treatment of slaves, telling one overseer, \u201cthat he was to treat them with great humanity, feed and cloath them well, and work them in moderation.\u201d When Jackson learned that one of his slaves was killed by an overseer, Jackson fired the man. He tried to indict the overseer for murder, telling the state prosecutor that he saw himself as \u201cthe guardian of my slave, [and] it is my duty to prosecute the case so far as justice to him [the slave] may require it.\u201d A grand jury, however, refused to indict. Jacksonville is named after the 7th U.S. president who led the army, as a Major General, in an invasion of Spanish Florida in First Seminole War in 1818, leading to the acquisition of the territory.

            "article_content": "Republican vice-presidential nominee Gov. Mike Pence, right, and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine debate during the vice-presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016. (Andrew Gombert/Pool via AP) The tiny Virginia town of Farmville, home to Longwood University and Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate, prides itself as a \u201cTree City USA\u201d \u2013 the benefits of which, we\u2019re told, include \u201ca framework for action, education, a positive image and citizen pride.\u201d It\u2019s safe to assume that the evening\u2019s two combatants \u2013 Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2013 walked onto the debate stage hoping to achieve those same goals (especially the part about a positive image). How\u2019d they do? Here are five observations. The Tone. The evening started out on a civil tone and it stayed that way, for the most \u2013 even if one of the debaters did his best to instill some southern discomfort into the conversation (more on that in a moment). Kaine opened the proceedings by praising Hillary Clinton for her smarts and experience and wanting to build \u201ca community of respect\u201d (a bow to the civil rights movement). He then took a dig at Donald Trump. Pence likewise praised his running mate, but didn\u2019t neglect to point out that the public is in a wrong-track mood so why vote for more of the same. And so it went through the night \u2013 each defending, even extolling their running mates\u2019 virtues. Granted, most any debate without Trump is going to seem somber. But this one was about as far as you get from an endorphin rush \u2013 nothing resembling Trump-level Fourth of July fireworks. Neither man raised his voice. Even when one candidate attacked the other ticket\u2019s greatest weakness \u2013 Trump\u2019s temperament, Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness \u2013 it lacked the vitriol evident at the first presidential debate. Remember this calm when Clinton and Trump mix it up again, Sunday evening in St. Louis. Pence. Kaine called his debate foe \u201cTrump\u2019s apprentice.\u201d Truth is, the Indiana governor is more like Trump\u2019s antipode . . . for his calm demeanor and steady explanations of policy and his opponents\u2019 shortcomings. Pence had a few good lines. For example, this passage when pushing back against Kaine for his propensity for touting economic-recovery numbers: \u201cPeople in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne know different.\u201d For those expecting an aggressive performance or a pound of Democratic flesh, Pence didn\u2019t deliver. He was more guide dog than attack dog \u2013 though he almost bared his fangs just past the one-hour mark, when Kaine kept mentioning Trump\u2019s taxes. There\u2019s a reason why someone came up with the phrase \u201cMidwest nice.\u201d Kaine. Asked a question about doubts over his running mate\u2019s character, he instead berated Trump\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d persona. When Pence began to cover the Clinton foreign policy record during her Foggy Bottom tenure, Kaine butted in \u2013 and kept interrupting as the night went on. Why the rudeness? A tactical choice to keep the mild-mannered Pence off-stride. Kaine had his talking points at the ready \u2013 too many of them, as Pence kept noting. Give Kaine demerits for too many slangy one-liners \u2013 a Clinton-Kaine \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d jobs program, a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d Trump-Pence plan, etc. And I\u2019d further downgrade Kaine for this blunder: he went through an entire back-and-forth about immigration without taking advantage of his fluency in Spanish. Increible! Bottom line: a tree doesn\u2019t grow in Kaine-ville. The senator left the positive image in the green room. Quijano. This debate\u2019s moderator, CBS News\u2019 Elaine Quijano, got a yuuuge break in that she was tasked with controlling two candidates described by some as vanilla nice. Quijano asked solid and straightforward questions: why the presidential nominees are dogged by character questions, how their economic plans will work, what to do about policing and public safety, illegal immigration, how to combat home-grown terrorism, and so forth. For those of you wagering on the first media-bias moment, it may have come at the 35-minute mark when Quijano pressed Pence on South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican and African-American, being harassed by Capitol Police \u2013 with no pushback against Kaine on Black Lives Matter and violent civil disobedience. Where I\u2019d further critique Quijano: she also put Pence on the spot for Trump\u2019s immigration plan. Was it my imagination or did Pence get most of the questions directed his way? Though she did ask both candidates their faith, Quijano didn\u2019t press Kaine on abortion, which may have been a deal-killer for Barack Obama when he was looking for a running mate in 2008. The topic didn\u2019t come up until 98 minutes into the 105-minute debate. She also whiffed on pressing Pence over Indiana\u2019s religious-freedom law. Two debates down, two to go, and I\u2019m still waiting for a tough question hurled the Democrats\u2019 way. What\u2019s Next. It wasn\u2019t the high road to Farmville \u2014at least not so for Kaine, whose strategy was to keep his opponent off-stride and off-message. Rarely did he take a pass on mentioning Trump\u2019s character and temperament, even when it wasn\u2019t his turn to talk (the unofficial Fox News count was 39 Kaine interruption to 19 for Pence). And that\u2019s how it may look for the remaining five weeks: Clinton\u2019s campaign believes it has a lead that Trump can\u2019t overcome. Look for Hillary to do her best to keep Trump off-balance and out-of-sorts in the remaining two debates. America\u2019s Civil War came to its conclusion not far from Farmville, at the Appomattox Court House. In 2016, the uncivil war that is Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton continues with two more clashes \u2013 debates on Oct. 9 and Oct. 19 \u2013 before hostilities cease (we hope) on Election Day. I give Pence the edge on the night \u2013 but that\u2019s due in large part to Kaine\u2019s acting anything but a Virginia gentleman. Had Pence been more forceful in a few moments and pushed harder on voter dissatisfaction with the economy and the political class, it would have been a bigger night. Tune in Sunday night, October 9, to see if Trump can trump that.",

Federal policy that allows Central American children apprehended by Border Patrol to be placed with illegal immigrant sponsors has sent thousands of teens to the region in recent years. While most don't arrive as hardened gang members, many are placed in homes with little supervision, say critics. Nisa Mickens, (l.), and Kayla Cuevas, (r.) \u201cIt should not be surprising that when these kids are allowed to enter illegally and then are placed in the custody of someone who is here illegally, they do not have much of an interest in complying with the process,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director for policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. Compounding matters for some communities on Long Island, which has been plagued with violent crimes from the notorious El Salvadoran gang MS-13, is Suffolk County's status as a sanctuary county. The Center for Immigration Studies reports that Sheriff Vincent DeMarco, who could not be reached for comment, refuses to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers without a warrant. Vaughan noted that illegal immigrants have a big incentive to sign up as sponsors of unaccompanied children, whether they are family or not: Doing so shields them from deportation. Sliwa says Suffolk County's sanctuary city status makes it a recruting pipeline for gangs. (Associated Press) Curtis Sliwa, founder of the community protection group the Guardian Angels, said Suffolk County being a sanctuary region only empowers MS-13. \"Sanctuary will have a great impact on safety in Suffolk County as long as gang bangers are allowed to prey on their own people,\" says Sliwa, referring to the MS-13 primarily targeting Central American migrants for gang membership. Known for patrolling subway platforms in New York City, Sliwa has now deployed Guardian Angels to bucolic communities on eastern Long Island, where violent crime at the hands of MS-13 is rising. Vaughan and others claim the situation is a recruiting pipeline for MS-13, and Suffolk County has seen a rise of the notorious and violent gang. Last month, Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, both 15, were brutally murdered. Days after the teens were found beaten to death, the skeletal remains of 19-year-old Oscar Acosta and 15-year-old Miguel Garcia-Moran were discovered, all allegedly linked, according to the Suffolk County Police Department, to this violent clique -- sparking community outrage. Vaughan has observed, through close analysis of immigration court records, that about half of the children are not showing up to their hearings. \u201cWhen they do, they typically are ordered to be deported, but under current policies, they are not a high priority to be tracked down for enforcement, unless they are convicted of a serious crime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s approach to dealing with the surge in illegal alien minors from Central America has been nothing short of a disaster for many communities.\u201d She said most of the children are not qualified for any kind of legal status here and are likely to be non-compliant with immigration regulations, especially when housed with an illegal immigrant. \u201cWhen that happens, they are usually ordered removed in absentia, but then ICE has to track them down, which isn\u2019t easy and requires a lot of resources,\u201d she says. Between 2013 and 2015, ICE had deported 5,834 people who entered the country as unaccompanied children, but by the time the feds catch up to them they are well into their adult years and have already committed a violent crime. Mark Weber, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the goal of the program is to place the children with their parents or family members who are already in the country -- regardless of their immigration status. \u201cLast year, 55 percent of children were released to a parent, 36 percent were released to a close family member and the remaining 9 percent were released to a distant or non-relative sponsor,\u201d says Weber. Weber says he does not have updated figures on how many children were placed with illegal immigrant sponsors, which includes home visits and follow-up calls once the child has been placed with the sponsor. However, the statistics posted on the HHS website tell part of the story. According to the HHS website, in fiscal year 2015 only 1,895 home visits were conducted out of 33,726 referrals made by DHS. Vaughan expressed little confidence in the follow-up phone call system, saying there is no way to monitor the progress of the child. Over the past four years alone, 225,725 unaccompanied Central American children have entered the United States -- with nearly 3,500 of them being placed in Suffolk County between October 2013 and July 2016. \"This influx has strained school systems in many places, and even worse, the lax oversight has enabled criminal gangs, especially MS-13, and trafficking organizations to bring in kids to boost their numbers,\" Vaughan says. \"The federal agencies and their contractors have failed in their responsibility to ensure the welfare of these kids; in fact, they admit that they have completely lost track of most of these teenagers.\" Sliwa expressed frustration with politicians who are obsessed with preventing ISIS attacks while gangs such as MS-13 wreak havoc around the nation and HHS continues the flood of Central American children in communities that are not prepared for the fallout. \"All you hear is crickets from both sides of the aisle,\" says Sliwa. \"Politicians don't get gangs.\"",

            "article_content": "Reaction from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel and analysis of the state of the race FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI\u2019s original investigation into her use of a private email server still stands. Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would in the unrelated case review additional emails related to Clinton\u2019s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,\u201d Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. \u201cDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.\u201d A Department of Justice spokesperson said that agency and the FBI \u201cdedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.\u201d When asked where the email investigation stands after Comey's letter, a senior law enforcement official close to the probe described the matter to Fox News as \"closed.\" Attorney General Loretta Lynch was briefed on the FBI's findings before Comey sent the letter, the official said. Lynch's position on the email investigation, \"has not changed,\" meaning that she'll accept the findings of the agents and prosecutors on the case, according to the official. In addition, Fox News is told that Lynch maintains her confidence in Comey and his ability to run the FBI. The letter was another unexpected turn in the close White House race between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump, with Election Day on Tuesday. Whether the close of the new probe takes away Trump apparent late momentum remains unclear. Reaction from the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill to the letter, which still appears to leaves some unanswered questions, was swift and largely partisan. \u201cWe're glad this issue is resolved but for the record, this could easily have been learned before 1st letter was sent,\u201d tweeted Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton Democratic presidential campaign. The new case is purportedly related to ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner using a laptop he shared with estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin for \u201csexting\u201d an apparently underage female. Comey\u2019s letter last month said only that a new batch of emails \u201cappeared to be pertinent\u201d to the FBI\u2019s original Clinton email investigation. Comey in July concluded the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of the private server system while at the State Department by saying some of the emails contained classified information and that Clinton has been \u201cextremely careless.\u201dHowever, he declined to recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department, and the case was effectively closed. Clinton has not yet commented yet on the letter,\u00a0but at a rally in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Trump told supporters that the investigation \"will go on,\" and Clinton was being \"protected by a rigged system.\" \"You can't review 650,000 emails in 8 days,\" Trump said. \"Now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.\" Ealier in the day, Trump running-mate Mike Pence said at a rally in North Carolina: \u201cThe FBI last summer concluded that Hillary Clinton having classified documents on that private server was extremely careless.\u00a0And I guess today, I don\u2019t know if you heard, today they announced that they had not changed that conclusion.\u00a0But you know, mishandling classified information is a crime.\u201d The Clinton campaign and it supporters howled that Comey with his October letter had injected himself in the closing days of the very close White House race, while providing little information about the emails and the new probe. Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Bair\u201d on Sunday night said he wasn\u2019t surprise by the letter and continues to have questions -- including whether Clinton has lied under oath about mishandling classified information in her State Department emails and what is the threshold to prove criminal intent. \u201cWhat level do you need to get to to actually prove intent?\u201d Chaffetz asked. \u201cThey did not answer the question yet as to\u00a0 whether Hillary Clinton has\u00a0 committed perjury.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Sunday night: \"Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security.\u201d \u201cShe simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules. ... The American people should not have to endure four more years of their scandal and baggage. \u2026 Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump\u00a0on Tuesday.\" Trump landed in Minnesota for a rally after\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement was made public. He made no direct mention of the issue and continued to insist that Clinton would be under investigation during her potential presidency. \"She's protected by a rigged system,\" he told supporters. \"She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said after the letter\u2019s release:\u00a0\"While the original letter allowed days of innuendo and falsehood by Republicans desperate to divert attention from themselves, the FBI's swift and thorough review should finally close the door on this Republican sideshow.\u201d Fox News' Matt Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "April 28, 2016: Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court meets with Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland detailed his most significant cases in thousands of pages of documents submitted to Congress Tuesday, including his role as a federal prosecutor in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case and the prosecution of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. The lengthy questionnaire isn't likely to sway many minds in Congress, where Republicans have insisted on delaying the Supreme Court fight until after the presidential election. But the White House still had Garland fill out a questionnaire, and the committee posted the document online, as is routine with nominations. Garland is currently the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Garland's account of his most significant opinions as a judge includes one that upheld a ban on campaign contributions from federal contractors. Another affirmed the application of the Endangered Species Act to a commercial real estate project that threatened a protected toad. Two others sided with people mounting job discrimination lawsuits. In his long career on the bench and as a Justice Department official before that, Garland developed a reputation for being pro-prosecutor and pro-government. But in his listing of significant opinions, he includes one case in which he voted to throw out a criminal conviction for a drug trafficking conspiracy, a second dissenting opinion in which he would have allowed lawsuits to continue against private contractors over allegations of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and a third that sided with a Uighur detainee at Guantanamo Bay who challenged his status as an \"enemy combatant.\" He also cites his role as a federal prosecutor Oklahoma City bombing and Unabomber cases as a lawyer before becoming a judge, noting that both were convicted. McVeigh was executed, while Kaczynski was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In the thousands of pages of documents, he also lists details of his work experience, his biographical background, his memberships and associations, his most significant cases, pro bono work and financial information. Garland reported that he was first called by the White House about the Supreme Court vacancy on Feb. 29 -- 16 days after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. He said he was interviewed by President Barack Obama on March 9, a week before Obama announced his nomination. The White House said the questionnaire is intended to present \"an exhaustive picture\" of Garland's service on the bench and of his \"impeccable credentials.\" The questionnaire is a standard early step in the vetting of any judicial nominee. The lengthy survey typically is drafted by the committee, completed by the nominee, and then reviewed and made public by the committee in advance of committee hearings. In this case, the Senate Judiciary Committee didn't send a questionnaire to Garland because Republicans said they have no intention of acting on his nomination. So the White House had Garland fill out what it described as a standard form and sent it, unsolicited, to the committee. So in Garland's atypical nomination, the questionnaire has become another tool in the White House pressure campaign. Senate Republicans have maintained that the next president should choose the Scalia's replacement. Shortly after the questionnaire was posted online, Senate Democrats used it to call once more on Republicans to hold hearings and vote. In a news conference, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee warned Republicans that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump could pick the next justice. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin joked that Trump might bring television personality Judge Judy out of retirement. \"I don't want to make light of the situation because it's extremely serious,\" Durbin said. \"But imagining Donald Trump picking a Supreme Court justice is something I never thought would cross my mind.\" Garland has been meeting privately with senators on so-called courtesy visits and conducted some prep sessions with the White House. He was scheduled to meet Tuesday with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, the White House said. \"We expect that upon receiving the questionnaire, Senate Judiciary Committee members will do their jobs by reviewing the information, scheduling a hearing so that the American people can hear directly from Chief Judge Garland as he answers questions under oath, and giving him a fair up or down vote,\" Hoffine said. Garland plans to continue his meetings with lawmakers this week. Garland is slated to meet Wednesday with Democratic Sens. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Tom Carper of Delaware, then Thursday with Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the White House said.",

            "article_content": "Strategy Room: Jeanne Zanio and Brian Morgenstern weigh in on Sanders' attempt to unseat DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz As one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was expected to have an easy 2016 re-election race \u2013 then along came Bernie Sanders. In a matter of days, the firebrand presidential candidate has elevated the Democratic National Committee chairwoman\u2019s Florida race from just another local primary to a nationalized battle -- and an offshoot of Sanders\u2019 fight against the Democratic Party itself. Sanders, who long accused Wasserman Schultz of working against his campaign, escalated that feud over the weekend by endorsing her primary challenger, Tim Canova, and then helping him fundraise. Analysts still see Canova as a longshot bid to topple Wasserman Schultz and deny her a seventh House term. But Sanders\u2019 intervention has given the challenger a much bigger profile, and already is helping him raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. Canova -- a law professor and first-time candidate touting such progressive ideals as Wall Street and campaign finance reform -- boasted Monday that Sanders\u2019 small-dollar fundraising blast brought in roughly $250,000. \u201cLike Bernie, we are running a campaign that is funded by working Americans, not corporations or wealthy elites,\u201d Canova said. \u201cOur political and economic systems are rigged in favor of the billionaire class and establishment politicians like Wasserman Schultz.\u201d Speaking Monday afternoon with Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto, Canova said, \u201cShe\u2019s concerned about her re-election and she should be.\u201d In announcing his endorsement over the weekend, Sanders initially told CNN he\u2019s backing Canova because \u201chis views are much closer to mine than to Wasserman Schultz's.\" But he pulled no punches when it came to the incumbent, making clear that if elected he\u2019d fire her as DNC chairwoman. In his Canova fundraising email, he said: \"The political revolution is not just about electing a president, sisters and brothers.\u201d The comments complicate what otherwise should have been an easy re-election for Wasserman Schultz, a stalwart fundraiser and 11-year House incumbent. Washington Republicans, within hours of Canova\u2019s statement, also tried to capitalize on Sanders\u2019 efforts. \u201cAs Sanders boosts far-left candidates who share his socialist vision of higher taxes and bigger government, he is forcing Democrats to move even further to the left \u2026 rendering their candidates unelectable,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Bob Salera. However, Republicans may stand less of a chance at taking the 23rd District seat \u2013 held by Democrats since it was created in 1990 \u2013 than Canova. No Republican candidate has officially entered the race, though a Washington GOP source told FoxNews.com that several potential candidates are considering a run. Whether Wasserman Schultz survives her Aug. 30 primary is a factor. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report and other analysts handicapping the race have long had her safely in the win column, and haven\u2019t changed their assessment yet. Dave Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook report, said Monday that Wasserman Schultz is \u201cnot very\u201d vulnerable, despite the Sanders\u2019 attack \u2013 which can be traced back to accusations that she limited the number of primary debates to protect the front-running Hillary Clinton. \u201cThere will certainly be a groundswell of contributions and national interest, but his race really depends on voters in her district,\u201d said Dave Wasserman, pointing out that the congresswoman won re-election in 2014 with over 60 percent of the vote. \u201cThose voters are not succumbing to the Bernie Sanders movement,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s well known to many voters beyond her job as chairwoman. Many know her personally.\u201d Still, Sanders and Republican Donald Trump surged in their respective White House campaigns by knocking their opponents as Washington insiders. Trump defeated 16 rivals \u2013 mostly sitting or former officials -- in the GOP primary to become the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Sanders has taken Clinton to the final weeks of Democratic primary with an insurgent campaign that continues to portray the former secretary of state as a Washington and Wall Street insider. He could employ similar tactics to boost Canova. Wasserman Schultz, though, responded to Sanders\u2019 intervention by saying she remains neutral in the Democratic presidential primary and is confident about her own chances. \"I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress,\" Wasserman Schultz, who was recently endorsed by President Obama, said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "FILE - In this May 27, 2015 file photo, Democratic presidential candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks in Columbia, S.C. Editor's note: The authors of the following column are all supporting Donald Trump for president. We are concerned about the egregious damage that has been inflicted on two revered government agencies: the Department of Justice and Department of State.\u00a0 The primary missions of both have been derailed for political purposes. The Department of Justice has been thwarted by its top officials\u2019 refusal to conduct a proper investigation of former Secretary Clinton\u2019s unsecured email server and the Pay for Play accusations based on millions of dollars paid to President Clinton personally and the Clinton Foundation by entities having issues before the State Department, all while she was Secretary. Attorney General Lynch and former President Clinton met on the Phoenix, Arizona tarmac days before Secretary Clinton was to be interviewed by the FBI for possible criminal activity.\u00a0 It has been reported that her staff ordered witnesses not to take pictures and no one was present during their 39-minute conversation. General Lynch never recused herself from decisions on the Clinton investigation after her self-admitted \u201cmistake,\u201d as it has also been reported that she continues to deny the FBI the authority to convene a Grand Jury, which is necessary for any meaningful investigation. Secretary Clinton\u2019s conduct at the Department of State corrupted our foreign policy. It has also been reported that General Lynch opposed Director Comey from fulfilling his obligation to Congress by informing members of the discovery of 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner\u2019s and Huma Abedin\u2019s computer, the existence of which had been concealed from government authorities. Recusal is a formal process.\u00a0 It is a written document specifically describing the scope of the recusal and designating the official in charge of the recused matter.\u00a0\u00a0 If General Lynch went through the proper procedure for recusal, she has not publicly shared it. Secretary Clinton\u2019s conduct at the Department of State corrupted our foreign policy.\u00a0 She and President Clinton turned the agency into a Pay for Play adjunct of the Clinton Foundation and their personal bank account, the latter via his personal \u201cspeaking\u201d fees.\u00a0 UBS, Switzerland\u2019s largest bank, contributed over $600,000 to the Foundation and loaned it over $30,000,000.\u00a0 UBS was grateful that Secretary Clinton had intervened in the IRS\u2019 demand to UBS to provide identities of 52,000 depositors.\u00a0 Secretary Clinton announced the settlement of only 4,450 identities in an \u201cunusual intervention by a top U.S. diplomat,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 UBS additionally paid President Clinton personally $1,500,000 for a series of questions and answers with top management. President Clinton reaped $6,200,000 personally from foreign governments and businesses for speeches while she was Secretary of State. For example, Ericsson, a Swedish corporation, had sanction issues pending before the State Department regarding telecom sales in certain countries. Ericsson paid President Clinton $750,000 for one speech. Days later the State Department announced the sanction list and Ericsson was not affected. Why should any spouse of a Secretary of State be permitted ever to receive one cent from a foreign entity? Because of our grave concern for integrity in government we ask for a Special Counsel.\u00a0\u00a0 When a high public official is accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the investigation be thorough, with dispatch and without partisanship. Secretary Clinton is the subject of two spheres of criminal conduct: her deliberate, systematic mishandling of official and classified emails and her abuse of a family-controlled, tax-exempt Foundation, and corporate and foreign donations for her own economic and political benefit. These allegations arose well before this election year. Clinton\u2019s mishandling of emails became public in March 2015, and allegations over abuse of the Foundation arose well before that.\u00a0 There has long been sufficient factual predicate to require these matters be fully investigated. The appropriate response when the subject matter is public and it arises in a highly-charged political atmosphere is for the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel of great public stature and indisputable independence to assure the public the matter will be handled without partisanship. In 1991-1992, a Special Counsel was appointed for three separate matters:\u00a0 House Bank, Iraqgate, and Inslaw.\u00a0 It was also done in 2003 in the Valerie Plame matter. Instead of moving with dispatch to ensure a vigorous investigation of Secretary Clinton, it appears that the Justice Department, along with State, have enabled the Clinton campaign to \u201cslow roll\u201d the inquiry. General Lynch continues to exert control of a matter that she should have assigned to another official. We are distressed by widespread and credible reports that FBI agents have been hindered by the Justice Department\u2019s withholding of basic investigative tools, such as grand jury subpoenas, which are fundamental in a complex investigation. It is time to do what should have been done long ago \u2013 appoint a Special Counsel. Rudolph W.

That\u2019s according to a just-released national Fox News Poll of likely voters. Clinton receives 45 percent to Trump\u2019s 38 percent. \u00a0Libertarian Gary Johnson is at 7 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein gets 3 percent. \u00a0Last week, Clinton was up by two points in the four-way contest (44-42 percent). In the two-way matchup, it\u2019s Clinton over Trump by eight (49-41 percent). \u00a0She had a four-point edge a week ago (48-44 percent, Oct. 3-6). Clinton\u2019s lead is outside the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error in both the two-way and four-way contests. The poll, out Thursday, was conducted Monday-Wednesday. \u00a0The second presidential debate was Sunday. On Friday, The Washington Post made public a hot-mic recording of Trump from Access Hollywood. \u00a0On the same day, WikiLeaks began its release of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign, revealing more on Monday through Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS In the four-way race, Clinton is favored among non-whites (+62 points), suburban women (+24), women (+19), and voters under 30 (+16). \u00a0Third party candidates hurt her among younger voters, as about one in four of them go for Johnson or Stein. Trump\u2019s the pick for men (+5 points), whites (+14), and whites without a college degree (+25). Since last week, the largest declines in support for him are among women ages 45 and over (down 12 points), voters ages 65+ (down 11), suburban women (down 10), white women with a college degree (down 7), GOP women (down 6), and white college graduates (down 6). Support for Trump among white evangelical Christians held steady at 68 percent. \u00a0Typically, however, about three-quarters of white evangelicals vote for the GOP nominee. \u00a0Trump\u2019s support among regular church-goers dropped eight points, from 53 to 45 percent. Independents split, giving 35 percent to each Clinton and Trump, with another 21 percent backing Johnson or Stein. \u00a0Trump was up by 12 points among independents in late September. Eighty-one percent of Democrats back Clinton and 80 percent of Republicans support Trump. \"If the Republicans are not at rock-bottom, they can certainly see the bottom from where they are,\" says GOP pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"If Trump got 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and nothing else -- no Democrats and no independents -- he'd be at 32 percent.\u201d Trump\u2019s enthusiasm advantage has evaporated: 70 percent of his backers \u201cstrongly\u201d supported him last week. \u00a0That\u2019s 63 percent now. \u00a0For Clinton, it\u2019s 66 percent, up from 57 percent. Yet the number of Republicans satisfied with Trump as their nominee is mostly unchanged: \u00a048 percent are happy with him at the top of the ticket vs. 52 percent a month ago. Among Democrats, 54 percent are happy with Clinton, while 38 percent still wish it were Bernie Sanders. Overall, 64 percent believe Clinton has the right temperament to serve effectively and 68 percent say she\u2019s qualified to be president. It\u2019s the opposite for Trump, as 63 percent think he lacks the temperament and 56 percent say he isn\u2019t qualified. \u00a0For 49 percent, he is \u201cnot at all\u201d qualified. Are the candidates good role models for children? \u00a0Voters say Clinton is (54 yes vs. 43 no). \u00a0And Trump is not (20 yes vs. 77 no). Thirty-three percent say Clinton is honest and trustworthy. \u00a0For Trump, it\u2019s 32 percent. \u00a0That\u2019s a four-point drop for him since last week. \u201cPut simply, the last week has been a disaster for Trump,\u201d says Anderson. \u00a0\u201cAnd more than ever, voters think he lacks the temperament and qualifications to be president.\u201d Trump\u2019s personal ratings also took a hit, while Clinton\u2019s improved. \u00a0More voters view her negatively than positively by five points (47 favorable vs. 52 unfavorable). \u00a0Last week she was underwater by nine. \u00a0Trump\u2019s rating stands at negative 23 (38 favorable vs. 61 unfavorable). \u00a0That\u2019s eight points more negative today, as he was underwater by 15 a week ago. Among Republicans, his favorable rating dropped 11 points, from 84 percent to 73 percent. Clinton now tops Trump on every issue tested. \u00a0More voters trust her to handle foreign policy (+24 points), health care (+13), terrorism (+11), immigration (+9), and the economy (+3). \u00a0For the past month, Trump had been the choice on the economy, and the two were about evenly matched on terrorism. Clinton is preferred to handle health care despite nearly half wanting to get rid of President Obama\u2019s signature law. \u00a0Forty-nine percent of registered voters want to repeal Obamacare vs. 45 percent who prefer to keep it in place. \u00a0That\u2019s a more positive rating for the law than the last time the Fox News Poll asked in December 2014. \u00a0Then it was 58 percent repeal and 38 percent keep. Meanwhile, a growing number expect another President Clinton. Sixty-five percent think she\u2019ll win in November. \u00a0That\u2019s 10 points higher than last week (55 percent) -- and 19 higher than June (46 percent). \u00a0Some 23 percent think Trump will win. Americans head to the polls in an even worse mood than four years ago. \u00a0In October 2012, 53 percent of registered voters were dissatisfied with how things were going in the country. \u00a0Now, 59 percent are dissatisfied. Even so, 56 percent approve of the job Barack Obama is doing as president. \u00a0That\u2019s up from 52 percent a week ago -- and a record high for his second term. \u00a0Moreover, his approval has been 48 percent or better since February. Pollpourri Trump\u2019s video troubles and subsequent attacks on GOP leaders are hurting the party. \u00a0One indication is more registered voters now consider themselves a Democrat than a Republican -- by nine points (44-35 percent), compared to by four points last week (41-37 percent). Democrats usually hold an advantage over Republicans nationally in party identification, and this year self-identified Democrats have outnumbered self-identified Republicans by an average of three percentage points in Fox News polls. The poll asks likely voters to choose between the Democratic and Republican candidates in their Congressional district and finds Democrats up by six points, 48-42 percent. \u00a0Democrats were up by just one at the end of September (44-43 percent). \"The Democrats are now prohibitive favorites to win the presidency, favorites to take the Senate, and it is no longer unthinkable that they could challenge in the House,\" says Shaw. Endorsing Trump is still a net positive for Congressional candidates: 27 percent of Republicans say they are more likely to vote for a Congressional candidate who refuses to endorse Trump, yet more -- 39 percent -- say they are less likely to do so. No matter who wins, voters are concerned scandals will have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on the administration: \u00a066 percent are worried about scandals in a Clinton administration and 63 percent if it\u2019s Trump. \u00a0More Democrats (54 percent) are concerned about scandals in a Clinton White House than Republicans are about a Trump administration (41 percent). Forty-eight percent of voters familiar with the video of Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks say it\u2019s a deal breaker for them. \u00a0Fifteen percent of Republicans and 40 percent of independents also feel that way. For comparison, 37 percent of voters familiar with Clinton\u2019s leaked emails say transcripts of her speeches to big Wall Street donors are a deal breaker. \u00a0That includes 11 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Sanders supporters. Trump\u2019s attacks on how Clinton has handled her husband\u2019s past controversies with women aren\u2019t sticking. \u00a0Seventy-two percent think Clinton \u201cstands up\u201d for women. \u00a0Thirty-eight percent say Trump \u201crespects\u201d women. The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 10-12, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 917 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Bill Clinton's top aide wrote that Chelsea Clinton used Clinton Foundation resources 'for her wedding and life for a decade,' according to emails released by WikiLeaks. Plus, Hillary Clinton asked her maid to print out classified info Former President Bill Clinton\u2019s top aide wrote in 2012 that Chelsea Clinton used Clinton Foundation resources \u201cfor her wedding and life for a decade\u201d and a top Foundation donor was responsible for \u201ckilling\u201d unfavorable press coverage \u2013 all as an internal Foundation audit uncovered numerous conflicts of interest and \u201cquid pro quo benefits,\u201d according to emails released Sunday by WikiLeaks. Doug Band, founder of global strategies company Teneo and Bill Clinton\u2019s personal assistant since the 1990s, wrote the Jan. 4, 2012, email to future Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chair John Podesta and two other Clinton aides after receiving word that Chelsea had told \u201cone of the [President] bush 43 kids\u201d and others about \u201can internal investigation of money within the foundation.\u201d Band wrote such chatter was \u201cnot smart.\u201d \u201cThe investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents\u2026.,\u201d Band wrote. \u201cI hope that you will speak to her and end this[.] Once we go down this road\u2026.\u201d EMAIL DETAILS HOW TOP AIDES MADE EX-PRESIDENT CLINTON RICH The FBI reportedly is looking into The Clinton Foundation, although the extent and focus of the investigation is unclear. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, had previously said some of the \u201cpersonal\u201d emails she deleted from her secret, homebrew server \u2013 the subject of another FBI probe \u2013 were related to Chelsea\u2019s wedding. Band\u2019s email, which was revealed after Podesta\u2019s Gmail account was hacked and subsequently uploaded to WikiLeaks, came at a time of turmoil and upheaval within The Clinton Foundation. Aside from the internal audit, previous emails show a prolonged effort to untangle Teneo from the Foundation. When Band launched the company in summer 2011, he was still employed by the Foundation and Bill Clinton was listed as a Teneo adviser. But after much haggling, Clinton\u2019s and Band\u2019s roles were clearly delineated: Band continued on as a personal aide to Clinton and Clinton became a Teneo client. During the back-and-forth that produced the final document spelling out each of the men\u2019s roles, Band on Nov. 12, 2011 wrote an 11-page memo outlining how Teneo was created and how it had helped to enrich Clinton and the Foundation. In that draft of the memo, Band wrote he had \u201csought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation.\u201d President Bill Clinton, left, walks with aide Doug Band. (Georgetown.edu) \u201cI am sure I have done so imperfectly,\u201d he added. In another section of the memo, which was later deleted, Band wrote about billionaire hedge fund manager Marc Lasry as a \u201cgood example of the complex relationships a friend/supporter can have within the foundation.\u201d Chelsea Clinton worked for Lasry, Lasry held Foundation fundraisers and Band was a paid adviser for Lasry\u2019s firm, Avenue Capital, an investment company whose holding American Media Inc. publishes The National Enquirer. But fundraisers and jobs weren\u2019t Lasry\u2019s lone contribution to Team Clinton. \u201cHe has been helpful on a number of fronts, including \u2026 responding favorably to our requests to use his plane for Foundation and the Clintons\u2019 personal purposes, killing potential unfavorable stories in the Enquirer [of which he owns a controlling share of the debt]\u2026\u201d Band wrote. Less than a month after Band\u2019s Teneo memo went out, lawyers from Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP, the firm contracted to run the internal Foundation audit, emailed a draft of a governance memorandum and recommendations to Podesta, who was serving as a special adviser to the Foundation, and Bruce Lindsey, then the Foundation\u2019s CEO. The audit draft noted substantial issues, including a Conflict-of-Interest Policy that had not been implemented, conflicts that were not disclosed in a timely fashion and board members not following the policy when they became aware of conflicts. \u201cIn addition, some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts,\u201d according to the Dec. 5, 2011, draft. Another section of the document noted that \u201cinterviewees also mentioned instances in which gifts and payments received by staff had not been properly disclosed.\u201d There were other problems, including 1,298 \u201ccomplimentary\u201d $20,000 memberships for the Clinton Global Initiative as opposed to just 500 paid memberships. Of the \u201ccomplimentary\u201d group, \u201c276 were coded \u2018discretionary,\u2019\u201d the audit noted. \u201cInterviewees informed us that there is no transparency into how the comp list is developed,\u201d the document stated. The lawyers conducting the audit also noticed problems in the Foundation\u2019s IRS Form 990, the tax return document of an organization that is exempt from income tax. While charitable groups are allowed to pay board members and staff a reasonable salary, none of the reasonable compensation calculations identified by the lawyers were ever done, the 990 form showed. The lawyers also wrote the 990 indicated the Foundation had a written conflict-of-interest policy that was enforced. \u201cHowever, we did not find evidence of that enforcement,\u201d the memo stated. Other problems included a \u201cvery small\u201d Foundation Board \u201ccomprised solely of \u2018insiders\u2019\u201d; unsigned Board minutes that \u201cappear to have been cloned from one year to the next; \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in the \u201csegregation of accounting duties, review of journal entries, audit adjustments and financial statement preparation, and lack of Board meetings.\u201d",

(Ocean County Jail via AP) LACEY, N.J.  \u2013 A man who wore a Hitler mustache and is believed by authorities to be a white supremacist faces numerous charges after authorities say they found a large cache of weapons and ammunition in the New Jersey woods. Lacey police say officers in a multi-agency task force were in the New Jersey Pinelands on Sunday afternoon looking for trespassers and criminal activity when they came across a suspicious vehicle. They soon found Bruce Post III, who they said was dressed in combat gear, and another man nearby. Post wore a short mustache centered over his top lip, just like the one associated with Adolf Hitler. Investigators found an AK-47, a 9mm handgun, eight 30-round magazines, a 100-round drum magazine and other ammunition in the woods. The items were found near the vehicle where the two men were discovered. Post, 42, who lives in the Trenton area, was charged with illegally possessing a weapon as a felon and several other weapons counts. His bail was set at $400,000 cash. It wasn't known Monday if Post has an attorney. A person who answered the phone at his home Monday afternoon hung up when they were asked if they had any comment on Post's arrest. The other man hasn't been charged. But authorities say the investigation is ongoing. Authorities say they believe Post is a white supremacist largely based on his violent criminal history and comments he made to officers. In addition to the Hitler mustache, he also was wearing German combat gear.",

            "article_content": "Speaker election postponed; Reaction on 'Outnumbered' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's stunning decision Thursday to withdraw from the race for speaker leaves Republicans scrambling to find that elusive candidate who can unite the divided conference and actually win a majority on the floor. The California Republican's abrupt withdrawal is a testament to how undesirable John Boehner's job really is. As GOP leader, McCarthy immediately was deemed the front-runner and was thought to have more than enough support to win the party nomination in a vote originally set for Thursday afternoon. Now, it's unclear whether more candidates will enter the race or whether the field will stand as is, with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., vying for the job. Thursday night, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., told Fox News he was putting himself out as a speaker candidate but \"I'd like to tell my wife first.\" Further adding to the turmoil, Fox News has confirmed Boehner personally tried to recruit Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to run for speaker. There was no immediate response from Ryan, but in a 2011 statement explaining why he wouldn't challenge Boehner for minority leader, he said, \"my first priority in life will always be my wife and my three young children.\" Earlier Ryan, the party's vice presidential nominee in 2012, \u00a0put out a statement saying he would not run for speaker and he was \"disappointed\" McCarthy dropped out. While the House sorts it out, Boehner says he intends to stay on as speaker until a successor is chosen, though he had planned to resign at the end of the month. \"I will serve as Speaker until the House votes to elect a new Speaker. We will announce the date for this election at a later date, and I'm confident we will elect a new Speaker in the coming weeks,\" Boehner said in a statement. Fox News is told that absent a new speaker, Boehner also would be prepared to stay on for the rest of the Congress and steer legislation that is pending. McCarthy's former rivals remain in the contest, though. Webster told Fox News on Thursday he still thinks he can \"bridge that gap\" in the conference. The conservative wing of the party indeed was gravitating toward Webster in the run-up to Thursday's meeting, and some lawmakers suggest he'll get a boost out of McCarthy's withdrawal. \"It might enhance Dan Webster's chances. Dan is a man of principle,\" Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., told FoxNews.com.\u00a0Webster won the backing of the conservative House Freedom Caucus before Thursday's meeting. But Chaffetz said he, too, is staying in the race. \"I really do believe it is time for a fresh start. That was the whole genesis of my campaign,\" he said. Other candidates could enter in the coming weeks. Speculation immediately will center on Republicans who had put their names forward for other leadership posts. While McCarthy says he's now staying on as majority leader, it was a job Reps. Steve Scalise, R-La., and Tom Price, R-Ga., had been planning to run for. Scalise was mum Thursday afternoon on whether he'd run for speaker now that McCarthy is out. Price put out a statement backing the idea of a caretaker speaker who can lead through the 2016 election, without stating his own intentions. \"Now is the time for our members to come together and have an honest conversation about how we unify our Conference,\" he said. \"The best course would be for us to select a candidate for Speaker who will serve in that capacity for the next 15 months. This would allow the House to complete the business in a responsible manner, providing ample time for everyone's voices to be heard, leading into full leadership elections in November of 2016.\" Other candidates initially thought to be in the mix for majority leader, for a short time, were Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. Both opted not to run, but it's unclear whether they might now consider the speaker race. Names that have been floated for a \"caretaker\" speaker also include Reps. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., and John Kline, R-Minn. Practically speaking, Republicans' overriding interest is to find a candidate who can muster an absolute majority on the House floor in a full chamber vote, originally set for Oct. 29. While McCarthy was likely to easily win the nomination, it was unclear whether he could muster a majority -- of roughly 218 members -- once lawmakers from both parties vote for speaker. For his part, McCarthy said he thinks the party needs a \"fresh face.\" \"If we are going to unite and be strong, we need a new face to help do that,\" McCarthy said. \"We've got to be 100 percent united.\" Democrats put the onus on Republicans to sort out the confusion after McCarthy's withdrawal. \"It's up to House Republicans to choose the next Speaker,\" Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement. FoxNews.com's Cody Derespina and Fox News' Bret Baier, Chad Pergram and Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ben Rhodes not allowed to testify before House lawmakers on nuclear deal Republican condemnation of a top White House aide who boasted about the administration\u2019s success selling the Iran deal to the public reached new levels on Tuesday, as several senators urged President Obama to fire him and a House committee looking into his claims went forward with its hearing \u2013 even though he didn\u2019t show up to testify. The House Oversight Committee hearing was called to examine White House \u201cnarratives\u201d on the Iran deal, after top adviser Ben Rhodes was featured in a New York Times Magazine profile claiming they built an \u201cecho chamber\u201d to sell the plan. Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, had called Rhodes to testify, but the White House shielded him from the appearance. Chaffetz, at the top of the hearing Tuesday, said \u201cthere\u2019s still a shroud of secrecy\u201d surrounding the Iran deal and he wanted to hear from Rhodes to seek \u201cclarity.\u201d \u201cI do not doubt his talents and his knowledge,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cBut the deal that had been spun up and sold to the American public, I\u2019m not sure it was as clear as it should have been.\u201d He said Rhodes, in the profile, showed \u201cdisdain\u201d for the media and foreign policy circles. Just hours earlier, the White House officially informed Chaffetz it would not make Rhodes available to testify, citing an executive privilege-related claim. Chaffetz did not go forward with plans to keep a seat open Tuesday for Rhodes, and instead called foreign policy analysts and scholars to testify on the deal. One of them, the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Michael Rubin, accused Rhodes of creating a \u201cpropaganda operation.\u201d The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., slammed Republicans for the hearing, criticizing the analysts they called while noting they didn\u2019t invite military generals who support the agreement. He said Republicans rushed to hold the hearing \u201cwithout even one week\u2019s notice.\u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said at least Cummings would be able to question the witnesses present. Rhodes, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t bother to show up.\u201d Meanwhile, several GOP senators have written to Obama urging him to \u201cdismiss\u201d Rhodes \u201cbefore he further tarnishes the Office of President.\u201d They wrote: \u201cWhile members of the Executive and Legislative branches may sometimes deeply disagree on issues of vital importance to our nation\u2019s security and prosperity, we should all agree, for the greater good of our Republic and the citizens whom we represent, to engage in our debates in a respectful, honest, and constructive manner.\u00a0Mr. Rhodes\u2019s disrespectful, deceptive, and destructive conduct has fallen appallingly short of this standard, however.\u00a0Indeed, if he had conducted himself this way in a typical place of business outside Washington, where American taxpayers work, he surely would have been already fired or asked to resign.\u201d The Washington Free Beacon, which first reported on the letter, said it was signed by Sens. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.; John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; and David Perdue, R-Ga. Sources tell Fox News that the House committee was keen for Rhodes to appear voluntarily Tuesday so they avoid the territory of a possible subpoena. The magazine article that touched off the controversy outlined how Rhodes created a narrative of the deal coming out of the 2013 election of \u201cmoderate\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Iran\u2019s subsequent \u201copenness\u201d and willingness to negotiate. In fact, the story stated, the majority of the deal was hammered out in 2012, well before Rouhani\u2019s election. However, the Rhodes narrative was politically useful to the administration as it presented them as reaching out to the moderates who wanted peace.",

            "article_content": "FBN's Charlie Gasparino weighs in Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton on Monday took a giant step toward letting Democratic voters know she\u2019s representing the progressive agenda, calling for tax increases and more regulation on Wall Street -- while making a play for a liberal base that has been gravitating toward Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cI know as much as anybody, the role Wall Street should play for main street,\u201d said Clinton, who vowed, if elected, to \u201crein in excessive risks\u201d and appoint regulators to \u201cprosecute firms and individuals\u201d who break the law. Clinton also vowed to increase taxes on large corporations and the country\u2019s highest wage-earners, an apparent effort to recapture her party\u2019s progressive base now captivated by surging primary challenger Sanders and the reformer agenda of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is not a 2016 candidate. Clinton specifically vowed to revive efforts to institute the so-called Buffet Rule, which is essentially a 30 percent \u201cmillionaire tax.\u201d \u201cThose at the top have to pay their share,\u201d Clinton said during her roughly 35-minute speech at the New School, a New York City college and bastion for progressive ideals. \u201cWealthy financiers pay artificially low tax rates.\u201d Clinton also called for minimum-wage increases and urged companies to expand profit-sharing of corporate earnings with workers. \u201cHard-working Americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they helped produce,\" she said. \"That will be good for workers and good for business. Studies show profit-sharing that gives everyone a stake in a company's success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees' pockets.\" The speech was greeted warmly on the left. \u201cClinton's economic policy speech reflects a very clear understanding that the Democratic Party and the vast majority of the American people want a president who will fight alongside \u2026 Warren and refuse to kowtow to wealthy and powerful interests on Wall Street,\u201d said Jim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America. \"Coupled with Senator Bernie Sanders' early 2016 surge, today's speech illustrates the dominate force the Elizabeth Warren wing is in the Democratic Party and the critical role it has already played in ensuring that income inequality\u00a0sits at the very center of the 2016 presidential debate.\" While top-tier Republican candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has called for an annual growth rate of 4 percent, Clinton asserted that the nation's economy should not be \u201ctethered\u201d to a specific growth figure but rather by how much income increases for middle-class households. Clinton called out Bush by name. And in her pitch to revive labor unions and their influence on increasing wages, she cited Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the latest GOP contender to enter the race, and suggested the entire Republican Party was trying to squash big labor. \u201cThey made their name stomping workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI will fight back against these mean-spirited attacks.\u201d Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said in response that Clinton also should have explained how she plans to pay for all the spending. \"Whether she tells us or not, though, it\u2019s pretty clear: she will have to raise taxes on American families,\" Moore said. \"If she doesn\u2019t raise taxes, then she will have to break her promises. That\u2019s Clintonomics: tax hikes or broken promises.\" Clinton also pointed to economic progress during her husband's two terms in the 1990s and more recently under President Obama. In Clinton's approach to the economy, she says more Americans would share in the prosperity and avoid the boom-and-bust cycles of Wall Street that have led to economic turbulence of the past decade. Clinton, who is seeking to become the nation's first female president, also addressed ways of making it easier for women to join the workforce -- including affordable child care and pay equal to their male counterparts FoxNews.com' Joseph Weber and Fox News' Ed Henry and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ivanka Trump opens up about her life as a top business executive, fashion designer, mother of three and daughter of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. The 2016 presidential campaign has been an exceptionally nasty one, filled with negative rhetoric, mudslinging and some very dirty politics. But last month at the Republican National Convention, a silver lining emerged from the storm clouds over Cleveland. We met the Trump Kids: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany \u2014 four young adults who would be the apple of any parent\u2019s eye. One by one, they infused a breath of fresh air into what has been a very depressing political season. They deserve our highest praise for their professional demeanor throughout the runup to their father\u2019s nomination \u2014 and especially at the convention, where they brought a personal, pragmatic and sincere tone to the often raucous proceedings. Their accomplishment was even more remarkable because of the adversity they faced as children. If it\u2019s true that adversity is the precursor of success, then the Trump Kids are the poster children for the adage. Donald Jr., 38, Ivanka, 34, and Eric, 32, are the children of Donald and Ivana Trump, whose 14-year marriage provided two years\u2019 worth of sensational and occasionally lurid tabloid headlines before they divorced in 1992. The kids attended boarding schools, but they were from New York, where it was impossible to avoid seeing their father\u2019s infidelity and their parents\u2019 rocky relationship displayed on every newsstand. The children were rich, but their childhood was tumultuous. They could easily have gone down the wrong path. But if it\u2019s true that adversity is the precursor of success, then the Trump Kids are the poster children for the adage. Donald Jr., married with five children, is a real estate developer and executive vice president of the Trump Organization. Ivanka, married with three children, is a celebrated businesswoman, author and model. Eric, who married in 2014, is executive vice president of the Trump Organization, the owner of Trump Winery and founder of the foundation that bears his name. Despite their father\u2019s often abrasive rhetoric, they \u2014 plus Tiffany, the 22-year-old daughter of Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples \u2014 have been articulate, quiet supporters. And all four delivered speeches in Cleveland this week that could establish them as leaders of their generation. The Trump kids\u2019 spouses have also become an important swatch of the family fabric \u2014 especially Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who has become a trusted adviser to his father-in-law and no doubt will be an important part of the Trump campaign going forward. Ivanka herself, meanwhile, has been described as \u201cthe quiet power behind the Trump throne\u201d \u2014 and she more than proved it at the Republican convention when she stood before thousands to introduce her father. She was elegant, dignified and confident. Her speech was a brilliant testament to the values her father instilled in all four of his adult children. The Trump kids, like their father, are a force to contend with. Being born into wealth is fate, and the Trump kids obviously had privileges and an access to resources that most kids didn\u2019t have. But it\u2019s what youngsters do with their resources that builds their destiny. The Trump kids have already had a tremendous impact on their father\u2019s campaign. As Trump approached the announcement of his running mate, the kids flew to Indiana on an \u201cintervention\u201d mission to ensure he didn\u2019t make an impulsive decision. Donald Trump clearly values his kids\u2019 opinion, and he knows they will voice it tactfully, not publicly. He also values his kids\u2019 independence, as evidenced by Ivanka\u2019s conversion to her husband\u2019s Orthodox Jewish faith, an assimilation that was apparently seamless. Every leader talks about the future of America, but we seldom hear from the next generation of leaders during an election cycle. In the last 24 years our three most recent presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, came to the White House with children too young to take an active role in the White House. So it\u2019s been unusual to see a candidate\u2019s children go front and center. Certainly, this is the first time in a generation that we\u2019ve seen it happen at a party convention. Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Jared Kushner and the entire Trump team deserve congratulations for their magnificent performance in Cleveland. Perhaps they will inspire their generation to get involved in our country\u2019s future. And with any luck, we\u2019ll be saying the same thing in 20 or so years about another kid: Barron Trump, Donald and Melania Trump\u2019s 10-year-old son. For the time being, no matter what your feelings may be about Donald Trump, can we all agree on this? If good kids are the yardstick by which one measures good parents, then Donald Trump and his wives have done remarkably well.",

            "article_content": "First presidential votes counted as Election Day begins at midnight Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton started off neck-and-neck in the 2016 presidential election, as Trump won over the voters of three New Hampshire precincts early Tuesday morning, 32-25. Polls opened and shut quickly in the tiny hamlets of Dixville Notch, Hart\u2019s Location and Millsfield just after midnight Tuesday. Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. Clinton won more votes in Dixville Notch and Hart\u2019s Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield, with a 16-4 advantage. Libertarian Gary Johnson picked up three votes. Bernie Sanders, John Kasich and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got write-ins. The traditional early vote in New Hampshire kicked off what promises to be a busy election day, after Trump and Clinton visited key battleground states late Monday into early Tuesday to make one last plea to American voters. Speaking in Grand Rapids, Mich., Trump urged voters to ask themselves before they entered the voting booth: \u201cDo you want America to be ruled by the corrupt political class or do you want America to be ruled by the people?\u201d \u201cToday is our independence day, today the American working class is going to strike,\u201d he added. Clinton visited North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C. for a midnight rally. Clinton was led in by performances from Jon Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga and then by her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea. \u201cTomorrow night this election will end but I want you to understand that our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country.\u201d Clinton also made her final plea to middle class voters. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time, it\u2019s the kind of country we want, every issue so if you believe America thrives when middle class thrives then you have to vote, if you believe,\u201d she added. Clinton\u2019s speech in Raleigh echoed her entire trip Monday as she made her final campaign stops in key states. Clinton vowed to unite a divided nation. \u201cAnger is not a plan,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said in Pittsburgh, Pa. As Clinton spent the day blasting what she called her opponent\u2019s \u201cdivisive vision\u201d for America, Trump blamed her and her husband\u2019s policies for manufacturing job losses and vowed a change if he\u2019s elected. \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you. We\u2019re going to bring back wealth taken from this country,\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, said in battleground state North Carolina, the second of his five stops Monday. Trump began his day in Florida before heading to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He pulled out all the stops at the second to last rally of his campaign in Manchester, New Hampshire. Trump appeared with his running mate Mike Pence and many members of his family at the SNHU Arena, the same arena where he held his final rally before the New Hampshire primary. His win in that race paved his way to the party's nomination. \"It all began for me in New Hampshire,\" Trump said after taking the stage. The race remains tight hours before voting gets underway. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows Trump\u2019s prospects improving in four key states -- Arizona, Iowa, Utah and North Carolina \u2013 though Clinton still has the advantage on the electoral map. Clinton returned to the campaign trail Monday, less than 24 hours after the FBI concluded a revived probe into her personal email use as secretary of state, lifting a cloud off her campaign in the final hours as she seeks to become the first woman elected president in U.S. history. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time,\u201d Clinton said at her first rally, in Pittsburgh. \u201cWill we come together as a nation or split further apart? \u2026 We don\u2019t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive big-hearted America.\u201d Before embarking on her three-state campaign swing, Clinton told reporters that she has \"some work to do to bring the country together\" and that she wants to be president for those who vote for her and those who don't. Clinton after Pennsylvania went to battleground state Michigan before planning to return for an event in Philadelphia, then a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Trump on Monday resumed his breakneck race through the country to make a final appeal to voters to help him \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. In the wake of the FBI announcement, he urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box.\" On Sunday, Trump and running mate Mike Pence held events in seven states, with the last starting after midnight in Virginia. \u201cShe wants to fight ISIS?\u201d Trump said Monday in North Carolina about Clinton, who has essentially led for the entire 2016 election cycle. \u201cShe wants to fight nobody. She\u2019s got no chance.\u201d Trump is aiming for an upset victory Tuesday, which is still possible if he is able to win key toss-up states and pick off one or more strategic states considered Democratic territory. The former reality TV star shocked the country\u2019s political class this spring when he defeated 16 major candidates in the Republican primaries, among them several senators and governors. While seeking victories in the so-called battleground states, which have a mix of voters who could go for either major party candidate, Pennsylvania is considered critical for Trump. The state has not elected a GOP presidential nominee since 1988 in the candidates\u2019 race to get 270 Electoral College votes. Early voting in other battleground states suggests Clinton is leading among Hispanics, a key voting bloc. However, the African-American vote does not appear as strong for her as it was in 2008 and 2012 when black voters helped elect and re-elect Barack Obama. The Justice Department said Monday that it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That's a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago, amid Trump\u2019s persistent warning about potential voter fraud at polling stations. Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. The announcement also came amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.

            "article_content": "July 22, 2016: Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke registers his candidacy for the November 8 ballot as a Republican at the Louisiana Secretary of State's office in Baton Rouge, La. (AP) BATON ROUGE, La. \u2013 Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, an avowed white supremacist, officially signed up Friday to run for U.S. Senate in Louisiana, saying \"the climate of this country has moved in my direction.\" \"I believe my time has come,\" Duke said after submitting his paperwork for the ballot. He added: \"The people of this country, the patriotic, decent, God-fearing people of this country are now right with me.\" Duke's candidacy comes one day after Donald Trump accepted the GOP nomination for president, and Duke said he's espoused principles for years that are similar to the themes Republicans are now supporting in Trump's campaign, on issues such as immigration and trade. He said the majority of Americans are \"embracing the core issues I have fought for my entire life.\" The launch of Duke's campaign also comes as the state is grappling with deep racial tensions after the shooting death of a black man by white police officers and the killing of three law enforcement officers by a black man. Duke said he was \"shattered\" by the slayings of police and said they were \"one of the things that tipped me to going for this race.\" In a lengthy speech, Duke talked of the \"massive racial discrimination going on right now against European Americans,\" and what he called a biased media working against him. He described the Black Lives Matter movement as a \"terrorist organization.\" He said his slogan remains \"America first.\" A registered Republican, Duke is seeking an open seat vacated by Republican David Vitter. Nearly two dozen candidates have signed up for the Senate race. The seat is open because Vitter decided not to seek re-election on the Nov. 8 ballot. Republicans at the state and federal level quickly denounced Duke's Senate bid. Roger Villere, chairman of the Republican Party of Louisiana, said in a statement the party \"will play an active role in opposing\" him. \"The Republican Party opposes, in the strongest possible terms, David Duke's candidacy for any public office. David Duke is a convicted felon and a hate-filled fraud who does not embody the values of the Republican Party,\" Villere said Friday. Ward Baker, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Louisiana voters have several GOP candidates \"who will have a great impact on the Bayou State and the future of our country.\" \"David Duke is not one of them. He will not have the support of the NRSC under any circumstance,\" Baker said in a statement. Duke is a former state representative who represented suburban New Orleans for a single term more than two decades ago and was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress. His failed bid for governor in the 1991 race against former Gov. Edwin Edwards -- who was later convicted of corruption -- was one of Louisiana's most high-profile elections, with Duke opponents proudly showing bumper stickers supporting Edwards that read \"Vote for the crook. It's important.\" In a posting on his website, Duke said he'd been \"urged by enormous numbers of people\" in his district to run for United States Congress. \"With the country coming apart at the seams and no one willing to really speak the truth about what is happening, the majority population in this country needs someone who will actually give voice to their interests in the face of an increasingly violent hatefest launched by the media and political establishment against them,\" Duke's website says. Duke, a convicted felon, pleaded guilty in 2002 to bilking his supporters and cheating on his taxes. He spent a year in federal prison, but later denied any wrongdoing.",

            "article_content": "On 'America's Newsroom,' Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the controversy over actions toward a company tied to Chelsea's husband Hedge fund manager Marc Mezvinsky had friends in high places when he bet big on a Greek economic recovery, but even the keen interest of his mother-in-law, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wasn't enough to spare him and his investors from financial tragedy. In 2012, Mezvinski, the husband of Chelsea Clinton, created a $325 million basket of offshore funds under the Eaglevale Partners banner through a special arrangement with investment bank Goldman Sachs. The funds have lost tens of millions of dollars predicting that bailouts of the Greek banking system would pump up the value of the country\u2019s distressed bonds. One fund, exclusively dedicated to Greek debt, suffered near-total losses. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in 2013 to run for president. But newly released emails from 2012 show that she and Clinton Foundation consultant, Sidney Blumenthal, shared classified information about how German leadership viewed the prospects for a Greek bailout. Clinton also shared \u201cprotected\u201d State Department information about Greek bonds with her husband at the same time that her son-in-law aimed his hedge fund at Greece. That America\u2019s top diplomat kept a sharp eye on intelligence assessing the chances of a bailout of the Greek central bank is not a problem. However, sharing such sensitive information with friends and family would have been highly improper. Federal regulations prohibit the use of nonpublic information to further private interests or the interests of others. The mere perception of a conflict of interest is unacceptable. Through its press representative, Eaglevale declined to comment for this story. Clinton\u2019s campaign press office did not respond to a request for comment. A former Goldman Sachs broker himself, Mezvinsky formed Eaglevale Management with two ex-Goldman Sachs partners in October 2011. As a \u201cglobal macro\u201d firm, Eaglevale\u2019s strategy is to seek profit opportunities in politically volatile situations. Mezvinsky set up several funds in the Cayman Islands, a secretive tax haven, with Goldman Sachs serving as Eaglevale\u2019s prime broker and banker. The giant brokerage firm has a checkered history of manipulating the value of Greek debt to the detriment of Greece. The same month that Eaglevale incorporated its offshore arm, Gary Gensler, the head of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which polices hedge funds, emailed Clinton that a bailout by the European Central Bank could \u201cturn market sentiment\u201d in favor of Greek bonds. Gensler had previously worked as co-head of finance at Goldman Sachs; he is now the financial director of Clinton\u2019s election campaign. Goldman Sachs has donated up to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and $860,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s political campaigns. Shortly after Clinton resigned, Goldman Sachs paid her $675,000 in speaking fees. Clinton\u2019s deputy in charge of economic policy was Robert Hormats, a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs. Hormats and Clinton shared an extensive email trail about the possibility of bailing out Greece, including classified materials, and internal state department memos about the debt from the U.S. ambassador to Greece. June 15: Demonstrators gather in front of the Parliament in Athens' main Syntagma square. (AP) Again, monitoring Greece was part of Clinton\u2019s job description, but, ethically, that does not mean that a family member should make bets that depend upon the actions of another family member\u2014leaving aside the question of whether \u201cinsider\u201d information was divulged to Mezvinsky by Blumenthal or his parents-in-law. During 2011, Secretary of State Clinton lobbied the leaders of European governments to bail out the Greek financial system. She advocated imposing austerity measures on Greece\u2014raising taxes, cutting public employee salaries and eliminating social welfare programs\u2014to make the investors holding the debt happy. Driven by investor\u2019s belief that Greece would be bailed out, the speculative value of its debt climbed into the stratosphere in late 2011 and early 2012. The bonds gradually sank to 2008 levels by the end of the year, with temporary spikes, as investors alternately gained and loss confidence in the prospect of a bailout. In other words, there were multiple opportunities for Greek-bond hedge funds to buy cheap and sell dear. At a February 2012 summit meeting about the Eurozone debt crisis in Munich, Clinton urged leaders of the European Union to commit to a Greek bailout. In April, Eaglevale booked $19 million from a dozen investors. California\u2019s public employee pension fund, CalPERS, reportedly invested $13 million. Goldman Sach\u2019s CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, jumped in with his own money, as did Chelsea Clinton\u2019s former boss, Marc Lasry, who specializes in buying distressed debt. In May, Blumenthal, emailed two \u201cconfidential\u201d memos about the Greek debt situation to Clinton. Hormats was included in the email loop. The first memo, Blumenthal told Clinton, is \u201cbased on conversations with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble and those close to him \u2026 the information comes from an extremely sensitive source and should be handled with care. This information must not be shared with anyone associated with the German government.\u201d The unnamed spy reported that in secret meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Schauble had searched for a politically acceptable way to bail out the Greek debt in order to avoid collapsing the economies of Greece, Italy, Spain and Ireland. The second memo was classified and blacked out by State Department censors when Clinton\u2019s emails were released. No doubt, it was informative. In June, Clinton\u2019s deputy, Jake Sullivan emailed her \u201ca depressing snapshot\u201d of reports that Greek banks were failing and that Merkel was against a Greek bailout. The next day, he reported \u201cre: Greece\u201d that Ambassador Dan Smith \u201cjust spoke to the Central Bank Governor and assessed that the economic situation was \u201cok for now\u201d provided that \u201csmall depositors put money back into the banks.\u201d A few days later, Clinton asked Sullivan for a confidential state department report, \u201cSolidarity Bonds Greece Revised.\u201d He sent it to her adding, \u201cIf you like, send it on [to] WJC,\" presumably a reference to William Jefferson Clinton. Clinton ordered an aide, \u201cPls print two copies\u201d of the Greek bond report. The report was blacked out as a \u201cprotected\u201d document when the emails were made public. Did Mezvinsky benefit from his family connection? The emails show that Clinton did at least one official favor for her son-in-law. In August 2012, she forwarded Deputy Secretary Thomas Nides an email from Mezvinsky lobbying on behalf of his former Goldman Sachs colleague, Harry Siklas. Siklas and Goldman Sachs were invested in a deep sea mining venture called Neptune Minerals. Siklas asked Mezvinsky to broker a talk with Clinton about \u201ccurrent legal issues and regulations\u201d on deep sea mining. Clinton ordered Nides to \u201cfollow up on this request.\u201d Nides replied, \u201cI\u2019ll get on it.\u201d",

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 The five stages of a Trumptation \u2022 AEHQ: In Depth on ISIS \u2022 Hillary doesn\u2019t mind big banks when they write big checks \u2022 As Friday shutdown looms, funding talks hit a snag \u2022 Sir, why are your socks buzzing? THE FIVE STAGES OF A TRUMPTATIONA Trumptation \u2013 that moment when the GOP frontrunner becomes the total focus of the political press based on an intentional provocation \u2013 has a well-defined lifecycle.Stage One: Donald Trump has a fever and there\u2019s only one cureIn the case of this week\u2019s outrage, Donald Trump\u2019s problem was that he was not getting enough attention in the wake of the attacks in San Bernardino and the president\u2019s Oval Office address. Trump was not only out of the limelight, but he suddenly found himself for the first time ever trailing his new chief adversary, Sen. Ted Cruz, in an Iowa poll. The discussion on Monday and Tuesday was all about Obama. And not in a good way. The president\u2019s decision to tack five minutes of partisan palaver onto the end of his address to the nation had opened wide the door to criticism of his tone and his policies. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was trapped in his orbit and one could start to see how 2016 could be a referendum on Obama\u2019s record on Islamist terrorism. Part of Obama\u2019s partisan punch was that Americans should resist calls for broad-based discrimination on religious grounds. The response from the GOP was a collective scoff. Republicans said they were focused on killing the members of ISIS and improving terror safeguards, not religious discrimination. Obama, Republicans said, was just trying to distract from his own failures. And then Trump arrived to turn Obama from partisan to prophet.Stage Two: Mutual interest prevailsAssume that what Trump and almost all Republicans believe about the press is true and that under every blouse and suitcoat is a Hillz for Prez t-shirt. Assume also that these same journalists are desperate for ratings or clicks. If Trump offers them a controversy that will both drive attention and help Democrats, how could they say no? A journalist might feel bad about such feverish coverage of any candidate unless they thought it was actually good for the country. If you\u2019re on the Trump train, then it\u2019s easy. Trump it up. And if you\u2019re a liberal Democrat who thinks that it would be very bad for any Republican to win, it\u2019s easy too. Wall-to-wall coverage of the Republican frontrunner calling for the federal government to institute religious tests is not just good business, but it\u2019s also patriotic. Light \u2018em up. As Trump learned in his birther endeavor in 2011, there\u2019s lots of attention to be had in living up to the caricature Obama has drawn of Republicans.Stage Three: The inquisitionNow, it\u2019s not like America will or can start making people swear religious oaths. What would immigration officials do? Demand visitors eat bacon sandwiches? But if you\u2019re a Republican being interviewed by the media on any topic under the sun --\u00a0 from terrorism to tax policy -- you can expect the interview to immediately turn into an interrogation about that thing Donald Trump said. This one is ripe enough that it has been easy and direct for most in the party to disown and denounce. Even Trump\u2019s cleanup \u2013 excepting Muslim military personnel, etc. \u2013 hasn\u2019t sufficiently confused the issue to create many traps. Fear of a Trump backlash isn\u2019t what it used to be. The backlash is continual so his rivals can at least try to get in on the upside. As always, Cruz plays it a little differently. Cruz differed with the policy but in keeping with his 12th Commandment \u2013 Thou shalt not speak ill of the Trump \u2013 Cruz declined to offer his opinion on the Muslim ban itself or Trump\u2019s rhetoric. It\u2019s what you could call a vulture\u2019s good manners. It is uncouth to denigrate your dinner.Stage Four: Hardening heartsTrump faces long odds for the nomination, made longer by this kind of conduct. The more dangerous he becomes to not just the Republican Party\u2019s prospects in the next election but future as a viable opposition party \u2013 a generational catastrophe that Paul David Miller compares to the Agrarian Revolt that wrecked Democrats \u2013 the more urgent the effort will be to unite against him. Trump has one hope, which has been his best hope all along: Jeb Bush. While Bush strives to be the last man standing against Trump, Trump no doubt wishes for the same thing. Bush\u2019s PAC man, Mike Murphy, has started what promises to be a very ugly and very profitable (at least for him) effort to tear down Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio, even as the latter increasingly rates as the party\u2019s best-liked figure and best hope to defeat Hillary Clinton. Bush isn\u2019t exactly a furnace of potential these days, but maybe he can claw his way over Rubio and give Trump a chance to stage a hostile takeover of the GOP. So while you can\u2019t count Trump out, the urgency in the efforts for Republicans to unite and defeat him is intensifying. Candidates weighing whether to drop out, donors waiting for the signal to jump in and undecided voters all have more reasons to get going today than they did on Monday. Those who felt indulgent toward Trump or maybe even a little Trump-curious themselves will increasingly join the ranks of the opposed, if only for electoral purposes.Stage Five: In the trenchesIf you liked Trump when he was receptive to a reporter\u2019s suggestion that Muslims be registered with the government, you wouldn\u2019t like him any less today. If you believed in Trump when he was calling for the revival of \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d today is not the day that you walk out. If you agreed when Trump said that perhaps a Black Lives Matter protester should have been \u201croughed up,\u201d this is far from the end of the line for you. If anything, today will be another baptism by fire for the Trump nation. They will not abandon their man, especially when he is under attack by the liberal media. And this is the real genius of Trump\u2019s method. He seeks negative attention from the press which then helps reinforce his message to his supporters: That they are under siege and fighting together. Many of Trump\u2019s backers feel under siege anyway, and by more than just reporters. They are facing a broken economy, an unraveling culture and a future that looks increasingly grim for themselves and their country. Going down fighting doesn\u2019t sound so bad to them. For now, the cycle works well for both Trump and his media frenemies. It remains to be seen whether it will work so well for his committed supporters.AEHQ: In Depth on ISIS - Tonight on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d the \u201cAEHQ: In Depth\u201d series dives deep into the 2016 candidates\u2019 stances on terror, especially relating to how to combat ISIS.

Born this day in 1894, Thurber would rise from his humble, Midwestern roots to become one of the 20th century\u2019s great humorists, and foundational writer at the New Yorker, thanks in part to Thurber\u2019s lifelong friend E.B. White. The Paris Review\u2019s 1955 interview with Thurber asked him how he managed to craft his unique brand of humor. Thurber answered, \u201cWith humor you have to look out for traps. You\u2019re likely to be very gleeful with what you\u2019ve first put down, and you think it\u2019s fine, very funny. One reason you go over and over it is to make the piece sound less as if you were having a lot of fun with it yourself. You try to play it down. In fact, if there\u2019s such a thing as a New Yorker\u00a0style, that would be it \u2013 playing it down.\u201dGot a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

            "article_content": "More than 800 illegal immigrants from countries of concern who were set for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship because the Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t have their fingerprints on file, according to an internal audit released Monday. The Homeland Security Department\u2019s inspector general found the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration. In the case of 858 immigrants from \"special interest countries or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud,\" the discrepancies weren\u2019t caught because their fingerprints were missing from government databases. A few even managed to get aviation or transportation worker credentials, though they were later revoked. One became a law enforcement officer. The findings were released, incidentally, as authorities were investigating a string of weekend attacks, allegedly connected to foreign-born suspects. The inspector general report could further fuel warnings about immigration security. The report warned that when immigrants become naturalized, \"these individuals retain many of the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship, including serving in law enforcement, obtaining a security clearance, and sponsoring other aliens\u2019 entry into the United States.\" The tally in the report was provided by the administration in mid-2014. But the problem could be even worse. According to the audit, as of November 2015, the administration has found 953 more \"who had final deportation orders under another identity and had been naturalized,\" some of whom were from countries of concern. DHS Inspector General John Roth also\u00a0found fingerprints missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants' files to add fingerprints to the digital record. \u201cThis situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,\u201d Roth said. \u201cTo prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, USCIS needs access to these fingerprint records.\u201d Roth added that DHS has agreed to the recommendations made in the audit and that ICE has plans to \u201creview the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal a deportation order under a different identity.\u201d The gap in fingerprints was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn't consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated. Roth's report said federal prosecutors have accepted two criminal cases that led to the immigrants being stripped of their citizenship. But prosecutors declined another 26 cases. ICE is investigating 32 other cases after closing 90 investigations. ICE officials told auditors the agency hadn't pursued many of these cases in the past because federal prosecutors \"generally did not accept immigration benefits fraud cases.\" ICE said the Justice Department has now agreed to focus on cases involving people who have acquired security clearances, jobs of public trust or other security credentials. Mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone ordered deported can have serious consequences because U.S. citizens can typically apply for and receive security clearances or take security-sensitive jobs. At least three of the immigrants-turned-citizens were able to acquire aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. Their credentials were revoked after they were identified as having been granted citizenship improperly, Roth said in his report. A fourth person is now a law enforcement officer. Roth recommended that all of the outstanding cases be reviewed and fingerprints in those cases be added to the government's database and that immigration enforcement officials create a system to evaluate each of the cases of immigrants who were improperly granted citizenship. DHS officials agreed with the recommendations and said the agency is working to implement the changes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bryan Pagliano at center of investigation into use of unsecured server at State Department More than 100 days after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying before the House committee investigating the Benghazi terrorist attack, a key Hillary Clinton aide is at the center of the separate and ongoing investigation by the FBI into Clinton\u2019s use of a private unsecured server while she was secretary of state. That former staffer, Bryan Pagliano, set up the controversial private email server in Clinton\u2019s home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Pagliano is believed to be the only witness publicly identified during the politically charged hearings on Benghazi to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He has not been charged with any crime, but the investigation continues into how Clinton used a private homebrew server which contained highly classified information\u00a0while she was secretary of state. As Fox News was first to report on Dec. 15, a review by the intelligence community reaffirmed that at least two emails were \u201ctop secret\u201d when they hit Clinton\u2019s private server. The State Department had challenged the classification. At the core of the separate FBI investigation is whether highly classified information was \"grossly mishandled\" by Clinton and her aides. Pagliano worked for the Clinton campaign team and was their trusted IT specialist before he joined the State Department in May 2009. As first reported by The Washington Post, the Clintons paid Pagliano $5,000 for \"computer services\" prior to his joining the State Department, according to a financial disclosure form he filed in April 2009. Yet, even after arriving at State in May 2009, Pagliano continued to be paid by the Clintons to maintain the non-secure homebrew server, which was located in a bathroom closet inside the Clinton's Chappaqua home. As part of invoking his Fifth Amendment right, Pagliano is also invoking the so-called act-of-production privilege. Since 1984, according to a review by Fox News, the privilege has been used in 103 federal or state cases. A person can invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against the production of documents only where the act of producing the documents is incriminating in itself.\u00a0According to a legal review by Fox News, this privilege applies when producing the documents \u2013 as opposed to their contents -- to the government is entitled to Fifth Amendment protection. This assertion is tantamount to the defendant's testimony that the documents exist, are authentic and are in his possession. The privilege has been invoked before by a Clinton associate. Webb Hubbell, Hillary Clinton's former law partner when she worked at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, argued for an\u00a0\"act-of-production privilege\" during the federal investigation into the collapse of Madison Guaranty, a failed savings and loan.\u00a0Hubbell followed Bill and Hillary Clinton into the White House to become an associate attorney general, the third-ranking member of the Justice Department. He was convicted in 1995 and served 18 months in federal prison for his role in the failure of that savings and loan which later became known as the \"Whitewater scandal.\" Pagliano initially invoked the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer 19 pages of questions from the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is investigating the attack that killed four Americans in September 2012.\u00a0Killed in the attack were Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department information officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Three months ago, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the committee, acknowledged that Pagliano may be called again.\u00a0Fox News has confirmed no new subpoena has yet been issued by the committee for Pagliano. And there has been no subpoena issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee. As for the ongoing and separate FBI investigation into Clinton's emails, no one is authorized to speak on the record but Fox News is told by two intelligence sources that the \"Bureau (FBI) has a solid team on the case\" and does not want to appear to be interfering with \"the country's political process.\" In addition to looking at the potential mishandling of classified material, investigators are focused on possible violations of U.S. Code 18, Section 1001 pertaining to \u201cmaterially false\u201d statements given either in writing, orally or through a third party. Each violation is subject to five years in prison. It is unclear if Pagliano also had to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement, or NDA, while working for the State Department which requires protection of highly classified information. Clinton signed her NDA on Jan. 22, 2009, which states in part, \"I have been advised that any breach of this Agreement may result in my termination of my access to SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information) and removal from a position of special confidence.\u201d In the prosecution of former CIA Director David Petraeus for his role in wrongly providing highly classified information to his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell, violations of Non-Disclosure Agreements were cited. Fox News was told that \u201cfrustration\u201d is mounting in the pace of the investigation into Clinton's emails. Mark MacDougall, the attorney for Pagliano, had no comment to Fox News.",

(AP Photo/Don Ryan, file) (The Associated Press) FILE--In this July 13, 2016, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum poses for a photo at her office in Portland, Ore. Erious Johnson, who is Rosenblum's director of civil rights, filed a federal lawsuit in Eugene, Ore., Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, against Rosenblum and others in her department over allegations of racial profiling. (AP Photo/Don Ryan, file) (The Associated Press) PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 Oregon's top civil rights lawyer filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against his boss and others in the state Department of Justice after learning that his colleagues surveilled his Twitter account because one of his posts turned up in a search for the Black Lives Matter hashtag. Erious Johnson, the department's civil rights director, said in the lawsuit that the January 2015 tweet included a picture of the logo of the hip-hop group Public Enemy. The logo depicts a black man in silhouette in the crosshairs of a gun, but a state investigator mistook the black man for a police officer and wrote to his supervisor that Johnson could be a threat to police, court papers say. That mistake led Johnson's colleagues within the department to compile a report on him and comb through his Twitter posts \u2014 all without his knowledge and while he continued to work alongside them, according to the lawsuit filed in Eugene, Oregon. In a separate civil rights complaint filed with the state earlier this year, Johnson said the surveillance wouldn't have happened \"had I not been a black male\" and \"had my Twitter activity involved matters other than the lives and experiences of black people.\" \"I have been subjected to racial discrimination and a hostile work environment for engaging in protected social media activity,\" Johnson wrote in his four-page complaint. He also noted: \"All of the individuals involved in perpetrating said racial discrimination and hostile work environment are Caucasian.\" An outside investigation ordered by state Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum earlier this year found that the surveillance activity violated state law and department policies. Rosenblum is running for re-election on Nov. 8. In a statement late Wednesday, spokeswoman Kristina Edmunson said Rosenblum considers Johnson a \"valued member of her inner-circle staff\" and had fired the state investigator who conducted the social media investigation. Two other agency officials involved in the scandal have been replaced and anti-bias training will begin in a week, Edmunson said. The incident began when the state investigator used a new computer program to search for social media posts in the Salem, Oregon area that included the hashtag Black Lives Matter and (expletive) the police. The investigator had received the new program and was testing it out, said Johnson's civil rights attorney, Beth Creighton. Johnson was only informed of the surveillance in October in a meeting with Rosenblum, who had become aware of the situation two weeks earlier and realized her investigators had overstepped. \"It's an incredible sense of betrayal. Now he's wondering what else they're looking into and who he can trust,\" said Creighton, his attorney. \"It's a really important thing to be able to trust people when you're working in that kind of environment and advocating on civil rights issues in the state.\" Johnson has continued to work at the state Department of Justice, Creighton said. ____ Follow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus",

Rubio had sought the GOP nomination for president, but dropped out of the race after Donald Trump soundly beat him in the Florida primary. Trump taunted Rubio during the primaries calling him \u201clittle Marco\u201d and painting him as a candidate not yet ready for prime time. Still, many speculate the 45-year-old senator will eventually make another presidential run. Rubio's entry into the Senate race immediately gave the party its best shot at holding the seat. Outside groups pumped millions of dollars into the race to help ensure the victory. Murphy at one point nearly closed the gap in the polls despite national Democrats diverting their money from Florida to Senate races, where television ads are less expensive. Republicans attacked Murphy for embellishing his resume by claiming to be a small business owner and a certified public accountant before being elected to Congress in 2012. Murphy was a part owner of an environmental cleanup company, but the business was set up by his wealthy father, and he was a licensed CPA in Colorado, but not in Florida, where he worked at an accounting firm. Murphy repeatedly criticized Rubio for saying he still supported Trump even after calling the billionaire a dangerous, erratic man who couldn't be trusted with the nuclear codes. Murphy also called out Rubio for missed votes and intelligence briefings while running for president, and questioned whether he would serve his full six-year term. Rubio wouldn't make that commitment until the candidates' first debate, when he said, \"God willing,\" he will serve the entire term. Rubio won his seat in 2010, using a Tea Party wave to come from behind and beat then-Gov. Charlie Crist. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Credit: Library of Congress) Eighty-four years ago this week, Amelia Earhart stunned the world by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, in a grueling test of endurance and skill. Today, 130 women pilots are gearing up for a challenge that will be just as demanding and personally fulfilling \u2014 they will be flying the Air Race Classic, an annual four-day, 2,700-mile, all-women airplane race. From the moment they leave Prescott, Ariz., the morning of June 21, they will put their determination and abilities to the test as they wing their way across the country as fast as their airplanes will go, racing the clock around the Midwest and down to Daytona Beach, Fla. Over the years, ARC racers have included WASP who flew for the Army during World War II, the country\u2019s first helicopter instrument flight instructor, military fliers, airline pilots, civilian flight instructors, college students, even high school students; women of all ages and from all walks of life. The ARC is a direct descendant of the 1929 Women\u2019s Air Derby \u2014 aka the Powder Puff \u2014 which Earhart flew but, incidentally, did not win. Back then, women held only about 3 percent of pilot\u2019s licenses. That wasn\u2019t unusual; many professions were virtually exclusively male. But in the 80 years since, much has changed. More than 50 percent of college students in the U.S. are female. Women practice in every medical specialty. The Supreme Court, which didn\u2019t get its first woman justice until 1981, is now one-third female. And in aviation? The percentage of U.S. aviators who are women has risen to a whopping 6 percent: about 40,000 women out of 600,000 total pilots. Why hasn\u2019t aviation kept up? Shamefully, as in 1929, it is still largely a boys\u2019 club. Many flight schools expect students to be familiar with engines and mechanical systems that girls are not exposed to. Females who ask questions are made to feel stupid. Sexual harassment can start during flight training and persist throughout a woman\u2019s piloting career. At a recent\u00a0National Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA) contest, a female competitor from a storied aviation university was singled out for shaming on social media by other teams. Think it got personal? Of course it did. Qantas, the Australian airline, only this year got around to providing woman-tailored uniforms for its female pilots. The author, Bev Weintraub, piloting her aircraft. (Credit: Philip F. Cianciolo) Last week, four female pilots sued Frontier Airlines claiming discrimination while they were pregnant and nursing \u2014\u00a0including forced unpaid leave of as much as 10 weeks. The indignities range from the ridiculous to the outrageous, and they make no sense. The aviation industry should be seeking out the best pilots around, both men and women, rather than dismissing half the population. Encouraging female pilots would be good for business: Harley-Davidson saw sales boom when it started marketing to women, a promising strategy for flight schools operating on a shoestring. It would be good for safety: A 2013 survey found that while women make up 10 percent of U.S. Army Apache helicopter pilots, they account for only 3 percent of accidents \u2014 for all-female crews, the number of accidents was zero. And it would be good for the country: The U.S. is suffering from a pilot shortage that has, according to Forbes magazine, already curtailed air service to more than 100 cities since 2013 and is only going to get worse. Doubling the hiring pool would provide many of the thousands of pilots we will need in the decades ahead. Until that happens, though, each of our nation\u2019s female fliers needs to answer the skepticism and nagging doubts by showing confidence in her abilities, having the skills to back it up and building a robust support system. That\u2019s why, even in 2016, the Air Race Classic is so important. The ARC is the oldest women\u2019s networking organization in aviation, providing aeronautical education, safety training, professional contacts and an unparalleled opportunity for putting piloting abilities to the test. The 55 teams who will be competing this year are a source of support and strength \u2013 and fierce competition, forcing all who fly the race to bring their best. When those pilots take off from Prescott, facing brutal heat, high density altitude, unfamiliar mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather, they will prove beyond a doubt that they have earned their wings, soaring high and flying proud. Beverly Weintraub, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, is a New York-based director of the Air Race Classic and will be competing in this year\u2019s race, co-piloting a Beechcraft Sundowner C23.",

            "article_content": "OMAHA, Neb. \u2013 Supporters of a teacher whose Omaha Catholic school contract will not be renewed because of his same-sex relationship say the school is discriminating against him based on his sexual orientation. But experts say the school has not violated Omaha's 3-year-old anti-bias ordinance protecting gay and transgender people because the ordinance has a religious exception, and a lawsuit would probably not succeed. Skutt Catholic High School rescinded its offer to renew the contract Matt Eledge, an English teacher and speech team coach, after learning he planned to marry his same-sex partner, saying that would violate church tenet in breach of his contract, according to Kacie Hughes, a close friend of Eledge's and assistant Skutt speech coach. The school later said he could return to the school, but only if he ended his same-sex relationship. Eledge, 28, confirmed that his contract at Skutt has not been renewed. He's taught at the school since 2010, and the speech team he coaches just won its fourth straight state championship. \"Whatever happens, I love Nebraska and I love my job. I love working here,\" he said. \"I want to do the right thing, but I don't want to say anything that would hurt my job or anybody I care about. I'm scared and unsure and fearful. I'm just trying to finish out the year at this point.\" Hughes, a 2012 graduate of Skutt, said Eledge was told by his bosses that if he told his students he was gay, \"he'd be fired on the spot,\" she said. \"Catholic schools in general allow teachers to be divorced without an annulment, or let teachers be on the pill or let men get a vasectomy ... there are so many examples,\" Hughes said. \"You don't do this to anyone else except for him, because he's gay.\" Omaha Archdiocese Chancellor Tim McNeil said that's not true. There have been single, pregnant teachers and those who've divorced and remarried outside the Catholic church who have lost their jobs, he said. He also acknowledged that plenty of teachers get away with breaking church tenet, saying the archdiocese essentially has a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. \"Of course there's a lot we don't know,\" McNeil said. \"We don't go looking for these situations.\" McNeil and the school's president, John McMahon, both declined to comment on Eledge's employment, citing a personnel confidentiality policy. In 2012, Omaha passed an ordinance that that extended workplace anti-bias protections to gay and transgender workers. But the ordinance exempts religious organizations and schools, said Renee Biglow, human relations representative for Omaha's Human Rights and Relations Division. Steven Willborn, a professor of employment discrimination law at the University of Nebraska College of Law, said Eledge is not protected by any local, state or federal law. \"If they had a rule against drinking, and they only enforced the rule against drinking for black teachers and not white teachers, they'd have a claim, because that's racial discrimination and illegal,\" Willborn said. \"But here, their claim would be that they're treating him differently because of his sexual orientation, and there's just no law against that.\" A bill in the Nebraska Legislature would extend discrimination protections to gay and transgendered workers, but it has a religious exception. Any reversal would be more likely to come from a public opinion backlash, Willborn said, such as seen recently in Indiana when that state's lawmakers passed a religious objections law that critics said would sanction discrimination against gays and lesbians. \"Of course, the public opinion that would matter most at Skutt would be what their parents and supporters and donors think,\" Willborn said. Asked if he's considering legal action, Eledge said he's only focused on teaching his students for the next six weeks. He has received a number of offers to teach at other schools next year, he said. \"So, maybe it's a blessing in disguise,\" he said. \"I just want to teach.\"",

            "article_content": "Investigation found Ferguson police disproportionately used excessive force against black people and stopped and searched them far more often than white people The Ferguson Police Department routinely violated the constitutional rights of the local African-American population in the Missouri city for years, the Department of Justice has found in a searing report. The investigation, launched after the August shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, found that the department violated the Fourth Amendment in instances such as making traffic stops without reasonable suspicion and making arrests without probable cause. The report provides direct evidence of racial bias among police officers and court workers, and details a criminal justice system that through the issuance of petty citations for infractions such as walking in the middle of the street, prioritizes generating revenue from fines over public safety. The practice hits poor people especially hard, sometimes leading to jail time when they can't pay, the report says, and has contributed to a cynicism about the police on the part of citizens. The official release of the report could come as early as Wednesday. The details were provided to Fox News on Tuesday by law enforcement officials familiar with the department's findings. The Justice Department alleges that the discrimination was triggered at least partly by racial bias and stereotypes about African-Americans, a violation of the 14th Amendment. The report details a November 2008 email on an official Ferguson municipal account which joked that President Obama would not be president for long because \u201cwhat black man holds a steady job for four years?\u201d From 2012 to 2014, the report found, African-Americans comprised 85 percent of people pulled over for a traffic stop; 90 percent of those given citations; and 93 percent of arrests. Also, African-American drivers were more than twice as likely to be searched during a traffic stop than white drivers, but that those black drivers were 26 percent less likely to be found to be holding contraband. The report also accuses the Ferguson police of using unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that 88 percent of those cases involved African-Americans. Overall, blacks make up 67 percent of Ferguson's population. The Justice Department began the civil rights investigation following the August killing of Brown, which set off weeks of protests. A separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear the officer, Darren Wilson, of federal civil rights charges. The department has conducted roughly 20 broad civil rights investigations of police departments during the six-year tenure of Attorney General Eric Holder, including Cleveland, Newark, New Jersey and Albuquerque. Most such investigations end with police departments agreeing to change their practices. Justice Department officials were in St. Louis on Tuesday to brief Ferguson leaders about the findings, a city official said. Several messages seeking comment from Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson and Mayor James Knowles III were not returned. A secretary for Jackson said he is not doing media interviews. Scott Holste, a spokesman for Gov. Jay Nixon, declined comment, saying he has not seen the report. Ben Crump, the attorney for the Brown family, said that if the reports about the findings are true, they \"confirm what Michael Brown's family has believed all along, and that is that the tragic killing of an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager was part of a systemic pattern of inappropriate policing of African-American citizens in the Ferguson community.\" Fox News' Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on the 2016 presidential campaign (all times EDT): 9:20 p.m. Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and other conservative billionaires are pouring money into a super PAC dedicated to defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency. New campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show that Adelson and his wife together donated $10 million last month to Future 45, a group that can accept unlimited amounts of money from donors. That was a huge portion of the total $12.3 million the group raised over the past three months. Kentucky's Joe Craft, who made his fortune in the coal industry, gave $750,000. Future 45 was founded by former TD Ameritrade chairman Joe Ricketts, who gave it $1 million. The super PAC and a related ___ 8:50 p.m. Donald Trump says that, if he's elected to the White House, there won't be any relationship more important to the U.S. than its relationship with India. Trump says at a Republican Hindu Coalition fundraiser in New Jersey Saturday night that \"under a Trump admiration we are going to become even better friends.\" He adds: \"In fact, I'll take the word 'even' out because we are going to be best friends. There won't be any relationship more important to us.\" Trump also praises Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a \"great man\" and says he looks forward to deepening diplomatic and military ties with India. The event features colorful performances by popular Bollywood singers and dancers. ___ 7:35 p.m. A Wisconsin sheriff who supports Donald Trump says it's time to respond to government and media corruption not with words but with \"pitchforks and torches.\" Sheriff David Clarke Jr. of Wisconsin's Milwaukee County makes the assertion in a Saturday posting on Twitter. He illustrates his point with a photo showing angry people with clubs and torches. In the tweet, Clarke writes: \"It's incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ, and big media are corrupt & all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.\" Clarke is an elected Democrat but spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer. He has denounced the Black Lives Matter movement though he, too, is black. ___ 7:30 p.m. Donald Trump is appearing alongside Bollywood performers at a charity event sponsored by the Republican Hindu Coalition. Trump is set to speak at the \"Humanity United Against Terror\" event in Edison, New Jersey, on Saturday night. Attendees have been watching colorful Bollywood song and dance performances, interspersed with political commentary. The Republican Hindu Coalition was modeled on the powerful Republican Jewish Coalition. ___ 6:45 p.m. Donald Trump is rolling out a new, multipoint plan to combat drug addiction as he talks about the role that prescription drugs play in the heroin epidemic. Speaking at a rally Saturday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Trump says he wants the Food and Drug Administration to speed up the approval of abuse-deterring drugs. He says he also wants to reduce the supply of drugs like oxycodone, and wants to make it harder to mail drugs like fentanyl to users and dealers. Trump is also calling for more drug courts and for mandatory addiction treatment. The Republican presidential nominee has long claimed he'd stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. by building a wall along the U.S-Mexico border and by deporting traffickers living in the U.S. illegally. His speech Saturday marks the first time he has spoken at length about prescription drugs and their role in the heroin epidemic. ___ 5:30 p.m. The list of women alleging aggressive sexual behavior by Donald Trump is growing again. This time it's a woman who claims he tried to kiss her on the mouth when he was introduced to her at a Mother's Day brunch at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Cathy Heller tells The Guardian newspaper that Trump was greeting guests at the event about 20 years ago and she stood and extended her hand. She said Trump took her hand, then grabbed her and \"went for the lips.\" She says she leaned backward and almost lost her balance, turning her head at the last minute, and he kissed her on the side of her mouth. Heller says she was in the company of her husband, children and in-laws and that the episode left her \"angry and shaken.\" The Guardian reports that two people provided accounts of the incident that matched hers. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller dismisses Heller's account as \"a false accusation\" and says it could hardly have taken place as described on Mother's Day and in public. ___ 5 p.m. A January 2016 email from Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, to her campaign chairman, John Podesta, followed up on a phone call to provide a history of allegations made by the woman who accuses Bill Clinton of raping her in the late 1970s. The email appears in a release of hacked material from WikiLeaks. Juanita Broaddrick was among the three past accusers of the former president who attended last week's presidential debate in St. Louis at the invitation of Donald Trump. Bill Clinton has denied the rape accusation made by Broaddrick, and it was never adjudicated by a criminal court. The documents in the WikiLeaks release include the affidavit that Broaddrick signed saying that Clinton did not assault her and the independent counsel's history of the Paula Jones case in which Broaddrick later received immunity from any prosecution for perjury if she changed her story. Kendall wrote in the email to Podesta, \"Voila! She did, disavowing her sworn affidavit and sworn deposition testimony.\" He concluded, \"Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide about this slimefest.\" ___ 4:55 p.m. A series of exchanges among Clinton aides and her attorney in August 2015 show internal wrangling over what to say to the public about the ongoing scandal over her use of personal email and a private server. The exchanges appear in hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. In one conversation, speechwriter Dan Schwerin sent campaign chairman John Podesta and top aides a suggested statement from Clinton saying that she had asked her team to \"hand over my email server, as well as a thumb drive\" with her emails. At the time, The Washington Post had reported that the FBI was looking into the security of the server and drive. Clinton lawyer David Kendall pushed back on the statement's wording because it didn't specify that the server was being given to the Justice Department as opposed to the State Department, which was reviewing Clinton's emails for public release. Kendall predicted how Clinton critics might respond once the full facts came out: \"There they go again \u2014 misleading, devious, non-transparent, tricky.\" ___ 4:50 p.m. Aides to Hillary Clinton wrestled with whether an open letter from her should specifically reference former Secretary of State Colin Powell in arguing that she used the same email practices as her predecessors. In hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, the Clinton aides agreed to say that her actions had been \"consistent with practice of prior secretaries\" but to remove a reference in a fact sheet to Powell. Powell's private advice to Clinton about setting up private email later became public. In Powell's own emails that were hacked this year, he complained that Clinton's team was trying to blame him for her mistakes. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri in August 2015 also told her colleagues she hoped that \"we could use the 'server moment' as an opportunity\" for Clinton to be seen as taking a big step to deal with the controversy. But Palmieri said it was clear Clinton \"is not in the same place,\" unless campaign chairman John Podesta was able to get her to change her mind. ___ 4:45 p.m. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence says the people of Indiana \"don't like to hurry into new ideas.\" The Indiana governor pointed to the state's slow acceptance of daylight saving time, which was adopted about a decade ago and only after intense debate. Pence made the remarks in Indianapolis on Saturday during a ceremony celebrating the state's 200th birthday. He also dedicated a new plaza outside the Capitol building, which was supposed to be built a century ago for the state's 100th birthday. Pence says he's glad it finally got done. ___ 4 p.m. As Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign geared up in 2015, her aides hoped to procure some star power to give her a boost \u2014 someone sensational, but not too sensational. New hacked emails released via WikiLeaks show that Clinton's scheduling director asked aides for a list of celebrities willing to help the campaign and suggested options \"somewhere between a high school band and Lady Gaga.\" Aides quickly gave the go-ahead to using actress Julianne Moore. One aide said \"Girls\" creator Lena Dunham would help but cautioned that the actress was \"a bit more edgy.\" Also floated were Meryl Streep, Morgan Freeman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jesse Taylor Ferguson, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. In another email, an aide listed musical performers who would likely help if in New York, among them Nick Jonas, Jon Bon Jovi, Christina Aguilera, John Legend and Alicia Keys. ___ 3:20 p.m. Donald Trump says he raised $100 million last month for his presidential campaign and Republican partners. That would make September the best fundraising month Trump has had. But it was no match for Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee raised $154 million last month. Trump and his allies began October with $75 million in cash reserves \u2014 exactly half of what Clinton's team said it had. Trump's statement on Saturday comes five days ahead of when he and Clinton will file September fundraising details with federal regulators. Clinton disclosed her monthly totals two weeks ago. Trump's September fundraising includes a $2 million personal donation. ___ 3:10 p.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan's office says the Wisconsin Republican is \"fully confident\" that the November election will be carried out \"with integrity.\" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong says the U.S. democracy \"relies on confidence in election results.\" She says Ryan has confidence in the states, which oversee voting. Ryan's office was responding to a question about whether the speaker agreed with Donald Trump's assertion that the election may be \"rigged.\" Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claim. Ryan has said he will no longer defend Trump or campaign for him. But he has not revoked his endorsement of the Republican presidential nominee. ___ 1:55 p.m. Hillary Clinton's campaign is hitting back against Donald Trump's assertion the White House race is shaping up as \"a rigged election.\" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook says participation in the electoral system \u2014 and particularly voting \u2014 is something to be encouraged, and not, in his words, \"dismissed or undermined because a candidate is afraid he's going to lose.\" Mook points to what he says will be a record turnout on Election Day. And he says voters will turn out in unprecedented numbers because they can see through Trump's \"shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens.\" Trump posted tweets on Saturday morning alleging \"false and unsubstantiated charges\" and \"outright lies\" are being pushed by the media as part of a scheme to help elect Clinton president. ___ 1:10 p.m. Donald Trump is accusing rival Hillary Clinton of being on some kind of drug during the last debate, and says that both candidates should be tested for substances ahead of the next one. The Republican presidential nominee offered no evidence to support the bizarre claim, which he appeared to base on his belief that Clinton was energetic at the start of their second debate and downbeat at its conclusion. He says, \"I think she's actually getting pumped up\" while she's off the trail. He also mocked Clinton for what he suggested was wasting time by preparing for their debates. Trump called on both candidates to take a drug test prior to the final debate on Wednesday. The GOP nominee made the extraordinary, baseless assertion when speaking at an outdoor rally on Saturday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. ___ 12:55 p.m. Donald Trump's campaign is denouncing and severing ties with the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, Matt Borges. It's the latest crack in GOP unity in the critical battleground state, where Republican Gov. John Kasich is also not behind the party's presidential nominee. Borges has been openly critical of Trump on several occasions and told some Ohio news outlets he wasn't sure if he would vote for Trump. Trump's Ohio chairman Bob Paduchik is accusing Borges of undermining Trump as part of a bid to be the next Republican National Committee chair. Borges has been mentioned as a possible successor to Reince Priebus. Paduchik says in a letter to state committee members that Trump is \"very disappointed in Matt's duplicity.\" Paduchik says he still expects the Ohio Republican Party to pay the campaign's payroll and expenses in the state. Borges did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ___ 9 a.m. Donald Trump has taken to Twitter on Saturday morning to go after Hillary Clinton and the media, and to claim again that the presidential race is looking like \u2014 in his words \u2014 \"a rigged election.\" That's an unprecedented assertion in a country with a history of peaceful democratic transition. Trump is denying stories in which some women have accused him of sexual misconduct. He says the allegations are \"100 percent fabricated and made-up charges\" and are being pushed by the Clinton campaign and the media. Trump says they \"may poison the minds of the American Voter\" and he claims: \"FIX!\" Trump tweets that such \"false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies\" are being pushed before the Nov. 8 election in order to put Clinton in the White House.",

But he strikes a nerve\u2014with me, at least\u2014in turning his attention to the working-class Americans who helped power Trump\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination. This, in my view, is a principal reason that most of the mainstream media utterly misjudged Trump\u2019s appeal. \u201cFor the white working class, having had their morals roundly mocked, their religion deemed primitive, and their economic prospects decimated, now find their very gender and race, indeed the very way they talk about reality, described as a kind of problem for the nation to overcome. This is just one aspect of what Trump has masterfully signaled as 'political correctness' run amok\u201d\u2014that is, a progressive passion for \u201cracial and sexuality of outcome,\u201d rather than mere equality of opportunity. Trump\u2019s appeal to these voters is often described in economic terms (he\u2019ll bring back jobs and fight for better trade deals). But it is also cultural: \u201cMuch of the newly energized left has come to see the white working class not as allies but primarily as bigots, misogynists, racists, and homophobes, thereby condemning those often at the near-bottom rung of the economy to the bottom rung of the culture as well. A struggling white man in the heartland is now told to \u2018check his privilege\u2019 by students at Ivy League colleges\u2026 \u201cThese working-class communities, already alienated, hear \u2014 how can they not? \u2014 the glib and easy dismissals of \u2018white straight men\u2019 as the ultimate source of all our woes. They smell the condescension and the broad generalizations about them \u2014 all of which would be repellent if directed at racial minorities.\u201d And that is what many journalists missed\u2014because they\u2019re so disconnected from that world. Their jobs aren\u2019t threatened by trade deals. They often live upper-middle-class lifestyles in places like New York, Washington and Los Angeles, often don\u2019t take public transportation, often don\u2019t send their kids to public schools. David Brooks, a conservative who opposes Trump, copped to this in a recent New York Times column: \u201cI was surprised by Trump\u2019s success because I\u2019ve slipped into a bad pattern, spending large chunks of my life in the bourgeois strata \u2014 in professional circles with people with similar status and demographics to my own. It takes an act of will to rip yourself out of that and go where you feel least comfortable. But this column is going to try to do that over the next months and years.\u201d Trump got at the feelings of a world turned upside-down, at least among the male species, during a speech in Spokane: \u201cI mean all of the men, we\u2019re petrified to speak to women anymore. We may raise our voice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what, the women get it better than we do, folks.\" Sullivan traces the politics of resentment from the Tea Party through Black Lives Matter, and says Obama unintentionally became a symbol of some whites feeling culturally marginalized. Another passage that jumped out at me has to do with gay rights. Sullivan famously made the conservative case for gay marriage way in an essay way back in 1989. Now that it\u2019s the law of the land, Sullivan takes a shot at \u201cthe gay left, for whom the word magnanimity seems unknown, even in the wake of stunning successes.\u201d When it comes to the politics of resentment, says Andrew, \u201cTrump saw what others didn\u2019t.\u201d But the media have an opportunity to learn from their mistakes, and this goes well beyond Trump. We all need to better understand the frustration of folks who are fed up with with politics as usual and media as usual.",

            "article_content": "Shelves full of cigarettes are pictured at a CVS store in the Manhattan borough of New York February 5, 2014 (REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo) Cigarettes are often cheaper at the very place that people shop for health supplies and fill medicine prescriptions, according to a new study in California. \"Compared to other types of stores, pharmacies charged customers less for cigarettes, more for bottled water,\" said lead author Lisa Henriksen of the Stanford Prevention Research Center at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto. \"It's surprising that stores that are supposed to promote health sell the world's deadliest product of all, and even worse that they sell it at the cheapest price,\" Henriksen said. Pharmacies represent 7 percent of the 380,000 tobacco retailers nationwide, Henriksen and her colleagues write in the American Journal of Public Health. Convenience stores sell many more cigarettes, but pharmacies offer them at cheaper prices, she told Reuters Health. \"Price is the single best predictor of use, with lower cigarette prices driving higher smoking rates, lower quitting rates, and higher rates of smoking initiation among teens,\" she said. \"The most vulnerable population groups are also the most price sensitive, which is why the findings about neighborhood disparities in prices are also important.\" Researchers found that among pharmacies, Newport menthol cigarettes, popular among African Americans, were among the cheapest brands, and they cost even less at stores in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of black residents. The researchers randomly selected more than 500 licensed tobacco retailers in California in 2014 and recorded the prices of their Marlboro cigarettes, Newport cigarettes and the cheapest cigarettes available as well as the price of bottled water. They gathered similar data from more than 2,000 retailers across the U.S. near schools with eighth, tenth and twelfth graders in 2012. In both studies, the least expensive cigarettes per store were cheaper in pharmacies - by $0.47 to $1.19, on average, in California. Bottled water, which may reflect the pricing of a range of other goods, cost more in pharmacies than in other stores, like convenience stores. While bottled water prices did not vary by neighborhood demographics, the cost of Newport and other cigarettes varied by race or neighborhood income and age profiles. Amanda Amos, professor of health promotion at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, told Reuters Health by email that she was \"shocked and bemused\" to learn pharmacies in the U.S. would sell cigarettes, which are the most lethal legal product on the market and kill half of all regular users. \"Pharmacies (in the U.K.) would never sell cigarettes as this does not fit in with their health promoting role,\" said Amos, who was not part of the new study. \"Rather, most pharmacies would see their role as helping smokers to quit through providing nicotine replacement products and support.\" Amos worked on two reviews for the European Commission that found increasing the real price of cigarettes was the most effective way to reduce smoking uptake in young people and increase adult quitting, she said. Laws prohibiting tobacco sales in pharmacies are rare in the U.S., despite wide public support in polls. San Francisco passed the first law and 70 percent of Massachusetts residents live in jurisdictions with tobacco-free pharmacies, http://bit.ly/2bRQhqM told Reuters Health. \"Apart from whether it decreases smoking, it has the added advantage of denormalizing tobacco and reducing its availability,\" she said. \"There are many more tobacco retailers than needed to meet demand for the product.\" For jurisdictions looking to reduce the number of tobacco retailers, pharmacies are an obvious choice, she said. \"Tobacco-free pharmacies are low hanging fruit for state and local tobacco control.\"",

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 Donald Trump has stepped back only slightly from his refusal to say during his debate with Hillary Clinton whether he would concede if he loses on Election Day, failing to stem the criticism that flowed from Republicans and Democrats over an attitude some contended struck at the heart of American democracy. \"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\" Trump said Thursday while campaigning in Ohio. After letting that vow hang in the air for a few seconds, he added, \"if I win.\" Putting aside his mocking tone, Trump said he would accept \"a clear election result\" but reserved his right to \"contest or file a legal challenge\" if he lost on Nov. 8. He brushed off the likelihood of that happening with a confident prediction that \"we're not going to lose.\" Among those criticizing Trump was Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race. \"I didn't like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,\" McCain said in a statement. \"A concession isn't just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader's first responsibility.\" While Trump maintained he would win, numerous Republican leaders conceded that he was heading for defeat barring a significant shift in the campaign's closing days. The GOP's top concern was turning to salvaging its majority in the Senate, followed closely by worries over the Republicans' once comfortable grip on the House. The annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a Catholic fundraiser in New York, was by tradition a moment when the Republican and Democratic nominees could turn any campaign vitriol into barbed humor and ultimately a show of national unity. The Thursday night event offered many hearty laughs \u2014 and a few awkward ones. \"We have proven we can actually be civil with each other,\" Trump said about the opponent he has asserted belongs in jail for alleged criminal acts. \"In fact, just before taking the dais Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, 'Pardon me.'\" Following Trump at the dinner, Clinton cracked: \"I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.\" But Trump drew some boos and jeers in the Waldorf-Astoria ballroom when he referred to Clinton being \"so corrupt\" and said without apparent humor that she was appearing at the event \"pretending not to hate Catholics\" \u2014 a line delivered during a benefit for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Clinton's jokes were cutting but delivered in the more accepted fashion of a roast. While several women have accused Trump of being sexually aggressive, Clinton steered clear of that controversy but referenced his public comments about the appearance of women with whom he has feuded: \"Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4 \u2014 maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.\" During an Ohio rally earlier Thursday, Trump tried to turn the attention to Clinton by accusing her of \"cheating\" and suggesting she should \"resign from the race.\" He cited a hacked email disclosed publicly by WikiLeaks that showed her campaign was tipped off about a question she'd be asked in a CNN town hall meeting during the Democratic primary. \"Can you imagine if I got the questions? They would call for the re-establishment of the electric chair, do you agree?\" Trump said.",

            "article_content": "A closer look at the dials CHICAGO \u2013 Courts dealt setbacks to Republican efforts in three states to restrict\u00a0voting, blocking a North Carolina law requiring photo identification, loosening a similar measure in Wisconsin and halting strict citizenship requirements in Kansas. The rulings Friday came as the 2016 election moves into its final phase, with Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton locked in a high-stakes presidential race and control of the U.S. Senate possibly hanging in the balance. North Carolina is one of about a dozen swing states in the presidential race, while Wisconsin has\u00a0voted\u00a0Democratic in recent presidential elections and Kansas has been solidly Republican. The decisions followed a similar blow earlier this month to what critics said was one of the nation's most restrictive\u00a0voting\u00a0laws in Texas. The New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said Texas' voter ID law is discriminatory and must be weakened before the November election. On Friday, a three-judge panel of the Virginia-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked North Carolina's law that limited to six the number of acceptable photo IDs. The law also curtailed early\u00a0voting\u00a0and eliminated same-day registration. The court said the North Carolina provisions targeted African Americans with \"almost surgical precision.\" Critics of photo ID requirements say they fall disproportionately on minority voters and the poor, who are less likely to have an ID such as a driver's license and tend to\u00a0vote\u00a0Democratic. Supporters say they photo IDs are needed to combat voter fraud. Election-law expert Richard Hasen of the University of California at Irvine said the Obama administration took on the North Carolina and Texas cases as a bulwark against\u00a0voting\u00a0restrictions. \"If North Carolina and Texas could get away with these\u00a0voting\u00a0restrictions, it would have been a green light for other states to do so,\" he said. \"I think this is a hugely important decision.\" In the Kansas ruling, a county judge said the state must count thousands of\u00a0votes\u00a0in local and state elections from people who did not provide proof of U.S. citizenship when they registered. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national leader in Republican voter restriction efforts, had pushed through a rule that would have set those\u00a0votes\u00a0aside, perhaps up to 50,000 by the November election. The Kansas ruling just four days before the state primary election means that about 17,000 voters will have their ballots counted in races for the state Legislature and other local contests. Kobach said the decision would allow people living in the U.S. illegally to\u00a0vote, although\u00a0voting\u00a0rights advocates say there have been few cases of voter fraud in the past. In Wisconsin, a federal judge threw out a host of election laws, while allowing the state's voter ID law to remain in place with substantial limitations. U.S. District Judge James Peterson ordered the state to quickly issue credentials valid for\u00a0voting\u00a0to anyone trying to obtain a free photo ID but lacking underlying documents such as birth certificates. He struck down restrictions on absentee and early\u00a0voting, saying they discriminated against blacks. He also struck down an increase in residency requirements from 10 to 28 days, a prohibition on using expired but otherwise qualifying student IDs to\u00a0vote\u00a0and a prohibition on distributing absentee ballots by fax or email. Marc Elias, an attorney whose law firm has challenged\u00a0voting\u00a0restrictions in several states including Wisconsin and North Carolina, said the recent rulings are steps toward correcting \"voting\u00a0restriction laws put in place by Republican legislators.\" There's been a concerted effort by Republicans nationwide since President Barack Obama was elected to peel back\u00a0voting\u00a0rights and laws improving access to the polls that had been in place since the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, he said.",

            "article_content": "Protest organizer defends chant of 'pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon' Police departments face a recruiting shortage amid a growing anti-cop mood that some fear has taken the pride out of peacekeeping and put targets on the backs of the men and women in blue. Open calls for the killing of police have been followed by assassinations, including last week's murder in Texas of a Harris County sheriff's deputy. Instead of dialing back the incendiary rhetoric, groups including \"Black Lives Matter\" have instead doubled down at demonstrations with chants of \"Pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon.\" Public safety officials fear the net effect has been to demonize police, and diminish the job. \"It's a lot harder to sell now,\" Jeff Roorda, business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association and former state representative, told FoxNews.com. \"This is a very real phenomenon.\" \"We're sitting ducks. We're in these uniforms, brightly colored cars and there's nothing we can do.\" Roorda's colleagues witnessed the fierce, anti-police rioting that followed the police shooting last year of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. Even though a grand jury and a federal Justice Department inquiry did not fault Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, debunked claims that the cop killed Brown as he held his hands up and begged for his life have animated the Black Lives Matter movement as it spread around the nation. Roorda, who spoke in defense of police in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting, said protesters took to Twitter to promote a #KillRoorda hashtag. \"You no longer just have to worry about your life while in uniform,\" he said. \"Now you have to be worried about the well-being of your family,\" he said. Roorda said the new academy class continues to be delayed and the police force loses about double the amount of officers per year than in the past. Knowing police face public scorn or career-ending legal battles even if they acted properly has convinced many prospective cops to abandon their dreams of patrolling America's streets. \"I saw all this anti-cop propaganda and I was like, 'Who needs this?'\u201d said Antonio, a New Yorker who asked that only his first name be used. The 32-year-old had applied and been accepted into the NYPD academy, but withdrew his candidacy amid the cop-bashing climate sweeping the country. Even top police brass understand why the shield has lost its shine. FILE 2015: Protestors carry signs during a demonstration by \"Black Lives Matter\" in Los Angeles. (Reuters) \"Right now, policing is not the most attractive occupation that they could probably get into,\" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told CBS. Recruitment nationally is \"way down,\" said Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriff\u2019s Association. He said some sheriffs around the country say the number of applications has fallen by as much as 50 percent. While blatant calls for killing cops are unusual, the job has always been dangerous. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which monitors the number of police officers killed in the line of duty, tabulated 48 police officers around the nation were killed by gunfire in 2014. So far this year, 26 law enforcement officers have been shot to death on duty, putting the nation on track for a 19 percent decrease. But these numbers do not identify police officers intentionally targeted for the mere fact that they wear a badge. Police in Texas believe that may have been the sole motivation for the murder Friday night of Harris County Sheriff's Officer Darren Goforth at a gas station in a Houston suburb. The suspect in that case, Shannon Jaruay Miles, allegedly came up behind Goforth as he pumped gas and shot the officer 15 times. In December 2014, New York City Police Officers Wenjian Liu and his partner Rafael Ramos were killed in an ambush while sitting inside their patrol car on a Brooklyn streetcorner. \"No warning, no provocation,\" Police Commissioner William Bratton said at the time. \"They were quite simply assassinated, targeted for their uniform.\" The gunman reportedly announced online that he was planning to shoot two \"pigs\" to avenge the death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island, N.Y., man who died after being put in a chokehold by police who were arresting him for selling loose cigarettes. \"I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs,\" Ismaaiyl Brinsley wrote on an Instagram account. Brinsley killed himself on a subway platform as police closed in on him. There is currently a massive manhunt in Fox Lake, Ill., after a police officer was shot and killed while pursuing a group of men. Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, known affectionately as \"GI Joe\" was giving chase to three men on foot. In addition to the Brown and Garner cases, the anti-police sentiment has been fueled by the April death in police custody of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and the fatal shooting, also in April, of Walter Scott in South Carolina. Six Baltimore police officers face charges in the death of Gray, who died of injuries suffered while being transported in a police van. North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager has been charged with murder in Scott's shooting. Galvanized by the deaths, Black Lives Matter has sought to bring attention to the issue of police brutality with protests around the nation. \"What's more uncomfortable, shouting, stopping freeways and interrupting speeches -- or being murdered by police and having your body left in the street for more than four hours, or turning up dead in a jail cell after a traffic stop?\" the group posted on Facebook. Some law enforcement officials believe President Obama has fanned the flames by not denouncing the movement more unequivocally, although he did personally call the widow of Goforth and has condemned violence against police. \"President Obama has breathed life into this ugly movement,\" Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke told \"Fox & Friends.\" \"And it is time now for good, law-abiding Americans to rise up. We now have to counter this slime, this filth coming out of these cop haters.\" Sgt. Delroy Burton, chairman of the DC Police Union in Washington, compared the current treatment of police to veterans returning from the Vietnam War. \"We have to fight the bad guys, and the policymakers go unnoticed,\" he said. Burton, who was born in Jamaica and is a former U.S. Marine, said his police force is about 131 officers understaffed and has seen nearly 600 officers resign in the past 19 months -- a number he said is unheard of. \"We're sitting ducks,\" he said. \"We're in these uniforms, brightly colored cars and there's nothing we can do. And the vast majority supports this loud vocal minority.\" Follow Edmund DeMarche on Twitter: @EDeMarche",

Eighty-five percent say there\u2019s more than usual at stake in this year\u2019s presidential race, according to a Fox News poll released Thursday.\u00a0 That\u2019s up from 70 percent who felt that way in 2012.\u00a0 Clinton (83 percent) and Trump supporters (87 percent) are about equally likely to feel like there\u2019s more at stake. The new poll shows Hillary Clinton with a three-point edge over Donald Trump (42-39 percent) in a hypothetical matchup.\u00a0 That\u2019s within the poll\u2019s margin of error. CLICK TO READ THE POLL RESULTS The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday -- right as Clinton finally captured enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination.\u00a0 Trump hit that mark May 26. Clinton\u2019s edge over Trump is due to a six-point drop in support for him rather than an increase for her.\u00a0 Trump was up by 45-42 percent three weeks ago (May 14-17, 2016).\u00a0 Since then, he lost three points among self-identified Republicans and 11 points among independents. Clinton is ahead among blacks (+76), unmarried women (+34), women (+18), lower-income households (+14), and voters under age 30 (+13). Trump is preferred among white evangelicals (+42), whites without a college degree (+25), whites (+16), men (+15), and independents (+5). Expect the race to remain tight, as people are pretty set with their choice. Voters were asked if there is a chance their candidate \u201ccould say or do something\u201d that would make them change their mind before Election Day.\u00a0 More than 8-in-10 Clinton backers say there is no chance at all (57 percent) or only a small chance (24 percent).\u00a0 Sentiment is almost identical for Trump supporters: 57 percent say no chance and 23 percent say just a small chance. Voters may be committed to their candidate, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re happy about it.\u00a0 Trump supporters are split between being happy to vote for him (51 percent) and holding their nose (48 percent).\u00a0 Clinton backers are more upbeat:\u00a0 60 percent happy vs. 37 percent holding their nose. For comparison, in March 2000, only one quarter of George W. Bush supporters (24 percent) and those backing Al Gore (25 percent) said they would have to hold their nose. Both candidates have reason for optimism.\u00a0 Among just those \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d interested in the election, Trump is up by 45-41 percent.\u00a0 That\u2019s because more Republicans (78 percent) than Democrats (67 percent) are interested. On the other hand, far more see Clinton (69 percent) as qualified to be president than feel the same about Trump (47 percent).\u00a0 And more than twice as many think she is \u201cvery\u201d qualified:\u00a0 37 percent Clinton vs. 17 percent Trump. \u201cClinton\u2019s attacks on Trump during her recent foreign policy speech seem to draw directly on sentiments expressed by voters in this poll,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. \u201cVoters have serious doubts that Trump is qualified and are concerned about his temperament.\u201d By wide margins Clinton is rated higher on having the knowledge (+33 points) and temperament (+27 points) to serve effectively as president.\u00a0 More voters also see her as likeable (+8 points). Roughly 6-in-10 say Trump is not likeable (58 percent), and he does not have the knowledge (59 percent) or temperament (62 percent) for the job. By a 39-point margin, voters think Trump is the one who \u201cwill shake things up in Washington.\u201d Majorities feel Clinton (54 percent) and Trump (58 percent) lack the integrity to be president. Some 36 percent of Republicans and 22 percent of Trump supporters think he does not have the temperament to be president. \u201cWhile many voters find their choices odorous, they see stark choices -- a knowledgeable, qualified candidate or one with the wrong temperament who will shake things up,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cIt says a lot about the country that the race is so close right now, but it is hard to imagine it stays like that into the fall unless Trump can convince voters he will keep his cool as president.\u201d Five months from today the election will be over.\u00a0 Who do voters think will win?\u00a0 Right now 46 percent say Clinton and 40 percent say Trump. Clinton and Trump are generally liked within their respective parties.\u00a0 She garners a 76 percent favorable among Democrats and he gets 73 percent among Republicans. Overall, however, voters view Trump and Clinton negatively.\u00a0 Fifty-eight percent have an unfavorable view of the GOP nominee, including 49 percent who view him \u201cstrongly\u201d unfavorably.\u00a0 Clinton\u2019s unfavorable is 56 percent.\u00a0 That includes 43 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d unfavorable. Those negatives could go higher given the name calling that\u2019s already started. Views are mixed over Clinton calling Trump \u201ca fraud,\u201d as 43 percent think that\u2019s an accurate characterization, while 50 percent disagree.\u00a0 By a 49-47 percent margin, voters agree with Trump\u2019s \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d nickname. Do people want to hear more?\u00a0 Forty-seven percent say they\u2019re more likely to change the channel when Trump comes on television, while 46 percent say turn up the volume.\u00a0 For Clinton, 52 percent change the channel, while 41 percent turn it up. Pollpourri By a 61-36 percent margin, voters distrust the government.\u00a0 Voters who trust the government back Clinton (+40 points); those who don\u2019t, back Trump (+21). The poll shows there\u2019s potential support for an independent candidate.\u00a0 In the Clinton-Trump matchup, seven percent of voters volunteer the response \u201csomeone else.\u201d\u00a0 In addition, in a three-way contest that includes Libertarian Gary Johnson, he receives 12 percent, yet Clinton still tops Trump by 39-36 percent. Bernie Sanders continues to gain popularity:\u00a0 54 percent of voters view him favorably, up from 44 percent in March and 34 percent in September. The poll finds Sanders ahead of Trump by 11 points in a potential matchup (49-38 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,004 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from June 5-8, 2016.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Claudia Cowan reports on program in Richmond, California A San Francisco suburb is testing a controversial strategy to combat the gun violence that's plagued the community \u2013 paying people not to commit crimes. The experiment known as \u201cAdvance Peace\u201d is being conducted in Richmond, Calif., and works like this: The 18-month fellowship hires convicted felons to \"court\" troubled youth -- who so far have avoided arrest due to lack of evidence -- with offers of cash and out-of-town vacations if they mend their ways. If, after six months, a \u201cfellow\u201d in the voluntary program begins to achieve specific goals, they can earn up to $1,000 a month. That doesn't sit well with victims\u2019 rights activist Lorrain Taylor, whose twin sons were gunned down in the nearby city of Oakland when they were just 22. \"If I were to find out that the guy who murdered my twin sons was getting a thousand dollars for a promise? I mean, how can you trust? ... I mean, if they kill somebody, they will lie,\" Taylor said, breaking down in tears. But supporters say the money, which comes from private donations, is like an allowance that many American parents give their children as a reward for hard work -- and argue daily, intensive engagement is the only way to disrupt urban gun violence. Fox News went for a drive with one ex-con, Joe McCoy, who now works for the city and has paired up with young \u201cfellows\u201d like 26-year-old Harold Sylvan to help them set positive goals. \"Like, I've never had a job,\" Sylvan, who has served time for drug crimes, told Fox News. \"I'm 26 and just now getting a job. I never knew what a W-2 was, or how you make [a] resume. They taught me everything.\" As he searches for more youth to participate in the program, McCoy said, \u201cWe're gonna go all over the area.\u201d Sylvan and other so-called \u201cfellows\" get to travel, too. One vacation shot shows Sylvan posing for the camera in Los Angeles, just one of the many excursions available to those who stay out of trouble. Other destinations include New York, Washington D.C., and even London. \u201cOur point is to connect with that young man in a very human way, to change that mindset that gives rise to destructive behavior,\u201d said program director DeVone Boggan with the Richmond Office of Neighborhood Services. \u201cServices don't stop bullets, but relationships can, and relationships do.\u201d Boggan said most of the 82 men who've gone through the program are still alive, and are not considered suspects in recent gun crimes. But critics say the Advance Peace program sends a bad message, and that if anyone should get money or trips, it should be the victims of violence.",

            "article_content": "Republican Warren Davidson won a lopsided victory Tuesday in the special election for the Ohio congressional seat left vacant by former House Speaker John Boehner after nearly 25 years. Davidson had 75 percent of the vote with 48 percent of precincts reporting from the six western Ohio counties, according to unofficial returns. It is Davidson's first election to office, after capturing his party's nomination in March. He topped a 15-candidate primary field in the heavily Republican district Boehner first won in 1990 after ousting a GOP incumbent in the primary. Democrat Corey Foister had 22 percent, and Green Party candidate Jim Condit Jr. had about 3 percent after a day of light voter turnout. Davidson will complete Boehner's term and be in a strong position to win the general election for a full term in the next Congress. Open seats have been rare in Ohio, which has very incumbent-friendly House districts. George Taylor, 74, of Hamilton, said he voted early, casting his ballot for Davidson because he likes his conservative views. \"We can't keep spending like this,\" Taylor said. \"Obamacare is a train wreck, and we've got some jobs back (since the recession), but not enough.\" Davidson, an Army veteran and businessman in Miami County, won the dual March primary for the special and general election nominations with about 32 percent of the vote in each. He ran as a conservative outsider, defeating two incumbent state legislators in the field. Davidson got key support from some former Boehner antagonists, such as Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and the conservative advocacy groups Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. Davidson has said people in the district considered it \"an honor\" to have the speaker from their home area, but that they are ready to have \"our own representative\" in Washington. Boehner defeated a scandal-marred Republican incumbent in the 1990 primary, and then won re-election, often with wide margins, every two years after his first election. Davidson and low-key Democrat Corey Foister, 26, a childhood cancer survivor who says he can do something about issues facing the nation's youth such as the high cost of education, offered contrasts during a recent forum at Miami University's Hamilton event center. Davidson spoke out strongly against abortion and new restrictions on gun ownership. Foister said he supports abortion rights and that more needs to be done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Condit is a frequent candidate running this year under the Green Party banner although Green Party members in Ohio have disavowed him. Green Party activists aren't sure whether they will get a candidate onto the November ballot, but Condit would have to run as a write-in because election officials disqualified him from running in the general election for the Green Party after voting in the Republican primary in March. Condit blames 9/11 on a conspiracy involving Israel to keep the United States involved in the Middle East and to take Americans' freedoms away in the name of national security. He also has voiced suspicions about the 2014 accidental death of James Traficant, an Ohio Democrat expelled from Congress after being convicted of taking bribes and kickbacks.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Louie Gohmert, (R-Texas), with the latest on the investigation into the IRS targeting scandal. House Republicans reached an agreement late Wednesday to avoid a potentially divisive floor vote on impeaching IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. The deal scraps the vote on the so-called \"privileged\" impeachment resolution that had been expected to take place Thursday. Instead, the House Judiciary Committee will consider Koskinen's impeachment, with the IRS boss expected to testify sometime next week. The agreement makes it unlikely that any vote by the full House to impeach Koskinen will happen until after the November election, if at all. House Republican leadership had balked on moving forward on impeachment proceedings during an election season, arguing that an impeachment vote risked irritating voters. Others said Koskinen deserved a full House Judiciary Committee probe before embarking on the seldom-used impeachment process. The effort by conservative Republicans flows from the IRS' 2013 admission that for several years, it had targeted Tea Party groups seeking tax exemptions for rigorous examinations. Conservatives say Koskinen obstructed the House GOP's investigation of the treatment of tea party groups seeking tax exemptions.\u00a0Koskinen and his Democratic allies say he did nothing wrong and provided Congress with all the information he had and knew about. The conservative House Freedom Caucus, which used a procedural maneuver to force a floor vote earlier this week, celebrated the development as a victory. \"This hearing will give every American the opportunity to hear John Koskinen answer under oath why he misled Congress, allowed evidence pertinent to an investigation to be destroyed, and defied Congressional subpoenas and preservation orders,\" the caucus said in a statement. \"It will also remove any lingering excuses for those who have been hesitant to proceed with this course of action.\" But the deal came only after conservatives predicted that their impeachment resolution was going to get sidelined by Democratic and Republican opposition Thursday.\u00a0Even if the House was able to send the resolution to the Senate, Democrats there have enough votes to prevent Republicans from removing Koskinen from office. The House needs only a simple majority vote to impeach a federal official, the equivalent of an indictment. The Senate then holds a trial and needs a two-thirds majority to find the official guilty and remove him or her from office. Fox News' Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jonathan Serrie reports from North Carolina Poll margins are too close for comfort in the swing state of North Carolina, forcing candidates in several races to campaign into the 11th hour for support in the coveted battleground. Donald Trump has scheduled an afternoon campaign event at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh. Hillary Clinton plans to appear with singer Madonna during a midnight rally at North Carolina State University. Monday morning, Quinnipiac University released a poll with Hillary Clinton leading Trump by just 2 percentage points (47 to 45) \u2014 a statistical tie. Races for governor and U.S. Senate are also tight in the state. The Quinnipiac Poll shows incumbent Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. and Democratic challenger Deborah Ross tied at 47 percent. In the gubernatorial race, Democrat Roy Cooper leads Republican Gov. Pat McCrory by 3 points (50 to 47 percent). \"North Carolina is a swing state, but in many ways it is a Republican swing state to lose,\u201d Jason Husser, a political science professor at Elon University, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIn order for a Democrat to win North Carolina, it has to be a particularly bad year for Republicans.\" The Senate candidates have accused each other of being rubber stamps for problematic presidential candidates at the top of their respective party tickets. But controversial legislation at the state level may also have an up-ballot effect. McCrory, who came to office as a business-friendly moderate in 2013, has seen his reelection bid turn into a virtual referendum on the state\u2019s voter ID law, which was tossed out by a federal appeals court, and House Bill 2 \u2014 a law that banned transgender individuals from using government building restrooms that correspond to their gender identity. \u201cHe has been associated with the most visible, and the most controversial, issues \u2014 rather than the legislature where all of this stuff got passed,\u201d said George Peery, Mars Hill University professor emeritus. Signed by McCory in March, House Bill 2 caused friction among two key Republican constituencies. Social conservatives rallied around the law, which they said protected women and children from sexual predators. But HB2 alienated many fiscal conservatives in the business community because of the negative economic consequences it caused. PayPal and other businesses have canceled expansion plans in the state to protest HB2. The NBA, ACC and NCAA have also moved some high-profile games out of the state. In the presidential race, Trump will need the support of both fiscal and social conservatives. Meanwhile, Clinton will need to rally African-American voters to the polls, whose numbers were down during the first week of early voting. And both campaigns have been making appeals to military voters. North Carolina is home to more than 99,000 active-duty service members and more than 775,000 veterans. \u201cIn North Carolina if you\u2019re not in the military, you either used to be in the military or you\u2019re related to somebody who used to be in the military,\u201d said Patricia Murphy, a columnist for The Daily Beast and Roll Call. \u201cSo, all of these issues \u2014 whether we\u2019re going to be fighting against ISIS, national security issues, military spending in particular \u2014 are very much on the minds of North Carolina voters.\u201d In a battleground state where Barack Obama beat John McCain by just 14,000 votes in the 2008 presidential election and then lost to Mitt Romney by 97,000 votes four years later, relatively small groups of voters can make a difference. Mauricio Castro, who organizes a non-partisan effort to get immigrants involved in the political process, said 25,000 new Latino voters have registered in North Carolina during this election cycle. \u201cWe have enough Latino eligible voters today to decide an election for governor, for senate and even to win the presidential elections,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take more than 14,000 votes to be able to win it.\u201d Fox News\u2019 David Lewkowict contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Final national poll before voters cast their ballots revealed on 'America's Newsroom' With one day before Election Day, Hillary Clinton has a four percentage-point lead over Donald Trump, according to the final Fox News national pre-election poll of likely voters. She\u2019s ahead by 48-44 percent, while Gary Johnson receives 3 percent and Jill Stein 2 percent. In the two-way race, it\u2019s also Clinton over Trump by 48-44 percent. Click here to read the poll results. Clinton\u2019s advantage is within the poll\u2019s margin of error in both the two-way and four-way races. The last Fox News Poll, released Friday, had Clinton ahead by two points in the four-way race and one point in the head-to-head matchup. Clinton is now winning among women by 12 points (52-40 percent), blacks by 85 (89-4 percent), Hispanics by 33 (63-30 percent), and voters under 30 by 16 (51-35 percent). That level of support is close to that of Barack Obama\u2019s winning coalition against Mitt Romney in 2012, when he won among women by 11 points (55-44 percent), blacks by 87 (93-6 percent), Hispanics by 44 (71-27 percent), and young voters by 23 (60-37 percent). Trump is favored among men by 5 points (48-43 percent), whites by 17 (54-37 percent), white evangelical Christians by 63 (78-15 percent), and whites without a college degree by 31 (61-30 percent). That nearly matches Romney\u2019s performance.\u00a0 He won men by 7 points (52-45 percent), whites by 20 (59-39 percent), white evangelicals by 57 (78-21 percent), and whites without a degree by 26 (62-36 percent). Trump is ahead of Clinton among veterans by 56-38 percent.\u00a0 She leads with first-time voters, by 48-42 percent. Nine percent of Republicans support Clinton.\u00a0 That\u2019s more than twice the number of Democrats backing Trump (four percent). And while Clinton garners more support among Democrats (91 percent) than Trump does among Republicans (86 percent), she trails among independents.\u00a0 They go for Trump by 42-36 percent, and 14 percent back Johnson or Stein.\u00a0 Independents went for Romney by 50-45 percent. \u201cRepublican partisans have mostly come home, but it looks to be too little, too late for Trump,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cUnless his voters are really shy, it seems his upwards trend has stalled just short of the goal line.\u201d Clinton\u2019s backers (61 percent) remain less likely than Trump\u2019s (68 percent) to \u201cstrongly\u201d support their candidate. Trump continues to best Clinton narrowly on being seen as honest and trustworthy (+4 points).\u00a0 At the same time, she significantly outperforms him on having the right temperament to serve as president (+23) and being qualified for the job (+18) -- plus, she has an advantage on personal favorability (+4). \u201cThe over 1-in-10 voters who don\u2019t like either candidate tend to think Clinton has the temperament and qualifications to be president, but Trump doesn\u2019t,\u201d says Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cAnd that looks to be the difference in the election.\u201d The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,410 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from November 3-6, 2016.\u00a0 The survey includes results among 1,295 likely voters.\u00a0 The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among both registered voters and likely voters.",

Sign up\u00a0here.** TRUMP\u2019S MIDNIGHT IN AMERICA SPEECHCLEVELAND \u2013 Speaking to the country at what he said was \u201ca moment of crisis for our nation,\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took his audience on a tour of a dark and dangerous America teetering at the brink. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Trump said. But we do have one hope: Electing him before it\u2019s too late. Trump vowed to break through the \u201ccarefully-crafted lies and the media myths\u201d that portray America as a safe, peaceful and prosperous country. The truth, Trump said, is that urban crime, terrorism, illegal immigration and unfair trade deals \u201cthreaten our very way of life.\u201d We\u2019ve had \u201cmorning in America,\u201d but as one attendee at the Quicken Loans Arena observed, Trump was talking about the nation at midnight. What made Trump\u2019s description of \u201cpoverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad\u201d even more ominous was that the true extent of the danger is being hidden. He said powerful interests are conspiring against ordinary Americans to not only perpetuate the problems for the benefit of the elite, but also to hide the extent of the calamity. Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cignored, neglected and abandoned\u201d average Americans was that he, as a master manipulator of the \u201crigged\u201d system, would be their advocate. \u201cI am your voice!\u201d was his repeated war cry as Trump vowed to do battle against the claque of international corporations and their political puppets who he said are intentionally allowing criminals, terrorists and immigrants to destroy the country and it\u2019s once prosperous middle class. \u201cNobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,\u201d Trump said. America has become Gotham City and Trump is ready to stop being billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and start being Batman. The solutions Trump offered could hardly be unpopular given that the burden fell only on the wicked. What person would oppose peace, prosperity, patriotism and \u201claw and order?\u201d What remains to be seen is whether enough voters agree with his depiction of the world. If you are a voter who believes that things are off course in America and need to be fixed this was not the speech for you. If you believe that it is 1968 all over again, then this was your candidate. This is in part a reflection of the growing dominance of social media and of Trump as its candidate. In the world of 2016, your vision of America can be carefully curated to meet your assumptions of the state of the union as dire or recovering. A Facebook homepage or Twitter feed can be pruned to affirm either world view. In Philadelphia next week, Democrats will create an alternate reality in which things are good but not great and only one more election away from bursting forth with prosperity and harmony for the land. Hillary Clinton wants you to believe that we are almost there. Trump wants you to believe that it\u2019s almost over. Most persuadable voters probably don\u2019t belong in either of these two camps. Trump\u2019s challenge, on which he made a hefty down payment Thursday, is to convince more people that things are worse than they think. Clinton\u2019s own onerous task is to make them believe that things are better than they really are. The backdrop for this pitched battle between a final hope in the face of oblivion and a technocratic nudge towards modest improvement is the endless character assaults between the two candidates. Clinton and Trump each say the other is unfit for office. But for Trump, Clinton is merely a symptom of the larger conspiracy against his voters. She is \u201ca puppet,\u201d not a supervillain. The end is near and she is just the final push that America needs to tumble over the cliff. For Clinton, Trump himself is the crisis. Her predictable warning next week will likely be that his wicked reign would put the world at risk. She will tell you that Trump is not Batman, but rather The Joker. Whatever you think of her, Democrats will argue, she is the nation\u2019s last hope to stop Trump from taking power and bringing chaos. Neither Trump nor Clinton is running as the candidate you like. They each want to be the candidate you\u2019re afraid not to vote for.

Residents were told not even to let their pets drink the water.

(Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal via AP) (The Associated Press) MEMPHIS, Tennessee \u2013 Hundreds of protesters angry over police killings of black people occupied a key bridge over the Mississippi River Sunday night, blocking an interstate highway for hours before officers moved them off. Traffic on Interstate 40 stopped in both directions after Black Lives Matter protesters marched onto the bridge. Police in squad cars tried to stop them, but several hundred had already made their way up the ramp, and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000. Interim police director Michael Rallings locked arms in solidarity with people marching off the bridge. Several hundred remained until riot police with shields slowly pushed them off. Earlier Sunday police kept watch on about 100 people honoring Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest in the city park where he is buried.",

            "article_content": "William Shemin, (l.) and Henry Johnson, (r.), are set to be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. (Shemin photo courtesy of family; Johnson photo courtesy U.S. Army) As night fell, U.S. Army Sgt. Henry Johnson found his observation post near Sainte-Menehould, France under siege by a dozen German soldiers. \u201cWith the most utter disregard for his own safety, (Shemin) sprang from his position in his platoon trench, dashed out across the open in full sight of the Germans, who opened and maintained a furious burst of machine gun and rifle fire.\u201d He fought them off until he ran out of ammunition, then used his rifle as a club, before taking on the rest hand-to-hand, with his bolo knife, eventually sending the enemy troops fleeing. Help didn't arrive until morning, on May 16, 1918, when Johnson, a member of the all-black \"Harlem Hellfighters\" 369th Infantry Regiment, was found badly wounded and near death. Just 21 at the time, Johnson would survive another decade before succumbing to alcoholism, broke and estranged from his family, in an Illinois veteran's hospital. On June 2, Johnson will be recognized by President Obama with the Medal of Honor, nation's highest military award. Honored along with Johnson will be Sgt. William Shemin, a Jewish soldier who bolted from his platoon's trench and ran into heavy enemy fire to save a wounded comrade. The White House ceremony is part of an ongoing effort to honor soldiers who may have been passed over due to race or religion. For years, Johnson's relatives, veterans and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have been pressing the case for Johnson, who also prevented badly injured fellow soldier Needham Roberts from being taken prisoner. Although Johnson was initially celebrated for his incredible bravery, receiving the Croix de Guerre with Gold Palm, one of the French military's highest honors, he faced racial discrimination upon his return to the U.S. and struggled with alcoholism, according to an account from the book \"Torchbearers of Democracy: African American Soldiers in the World War I Era.\" A similar campaign has long been in the works to award the Medal of Honor to Shemin. On Aug. 7, 1918, Shemin raced from the trench near Bazoches, France, and braved heavy fire in the open to rescue wounded comrades. In the ensuing hours and days, the 19-year-old soldier from New York took command of the platoon following the deaths of superior officers. He was shot in the head Aug. 9, but survived. \u201cWith the most utter disregard for his own safety, [Shemin] sprang from his position in his platoon trench, dashed out across the open in full sight of the Germans, who opened and maintained a furious burst of machine gun and rifle fire,\u201d according to one of Shemin\u2019s superiors, Capt. Rupert Purdon, who later wrote in support of a Medal of Honor. Shemin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation\u2019s second-highest military honor, but there was never an explanation of why he was denied the Medal of Honor. Shemin later earned a degree from Syracuse and started a greenhouse and nursery business in the Bronx. He died in 1973. Shemin's daughter, Elsie Shemin-Roth, who was involved in the campaign to honor Shemin's actions, will accept the medal on\u00a0 his behalf. Awarded personally be the presidemt, it was created in 1861 to recognize men who distinguished themselves \"conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity\" in combat. There have been 3,469 Medals of Honor awarded to date, with the largest percentage given to veterans of the Civil War.",

            "article_content": "Clinton supporters say digging up the story is nothing but a political stunt; Shannon Bream takes an in depth look for 'Special Report' One of America\u2019s top defense attorneys was deemed too controversial to host an event for President Obama, according to newly surfaced emails, mainly because of one particular client \u2013 a jet-setting billionaire accused of trafficking underage girls, who also happens to be close friends with Bill Clinton. Famed attorney Roy Black, 71, represented Jeffrey Epstein, 63, a Palm Beach finance mogul accused of trafficking for himself and his powerful friends nearly three-dozen underage girls for sex. Black, and his co-counsel Alan Dershowitz, secured a remarkable deal in 2008 in which Epstein pleaded guilty to one count related to prostitution with a minor, registered as a sex offender, and served, partly in home detention, just 13 months of a 19-month sentence. The Blacks' mansion was listed earlier  this year for $17 million. (MLS photo) A May 12 email chain posted on WikiLeaks showed Democratic National Committee leaders fretted that Black had hosted a fundraiser for Obama in 2007, and had been initially cleared in February to host a second fundraiser at his Miami Beach mansion, listed earlier this year for $17 million. But negative subsequent publicity as a result of representing Epstein gave party officials pause. \u201cWe were also asked to vet the following for POTUS hosting. The only issue is Roy Black. New issues have come up since his last vet in February 2016,\u201d wrote Kevin Snowden, deputy compliance director at the DNC. \u201cI lean no to (Black) hosting but could be ok with (him) attending,\u201d wrote back Alan Reed, also a deputy compliance director with the DNC. Epstein, (l.), and Clinton, (r.), flew dozens of times on the billionaire's jet, dubbed \"The Lolita Express.\" Black has been accused of no wrongdoing regarding Epstein, and was doing his job when he represented him. But while merely working for Epstein hurt Black\u2019s standing with the party, current Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a much closer association to Epstein. The email chain was last updated, the week FoxNews.com reported that former President Bill Clinton flew across the world on the billionaire\u2019s private jet, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express\u201d because of its reputation for orgies that reportedly took place on board. Clinton took more than 26 flights with Epstein across the world, including five trips for which flight logs show Clinton dismissed his U.S. Secret Service detail. Attorneys for Epstein have touted his close friendship with Clinton, claiming the billionaire helped start Clinton's family foundation and also hosted a trip to Africa in 2002 on his private Boeing 727 for the foundation, which Clinton himself attended, purportedly for an anti-AIDS and economic-development mission. Other articles detailing Black\u2019s representation of Epstein were sent through the DNC email chain, including a February 2016 Miami Herald report in which a former federal prosecutor on the case alleges government lawyers were \u201ccowed by Epstein\u2019s high-powered attorneys, including Roy Black,\u201d leading to Epstein\u2019s substantially reduced sentence. His only conviction was for abusing one 14-year-old girl, despite initially being accused by the FBI of victimizing 34 underage girls. A March 30, 2011, Palm Beach Daily News article reported Black disputed claims that he and other attorneys representing Epstein \u201cpried into federal prosecutors' personal lives in attempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender,\u201d and \"\u2019negotiated in bad faith,\u2019\" while attempting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors.\u201d The allegations, made by former U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta against Epstein\u2019s defense team, were contained in a three-page letter first published by The Daily Beast. In the letter, Acosta said Epstein\u2019s legal team looked for \u201cpersonal peccadilloes of prosecutors,\u201d and informed him \"the office's excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter,\u201d all during \"a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors.\u201d DNC officials also circulated articles on Black\u2019s other high-profile, controversial clientele, including conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, \u201cGirls Gone Wild\u201d founder Joe Francis, William Kennedy Smith of Kennedy family fame, Yankees star Alex Rodriguez and pop star Justin Bieber. A 2010 article in Page2Live.com reviewed the annual galas that Black, and his wife, \u201cReal Housewives of Miami\u201d star Lea Black, throw for charity, noting Black \u201ckicked off the open bar, three-course fiesta with this announcement to the 1,000-plus guests who'd paid up to $1,000 each: \u2018If you guys don't get drunk and dance on the tables, then this party has failed!\u2019\" The DNC emails were addressed to Robert \"Bobby\" Schmuck, special assistant to the president and deputy director of the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach at The White House\u2019s Executive Office of the President, via his government email address, and included members of Obama\u2019s campaign strategy team as well as a number DNC officials. Schmuck ultimately agreed with DNC officials on Black\u2019s status, writing \u201cNo hosting, fine to attend.\u201d",

            "article_content": "What new national polls reveal Donald Trump has had a few rocky weeks on the campaign trail, and it shows in the latest Fox News Poll.\u00a0 Just over half of Republicans would rather have someone besides Trump as their nominee, and his support in the presidential ballot test has dropped seven points since May. Democrat Hillary Clinton is up 44-38 percent over Trump in a head-to-head matchup.\u00a0 Earlier this month, Clinton had a three-point edge (42-39 percent).\u00a0 In May, Trump was up by three (45-42 percent).\u00a0 Clinton\u2019s current lead is just inside the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error. The national poll, released Wednesday, finds she has a similar advantage when voters are asked about confidence in the candidates to make the \u201cright\u201d decisions for the country if they were president:\u00a0 48 percent are at least somewhat confident Clinton would.\u00a0 It\u2019s 42 percent for Trump. In the matchup, Clinton is the choice among blacks (87-3 percent), women (51-32 percent), voters under age 45 (45-35 percent), and those earning less than $50,000 annually (52-30 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS Trump leads among white evangelical Christians (66-18 percent), whites without a college degree (51-33 percent), gun owners (52-30 percent), whites (48-34 percent), men (46-36 percent), and independents (39-31 percent). Since May, Trump has lost ground with Republicans (-8 points), whites without degrees (-10 points), and men (-9 points). The race is almost even among just those \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d interested in the election (45 Clinton to 43 Trump).\u00a0 This group went for Trump by four points in early June (45-41 percent). Party unity is a trouble spot for Trump.\u00a0 Just 74 percent of Republicans back him over Clinton, down from 82 percent in May.\u00a0 For comparison, Mitt Romney lost despite garnering 93 percent support among Republicans in 2012.\u00a0 In addition, just over half of Republicans would prefer a different nominee (51 percent someone else vs. 48 percent Trump).\u00a0 And while most GOP voters describe Trump as intelligent, more than 7-in-10 feel he\u2019s hot-headed and obnoxious.\u00a0 More on that later. Eighty-three percent of Democrats support Clinton in the ballot test.\u00a0 That\u2019s better than Trump does among Republicans, yet worse than the 92 percent backing President Obama received in 2012.\u00a0 By a 21-point margin, Democrats want Clinton (58 percent) as their party\u2019s nominee over Bernie Sanders (37 percent). Some 66 percent of Democrats who preferred Sanders are backing Clinton over Trump.\u00a0 By comparison, only 52 percent of Republicans who want someone else to lead their party support Trump over Clinton. Twenty-four percent of Republicans lack confidence that Trump would make the right decisions for the country.\u00a0 Fourteen percent of Democrats feel that way about Clinton. \"The results here aren't disastrous for Trump given the troubles he's encountered the past few weeks,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. \u201cHe's within striking distance.\u00a0 But he absolutely must combat the growing perception that he is temperamentally unsuited and intellectually unprepared to be president.\" What words best describe the candidates?\u00a0 There are a couple things voters generally agree on, and that\u2019s both Clinton and Trump are patriotic -- and lack honesty. Clinton outperforms Trump by the widest margin on \u201cexperienced,\u201d as 77 percent say that describes her, while just 34 percent feel the same of Trump. Far more see Clinton (82 percent) than Trump (66 percent) as \u201cintelligent,\u201d and \u201csensible\u201d (54 percent Clinton vs. 35 percent Trump). About six-in-ten think \u201cpatriotic\u201d fits each. Clinton is still dogged by low honesty numbers, as a record low 30 percent think she\u2019s \u201chonest and trustworthy,\u201d and 58 percent describe her as \u201ccorrupt.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t have much to brag about here either:\u00a0 just 34 percent describe him as \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d and 45 percent say \u201ccorrupt\u201d fits. Most voters feel Trump is \u201chot-headed\u201d (89 percent) and \u201cobnoxious\u201d (83 percent), while far fewer say those apply to Clinton (35 percent \u201chot-headed\u201d and 45 percent \u201cobnoxious\u201d). Less than half say the phrase \u201ccares about people like me\u201d describes Clinton (45 percent) and only about one third say it fits Trump (35 percent). \u201cWhile our polling shows a clear positive trend for Clinton, her six-point lead is notably small considering voters almost universally think Trump is hot-headed and obnoxious, and most think he\u2019s inexperienced,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThis race is nowhere close to breaking open, despite some huge perceived deficiencies in Trump\u2019s character.\u201d Pollpourri Libertarian Gary Johnson captures 10 percent in a hypothetical three-way vote.\u00a0 That causes both Clinton and Trump to lose ground, although for the most part she maintains her edge (41-36 percent).\u00a0 Another 14 percent is up for grabs. Fully 92 percent of those backing Clinton in the two-way race also back her in the three-way matchup.\u00a0 For Trump, 89 percent stick with him. The contest for the Congress looks similar to the presidential race.\u00a0 When voters are asked to choose between the Democratic and Republican candidates in their district, Democrats are up by five points, 46-41 percent. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,017 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from June 26-28, 2016.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Legal panel breaks down heated case from Texas The Supreme Court on Monday is poised to once again enter the fray on the abortion issue, an already divisive subject complicated by election-year politics and a split bench that may lack the votes to rule definitively. The high court will wrap up its work for the summer by issuing a judgment on how far Texas can go to regulate abortion clinics in the state, and whether those provisions have the effect of limiting first-trimester abortions guaranteed by the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.\u00a0Texas reproductive clinics are asking the justices to keep their facilities open in the face of the state restriction. Activists on both sides of the issue are expected to rally outside the court when the ruling is announced. A 4-4 tie would sustain the lower court's ruling, meaning a default victory for Texas, and likely for similar laws in other nearby states, including Louisiana and Mississippi. But no legal precedent would be established, leaving continued uncertainty nationwide. The Supreme Court could later hear new arguments in the case, when a ninth justice has been sworn in to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Tied rulings are becoming common for the post-Scalia court. The justices last week ruled 4-4 on a closely watched immigration case, dealing a setback to President Obama's executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. Scalia, who died in February, was perhaps the most outspoken of the current justices in regards to the abortion issue. A year ago, he, along with three other conservative members of the court, opposed issuing an order delaying enforcement of the Texas law while the case was being appealed. The four liberal justices -- along with swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy -- gave a temporary victory to the clinics in that case, allowing them to remain fully operational. It suggests there may now be five votes to ultimately strike down the Texas restrictions. The oral arguments from March were especially tense, though. Kennedy asked tough questions of both sides and did not tip his hand on how he would ultimately vote. If upheld, all clinics performing the abortion procedure in the state must operate as certified \"ambulatory surgical centers\" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority legislature have said the regulations contained in the 2013 law -- known as H.B. 2 -- would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups counter that the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. Only nine or 10 such health centers would qualify to stay open, and large areas west and south of San Antonio would have no full-time abortion providers. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. A federal judge initially concluded the \"ambulatory surgical centers\" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. But a federal appeal court ruled largely in favor of Texas. The clinics then asked the justices to finally decide the matter. \"There was a lot of talk at arguments about what impact this has on clinics,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department officials in the George W. Bush administration, now a private appellate attorney. \"So it could be the court is working behind the scenes to fashion some sort of compromise resolution where they basically punt, at least for the time being on the constitutional issue, and send the case back for more evidence gathering\" by the lower courts. But some court watchers on the progressive side worry what a tie vote would mean in the short term. \"It will definitely be a dramatic example of the problems of having a mere eight-justice court,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"And if the court splits 4-4 they will leave in place a difference of opinion, in the circuits [courts] below. That means women would enjoy their fundamental rights differently based on the state in which they live and this is not how our Constitution works.\" A Fox News poll from August revealed an even public split on the abortion issue, which has inevitably become enmeshed in presidential election-year politics. Among registered voters, 47 percent surveyed favor abortion rights or consider themselves \"pro-choice\" while 46 percent oppose the procedure or are \"pro-life.\" The number of abortions is at the lowest level since the Roe v. Wade decision, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute. The number remained steady at about 1.1 million reported procedures in the year 2011, down about 25 percent since the all-time high in 1990. Since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, about 53 million legal induced abortions were performed through 2011. What the Supreme Court decides Monday could ripple across other states and in Washington. The court has not ruled substantively on the abortion issue since 1992, when the justices said any such law could not place an \"undue burden\" on women's access to abortions. The swing vote, as in previous cases, came from Kennedy. It appears inevitable his vote will again prove crucial in the Texas dispute. This appeal could effectively be set aside as a political and legal issue in 2016 if the high court is unable to muster a binding majority. By next spring, a new president, and possibly a new member of the high court would then reset the abortion debate in a post-Scalia era.",

President Obama skirted the law and broke precedent to swap a captured American soldier for five \u201chigh risk\u201d Islamist militants in U.S. custody. The deal with enemy forces in Afghanistan is a continuation of Obama\u2019s effort to get all U.S. forces out of Afghanistan within two years. This is part of a new, more limited foreign policy approach that Team Obama refers to as \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid sh*t.\u201d But some people think this sh*t is pretty stupid. The move is highly controversial, even aside from the legal questions of Obama again circumventing Congress. Former comrades of the freed American believe that he deserted the Army amid a difficult forward deployment, adding additional danger to their mission as they were dispatched to search for him. The soldier\u2019s father further complicated things with his remarks with the president in the Rose Garden Saturday, in which he praised Allah and spoke Pashto, the language of the Taliban. So what does the person most likely to succeed Obama as president think about all of this? [WSJ provides details about the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay who were released, while Reuters reports that Afghan officials have said the freed Islamist militants will definitely go back to the fight.] Privileged conversations - Democratic 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton is campaigning today in Colorado, a swing state where she is struggling with voters. (The Clinton campaign commitment to Colorado will also extend to a three-day Denver event at the end of this month paid for by the corporate backers of her family\u2019s foundation and featuring big names like NBC News\u2019 David Gregory.) The Denver Post reports that today\u2019s events will include stops to tout worker training programs at a plastics factory, meetings with local power brokers and a big speech in suburban Broomfield. Clinton scrubbed an event hosted by a chemical industry trade group amid protests from liberals about the group\u2019s involvement in fracking, but she will still be spending a lot of time today campaigning in a key state. Will reporters find a way to press her on her view of the Taliban prisoner deal? Or the unraveling of Libya? Or new global warming regulations from the Obama Administration? Or fracking? Or anything? The big speech tonight is being co-sponsored by The Denver Post, so perhaps its reporters could find a way to get substantive answers. But one suspects that the Clinton strategy of using the trappings of celebrity to insulate the candidate from normal scrutiny will continue to be in force. [Pro-GOP group America Rising is releasing \u201cFailed Choices\u201d to rebut the claims Hillary makes in her forthcoming book \u201cHard Choices.\u201d] Warren not denying a possible bid to block Clinton\u2019s path - Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., gives a blushing, non-denial when asked by HuffPo about a possible presidential run, but did denounce \u201cconcentrated money and power,\u201d seemingly a swipe at the Clintons. Can Obama show muscles in Brussels? - Today, President Obama begins a four-day European trip that includes efforts to reassure nervous allies that the U.S. remains opposed to further territorial advances by Russia. Obama will also have trade negotiations with the leaders of other countries with large economies and pay his respects Friday at Normandy, France for the 70th anniversary of the Allied invasion of occupied Europe. THE DEM HARDEST HIT BY OBAMA GLOBAL WARMING REGS President Obama is set to announce new global warming regulations on power plants today that would cut allowable emissions of carbon dioxide by nearly a third in the years to come. If the rules go fully into effect, the use of coal, which produces more than 40 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity, would be severely limited. The expected replacement, natural gas, is likely to prove more expensive for consumers and is far less labor intensive, meaning higher costs and fewer jobs. While the move is exciting many in the president\u2019s political base and helping to polish Obama\u2019s legacy as a foe of carbon emissions, the consequences will be harsh for several of his fellow Democrats, especially those in red states and those with high energy costs already. But for one Democratic Senate hopeful, Obama\u2019s decision to crack down on coal may burn away any hope of a victory. Kentucky woman - Previously, President Obama argued that his environmental policies did not constitute a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d but the new emissions targets out today make it clear that not only is Obama at war with the coal industry, but that\u2019s he\u2019s winning. That\u2019s very bad news for Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state who was once favored to defeat incumbent Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Coal is important to Kentucky\u2019s economy and has an even more important role in the state\u2019s identity. Plus, the counties outside of Louisville traditionally most hospitable to Democrats are the coal-producing counties of Eastern Kentucky. The transparency of this move against coal makes Grimes\u2019 argument that she can be a better advocate for the industry as a Democrat moot. RNC offers greatest hits from Obama\u2019s coal war - The Republican National Committee released a web video highlighting Democrats\u2019 war on coal. \u201cAgainst Coal, Against Jobs\u201d features clips of President Obama saying, \u201cIf they want to build coal-fired plant they can it\u2019s just that it will bankrupt them,\u201d and Senate Majority leader Harry Reid\u2019s \u201ccoal makes us sick,\u201d contrasted with West Virginia Senate GOP \u00a0candidate Shelley Moore Capito\u2019s, R-W. Va., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s calls for an all of the above policy that includes coal. But Tom Steyer will be pleased -\u00a0 WaPo: \u201cThe regulations\u2026 will shine a spotlight on a growing division within the Democratic Party: On one side are major donors, who take a particular interest in environmental causes and are becoming increasingly important to the party. On the other are the candidates whose fates will decide control of the Senate and who hail from energy-producing states, where regulations on coal-fired power plants could have the most detrimental effects.\u201d WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...If you can afford it, that is. Coffee prices have skyrocketed in recent months thanks to a double whammy of a drought in Brazil coupled with the spread of a destructive fungus that afflicts coffee plants in Central America. As AP reports, some Central American farmers have seen their yields fall 95 percent as the fungus, known as \u201ccoffee rust\u201d ravages their crops. We know that coffee and its cultivation have shaped world events for a long time, but what will the consequences be of this latest shortage? National Geographic suggests that the unmatched American devotion to coffee may override the growing movement away from genetically modified agricultural products. But even if that works, the lengthy timeframe for such a fix may have permanently changed the economy of coffee. Says NatGeo: \u201cMany experts wonder if the process, unfolding over many seasons \u2013 some years without any yield at all \u2013 will drive farmers to try to find other work.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and state Sen. Chris McDaniel matters to you: \u201c[T]he election Tuesday could also be shaped by something no one foresaw -- voter response to a blogger scandal that has put the race in flux. With polls showing a neck-and-neck race, a new question now looms: Will this recent development help six-term Sen. Thad Cochran survive the political fight of his life and beat back Tea Party-backed challenger Chris McDaniel?... Operatives in the state say the issue could mobilize voters in both camps. Those supportive of McDaniel and outraged by the Cochran team\u2019s attacks may be more energized to turn out on Tuesday. And Cochran backers may now be more tuned in to the race and could mobilize in response to the apparent invasion of privacy he experienced. \u2026 Outside groups have spent over $7 million in this race so far, with the majority of it tilted toward McDaniel, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. But the likely outcome remains unclear heading into the primary, which has captured national attention and may provide insight into the state of the GOP in Mississippi and beyond, and whether seniority can trump cries for a fresh face.\u201d POLL: TIGHT BATTLE FOR REPUBLICANS IN CALIF GOV RACEThough far outdistanced in the deep blue state by incumbent Gov. Jerry Brown, D-Calif., the race among the GOP candidates seeking to take him on in November has become a dead heat just days before Tuesday\u2019s primary, according to a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times\u00a0poll. \u00a0Brown garnered 50% of the likely voters polled, while GOP establishment favorite Neel Kashkari drew 18% while insurgent hard line conservative Tim Donnelly trailed at 13%. The difference between the two vying for the second slot in the general election was within the poll's margin of error. [New at Fox News Opinion - Fox News Contributor Ric Grenell goes off on Donnelly: \u201cA Donnelly nomination this week would further denigrate the Golden State\u2019s long-suffering GOP. It\u2019s been difficult enough for California Republicans to offer a compelling alternative to the Democrats\u2019 hyper-liberal government agenda. Tarring their image by nominating an offensive, corrupt and amoral candidate like Donnelly will only make the party\u2019s job harder than it already is.\u201d] ERNST HOGGING THE LEAD IN IOWADes Moines Register: \u201cSelf-described \u2018mother, soldier, conservative\u2019 Joni Ernst is a convincing 18 points ahead of her closest GOP rival, \u2018proven business leader\u2019 Mark Jacobs, in the Republican race for U.S. Senate, a new Des Moines Register Iowa Poll shows. Her support from 36 percent of likely GOP primary voters, which doubles Jacobs' 18 percent, would be enough to win Tuesday's five-person primary outright. The victor needs at least 35 percent.\u201d Rubio rallies for Ernst - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., will be in the Hawkeye State to campaign for Joni Ernst ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary.

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Washington Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on the FBI Friday to release all information in its renewed investigation into her use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails \u2013 apparently during the probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting \u2013 in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. \"[FBI Director James Comey] himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails ... are significant or not,\" Clinton told reporters in Iowa Friday evening. \"I\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it\u2019s imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.\" Earlier Friday, Comey informed top members of Congress in a letter that the bureau had \u201clearned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ THE LETTER Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced \u201cin connection with an unrelated case.\u201d An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced ex-Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI\u2019s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, \u201cGood grief,\u201d after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. The Clinton campaign called the decision to revisit the case so close to the election \u201cextraordinary,\u201d and urged Comey to provide more details. Comey gave only a brief overview in his letter to lawmakers of what prompted their decision. He wrote that the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, \u201cand I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete \u201cthis additional work.\u201d 1,000 CLINTON-PETRAEUS EMAILS MISSING FROM RECORDS SENT TO STATE, FBI FILES SHOW FBI, DOJ ROILED BY DECISION TO LET CLINTON SLIDE, SAY SOURCES The move comes after Comey and the Justice Department decided in July not to pursue charges over Clinton's email practices, saying at the time that the investigation was finished. Comey later came under criticism from Trump, GOP lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during Clinton's tenure. Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the \u201ccourage\u201d to \u201cright the horrible mistake that they made\u201d \u2013 saying he hopes that is \u201ccorrected.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d In a nod to the significance of the FBI\u2019s announcement, Trump quipped: \u201cThe rest of my speech is going to be so boring.\u201d Other GOP lawmakers also weighed in, urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the discovery must be \u201cserious\u201d for the bureau to investigate this close to the election. Clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city. But Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta sharply questioned the FBI's move and said Comey should \"immediately provide\" more information. \"Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,\u201d he said in a statement. Podesta said \u201cwe have no idea what those emails [that have come to light] are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d According to a source connected to the Clinton campaign who spoke to law enforcement, the FBI has four devices \u2013 one belongs to Abedin, and at least one belongs to Weiner. So far, no classified information has been found on the devices, Fox News is told. The development comes 11 days before the general election, and is the latest shockwave to hit the race. Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him which he denies. However, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat's campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem. Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were \"livid\" at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation. \"He lit her on fire and then walked away,\" Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton's mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges. Hosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision \"based on what they have\" at the time. Hosko said he thinks agents found emails that made them say, \"Oh my God look at what we have.\" BREAKING NEWS \u2192 The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton.My full statement \u21e9 pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk House Speaker Paul Ryan called the FBI decision \"long overdue.\" But former Obama administration spokesman Tommy Vietor chided the bureau on Twitter.

While Clinton appears to have paths to the total needed for election without Ohio, the state\u2019s 20 votes are considered crucial for Trump. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 After a week of revelations and allegations about Donald Trump's behavior toward women, a third party twist lends an unprecedented level of uncertainty to one conservative stronghold. The Associated Press this week moves Utah to a tossup after recent polls there showed a narrowing gap between the Republican nominee and Democrat Hillary Clinton. While Clinton may not have much upside in a state defined by its relationship with the Mormon church, support for independent Evan McMullin and Libertarian Gary Johnson adds unpredictability to usually Republican Utah. Two polls conducted in Utah this week, by Monmouth University and Y2 Analytics, showed a 6-point Trump lead and a tie between Trump and Clinton. But both surveys showed McMullin not far behind, earning support from about 2 in 10 likely voters, and Johnson from about 1 in 10. In both polls, about 7 in 10 Utah voters expressed an unfavorable view of the major party nominees. After the release of a 2005 video of Trump making sexually predatory comments to \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush, the Church of Latter-day Saints-owned Deseret News newspaper published an editorial calling for the GOP nominee to step aside, saying, \"What oozes from this audio is evil.\" McMullin, who is still mostly unknown to Utah voters, appears to have the greatest potential to capitalize on distaste for the GOP nominee. Though running as an independent, he's a Republican and a Mormon, born in Utah and a graduate of Brigham Young University. The AP analysis is of the map as it stands today. It considers preference polling, recent electoral history, demographic trends and campaign priorities such as advertising, travel and on-the-ground staff. AP also this week moves the 2nd Congressional Districts in Maine and Nebraska to toss-ups. Both states award a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. Polls show Clinton ahead of Trump nationally, and she maintains edges in enough states to win the White House if she can hold on to her current leads. ___ SOLID DEMOCRATIC: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state (200 total electoral votes).

            "article_content": "Demarcus Davis was seen brandishing the stolen weaponry on an online video, according to police. (Screengrab) A former \u201cSons of Guns\u201d reality TV star did a double-take last month when he clicked on a link that said, \u201cRapper Threatens Trump\u201d and instantly recognized his distinctively customized firearms being waved around by a local wannabe. \u201cAs I\u2019m watching it, I\u2019m thinking these guns are very recognizable,\u201d Joe Meaux,whose Baton Rouge store, Meaux Guns and Ammo, was burglarized in July, 2015. \u201cAs I watched more, I realized that they were very familiar. They were stolen from me last year.\u201d By the time Meaux called police, he said local authorities and the Secret Service were already aware of the Instagram video featuring Demarcus Davis, 22, a local rapper who goes by \u201cMaine Musik.\u201d While they may not have known the guns were stolen, the federal agency takes any threat to a presidential candidate very seriously. Meaux starred on the Discovery show \"Sons of Guns\" until it was canceled when his business partner was hit with child sex charges. (Courtesy: Joe Meaux) \u201cI really want to go to war with Donald Trump because Donald Trump is tryin\u2019 to take food stamps from my momma and that\u2019s all the (expletive) she got,\u201d Davis said on the video. \u201cLet Donald Trump know it\u2019s up over here. We want war; we\u2019re going to declare war.\u201d Later in the video, Davis makes an ambiguous reference to ISIS. \u201cI ain\u2019t worried about ISIS,\u201d Davis said on camera. \u201cThey just called me and want me to f**k with them now. You heard me, we\u2019ve got them drums and grenades but I\u2019m scared to throw them.\u201d Davis was nabbed on June 3, when he ran a stop sign in Baton Rouge, according to police. There was a warrant out for his arrest stemming from an undisclosed 2015 incident. \u201cDavis was stopped for traffic violation,\u201d Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola said. \u201cIt was at that time that we learned that he was wanted and then he was taken into custody at that time.\u201d Davis was booked on multiple weapons counts and a drug charge, police said. He posted $23,000 bail and was released the same day, according to online records. While his charges include possession of stolen guns, Davis is not currently suspected of taking part in a burglary blitz of Baton Rouge gun shops last summer that included an audacious heist at Meaux\u2019s store. Three men are facing prosecution for those break-ins. The Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment. Meaux said his guns, stolen when thieves bored into the side of the Mammoth Avenue building after hours, were easy to spot. \u201cMy guns are all very recognizable, we do a lot of custom work,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was one Ak-47 copy built from a .22 I identified. Everything from the optic to the way the sling was placed was all very identifiable.\u201d In addition to the videos featuring allegedly stolen guns, investigators found a photo of Davis holding a stolen customized Ruger 10/22 Krinker Plinker on his public Facebook page, sources said. His Instagram account, which has 53,000 followers, still shows photographs of him posing with other guns. \u201cMany of the items have been recovered, but the matter is still under investigation so when that is completed we will hopefully get them back,\u201d Meaux said. \u201cBut the most important thing is that they are off the streets now.\u201d A store Meaux previously ran, Red Jacket Firearms, was for several seasons the centerpiece of the Discovery show \u201cSons of Guns.\u201d The show was canceled in 2014 after co-owner Will Hayden was charged with raping a minor. Davis, who could not be reached for comment and did not have an attorney listed on court documents, is back on the streets awaiting his next legal hearing. And in a new video posted to his Instagram account on Wednesday, he had traded in stolen guns for a knife. \u201cF**k Donald Trump,\u201d Davis says on screen as he walks through an urban neighborhood, waving a large blade. \u201cNo more guns\u2026 It\u2019s our summer 16, b*tch.\u201d Jamie Brennan contributed to this report",

He also tweeted Tuesday evening about voting issues in Utah. Those issues aside, much of the country experienced a relatively smooth Election Day. At the New Life United Methodist Church in Virginia, people waited outside for a machine to be fixed early Tuesday morning but by midday, operations were running smoothly. The Virginia Department of Elections reported only two late openings in more than 2,400 polling places. A dozen places had routine equipment issues and there were a \u201ccouple of issues with scanning machines,\u201d a statement said. Some people were forced to switch to paper ballots which would be counted once a replacement scanner went out, the DOE said, adding there had been a few touchscreen issues. By midafternoon in Alexandria, Virginia, there were more poll workers than voters at McArthur Elementary School, though earlier in the day, the lines were long. In and around the country\u2019s capital, lines snaked around many polling places in the morning but had evened out throughout the day, though election officials told FoxNews.com that they expected a rush later. It was largely the same up north. In New Jersey, one voter reported waiting three hours because there were too few voting machines at her polling place in Jersey City, while in Brooklyn, New York, one voter spent an hour in line to cast her vote. The well-prepared voter told FoxNews.com she \u201cwas expecting a bit of a wait so I brought a book.\u201d In Texas, a computer used by election clerks malfunctioned at a polling place inside a high school in suburban Houston, forcing officials to briefly divert voters to another polling place more than two miles away. Fort Bend County Elections Administrator John Oldham said the malfunctioning console was later replaced with a backup and voting resumed. Andrea Patience, a 50-year-old pharmacy technician, was among those standing in line when the computer malfunctioned. She said she waited an hour for it to be fixed. Patience said as many as 100 people were standing in line at the time, and about half of them left. \"There were a lot of upset people,\" Patience said. \"I don't know if they will come back later or decide not to vote.\" In Michigan, Fox 2 reported receiving dozens of phone calls and emails from voters claiming the machines at their polling places weren\u2019t working correctly. The station reported that \u201can overwhelming number of voters from several cities\u201d report their machine wasn't able to accept the ballot so they have had to leave them with election officials. Some in Detroit, Sterling Heights, Novi, Holly and Roseville said the machines have malfunctioned altogether or complained of them jamming. Election officials in Utah said voting machine problems in the southern part of the state forced poll workers early in the day to use paper ballots. A computer problem in Durham County, North Carolina -- a Democratic stronghold in a state that has been a key battleground in the presidential race -- triggered long lines when election officials had to rely on a paper check-in process. There were also sporadic reports of people in North Carolina who said they were not put on the voter rolls despite registering to vote through the Division of Motor Vehicles. The question this year was whether problems would be widespread and indicate a pattern of fraud or voter intimidation. Trump had suggested that Philadelphia was among those places ripe for voter fraud. The city's district attorney, Seth Williams, said in mid-afternoon that his office had investigated 68 complaints about voter intimidation, broken machines or other problems, a number consistent with the past three presidential elections. He said all had proven unfounded. In the last week alone, Democrats went to court in seven states seeking to halt what they claim were efforts by Republicans and the Trump campaign to deploy a network of poll watchers hunting for voter fraud. Republicans have disputed claims they are planning to intimidate voters, and judges largely found no evidence of efforts to suppress voters. While there were concerns that the heated rhetoric of the campaign would lead to confrontations at the polls, only a few minor skirmishes were reported. This is the first presidential election in which a key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in place. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down a portion of the law that had required certain states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to receive pre-approval from the U.S. Department of Justice for any election law change. This allowed a number of states, most led by Republican legislatures and governors, to enact strict voter ID laws and reduce early voting. Legal challenges to some of those voter ID laws have led to a multitude of court rulings in recent months that blocked or struck down some provisions while upholding or reinstating others. That triggered concerns of misinformation among voters, election officials and poll workers. The Supreme Court ruling also prompted the Justice Department to send fewer trained election observers to polling places around the country than in previous years, with the reduction likely to diminish the department's ability to detect voter intimidation and other potential problems. Meanwhile, state election officials were guarding against any attempt to breach their systems. Previously, some 33 states accepted an offer from the federal government to check their voter databases and reporting systems for vulnerabilities after hackers attempted to access systems in two states over the summer.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama speaks about the Baton Rouge, La., shooting of police officers, Sunday, July 17, 2016, from the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Obama on Wednesday cut short the sentences of 214 federal inmates, including 67 life sentences, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. Almost all the prisoners were serving time for nonviolent crimes related to cocaine, methamphetamine or other drugs, although a few were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. Almost all are men, though they represent a diverse cross-section of America geographically. Obama's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the U.S. needs to remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing requirements that put tens of thousands behind bars for far too long. Obama has used the aggressive pace of his commutations to increase pressure on Congress to pass a broader fix and to call more attention to the issue. All told, Obama has commuted 562 sentences during his presidency -- more than the past nine presidents combined, the White House said. Almost 200 of those who have benefited were serving life sentences. \"All of the individuals receiving commutation today -- incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws -- embody the president's belief that `America is a nation of second chances,\"' White House counsel Neil Eggleston wrote in a blog post. Eggleston said Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programming or counseling. He called on Congress to finally pass a criminal justice overhaul to bring about \"lasting change to the federal system.\" Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently at the end of their presidencies, and Obama administration officials said the rapid pace would continue during Obama's final months. \"We are not done yet,\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\" Most of those receiving commutations Wednesday will be released December 1. Though there's broad bipartisan support for a criminal justice overhaul, what had looked like a promising legislative opportunity for Obama's final year has mostly fizzled. As with Obama's other priorities, the intensely political climate of the presidential election year has confounded efforts by Republicans and Democratic in Congress to find consensus. Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With Obama's support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. The Obama administration has also expanded criteria for inmates applying for clemency, prioritizing nonviolent offenders who have behaved well in prison, aren't closely tied to gangs and would have received shorter sentences if they had been convicted a few years later. Civil liberties groups praised that policy change but have pushed the Obama administration to grant commutations at a faster pace. The Clemency Resource Center, part of NYU School of Law, said more than 11,000 petitions are pending at the Justice Department and that the group believes 1,500 of them meet the administration's criteria to be granted. But the calls for greater clemency have sometimes sparked accusations from Obama's opponents that he's too soft on crime, an argument that is particularly resonant this year as presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton trade claims about who is best positioned to keep the country safe. \"Many people will use words today like leniency and mercy,\" said Kevin Ring of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. \"But what really happened is that a group of fellow citizens finally got the punishment they deserved. Not less, but at long last, not more.\"",

Unless the president has a proposed law or action to take on the subject, jawboning on the subject seems very unlikely to change many minds on the subject. If the much more fraught case of Trayvon Martin couldn\u2019t change the national discourse, how is the Ferguson storyline going to do it? Obama\u2019s supporters have become kind of like Steely Dan aficionados, believing that if the unconvinced will just listen to \u201cBodhisattva\u201d just one more time, they too will be moved by the sound. But that\u2019s not how it works. Unless the president has something new to say, he is unlikely to get a new hearing from a skeptical nation. And based on the president\u2019s schedule today, there\u2019s not much new to come. [NYT Pentagon Correspondent Helene Cooper on NBC News discussing race riots: \u201cAs long as black people continue to feel that you cannot walk down the street without coming under suspicion, this anger is going to continue.\u201d]Shiny object alert - The president is slated for a full day of symbolic meetings on the issue of law enforcement in minority communities, including a cabinet meeting addressing the subject of \u201cmilitarization\u201d of police departments. The topic has political appeal across the spectrum, but that doesn\u2019t speak to what protestors are shutting down malls and highways at rush hour about. The claim from the Ferguson protesters is that police can kill black men with impunity and that \u201cblack lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d Obama is talking past those calling for action on that front. The militarization argument might come into play on the response to the protests, but certainly not their underlying cause. That is raw, divisive and cannot be addressed with a single executive order or even a single bill. Obama will also hold meetings with civil rights leaders and then law enforcement figures. But again, the question remains: To what end? [One of the prosed solutions for ethnic tensions between officers and citizens is to have more black officers. But as Heather Mac Donald has observed, some of the worst civil rights abuses have come from majority-black departments like New Orleans and Detroit.]That\u2019s soooo 2008\u2026 - The expectation that Obama is a magical being whose words and mere presence can bring healing and calm \u2013 a misconception he aggressively encouraged in his earlier days \u2013 create an impossible situation for the president. As long as there are those who believe that if Obama could just give the right speech and say the right sequence of words that these problems would abate, the president will always somehow be falling short of the mark. In reality, the president doesn\u2019t have many options when it comes to how local police and the residents of crime-wracked neighborhoods interact. The time for him to give \u2018major speeches\u201d to change the national discussion faded with his early clout as president. Now, he can talk but would be hard pressed to make the nation listen. And unless there is some policy prescription the president has roused himself to offer, this will be no exception.CONGRESS RETURNS AS CLIFF LOOMSCongress is back and so is the S-word, as in \u201cshutdown\u201d. \u00a0Lame duck lawmakers face a packed agenda and a looming Dec. 11 government funding deadline. In an atmosphere tainted by President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, Republican have been considering countermoves ranging from leveraging a shutdown \u2013 pushed by conservatives who want to defund Obama\u2019s amnesty edict \u2013 to full-funding through the current fiscal year, which party leaders say showcases the GOP\u2019s ability to govern. There\u2019s even a blended option afoot: Incoming House Budget Committee Rep. Tom Price last week floated a strategy that would fund most of the government through September 2015, like an omnibus, but would only fund immigration-related services for a few months. \u00a0Price sees it as a way to avoid a government shutdown, while blocking President Obama\u2019s executive action. \u00a0With the clock ticking and crucial items like renewal of tax breaks and defense funding on the to-do list, whichever tactical moves lawmakers employ will have little time to play out. [While Jonah Goldberg and A.B. Stoddard think the move unlikely, Goldberg made the point that if Republicans plan to use a shutdown as leverage, better to do so now than kick-the-can down the road. Watch their Power Play discussion with Chris Stirewalt, here.]Power Play: Cuellar on executive action - Immigration reform advocates have been rejoicing over President Obama\u2019s executive action which temporarily shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.

After nearly two decades spent trying to launch his own career as a jazz pianist and songwriter in Chicago, New York and Hollywood, Rose headed south to Nashville in 1942. There, he partnered with Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff to establish the first music publishing house devoted to country music. Famous for square dealing and understanding country artists, it quickly became a major industry force. But Rose\u2019s skills at songwriting and developing artists proved so formidable that within three years, he brought his son aboard to handle the business side. Thank God he did. One of Roses\u2019 first projects was Hank Williams, who early on showed his own gifts as a songwriter. Their partnership helped bring forth much of Williams catalogue and make Williams an icon before his untimely death in 1953. Rose\u2019s list of songwriting credits includes eternal favorites like \u201cNo One Will Ever Know\u201d and many more, including several crossover hits. Rose would die from a heart attack on this date in 1954, leaving an unparalleled legacy in the business and art of country music. Rose was posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, along with Williams.

If it came to that, it would be a difficult decision.\u2019\u201dCONSUMERS DEFY OBAMACARE ARCHITECTS\u2019 EXPECTATIONSA persistent set of problems for ObamaCare relates to missed expectations of incentives. One of the assumptions of the law was that beneficiaries would seek to save money each year by shopping around for the lowest premiums, creating incentives for insurance companies, like airlines, to offer lower rates. But your family doctor is not a flight to Des Moines and switching policies is not as simple as logging on to Kayak. The New Yorker explains how flawed thinking from the law\u2019s architects could further hamper promised savings: \u201cWhen switching costs are high, it\u2019s much easier for companies to raise prices. If you have a storage unit, you may well have been lured by an attractive monthly rate, only to find that it soon started rising by significant increments. (What are you going to do? Move all your stuff?) Similarly, even though there are lots of affordable new Obamacare plans this year, many of last year\u2019s are raising premiums substantially.\u201d [In the latest Gallup poll, 33 percent of Americans say they have delayed medical care for themselves or family members due to the costs.]Low turnout for ObamaCare small business program - WaPo: \u201cA year after the Obama administration\u00a0temporarily shelved\u00a0an unfinished part of HealthCare.gov intended for small businesses, it has opened with reports of only modest technical flaws, but with doubts that it will soon benefit the millions of workers at little companies with inadequate health insurance or none at all\u2026\u201dBLUE TEAM, INDEEDOn a bookstore shopping photo-op Saturday, President Obama spied a display of a book by NBC News anchor Chuck Todd with a cover featuring a photo of the president walking away with his eyes downcast, \u201cLet\u2019s see what Chuck has to say,\u201d the president said as he leaned closer. \u201cThe Stranger, Barack Obama in the White House,\u201d he read aloud. \u201cHow is he already writing a book?\u201d Malia asked her father, with a smile. \u201cLooking lonely.

Students were escorted back into the building after a teacher at the Hertfordshire school spotted the rambunctious rodent wreaking havoc on the playground. No children were hurt in the incident, though one staff member received a scratch. Head teacher Amrit Bal-Richards is monitoring the situation though the ferocious fellow hasn\u2019t been seen since, saying, \u201cThe incident was a couple of weeks ago, since then we have not actually seen the squirrel. Safeguarding children is paramount. It is uncommon for a squirrel to actually demonstrate aggressive behavior but we are aware of the situation.\u201d The school held an assembly for students to discuss the incident and what to do in the future if squirrels or other animals become agitated or threatened.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0 Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

            "article_content": "'The O'Reilly Factor' examines reports that the probe shows emails contained classified drone strike information The paperback version of Hillary Clinton\u2019s memoir \u201cHard Choices\u201d fails to include her support of the international trade pact TPP that rivals Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have opposed, raising criticism about Clinton \u201creinventing herself\u201d for the general election race. The paperback version of Clinton\u2019s 2014 book, which details her work as secretary of state for President Obama, omits the passage in which she touts her efforts to get the country to support the 12-nation trade deal, which she once referred to as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for such agreements. \u201cWe worked hard to improve and ratify trade agreements with Colombia and Panama and encouraged Canada and the group of countries that became known as the Pacific Alliance -- Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile -- all open-market democracies driving toward a more prosperous future to join negotiations with Asian nations on TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement,\u201d Clinton says in the hardback version about a 2009 effort. However, Clinton changed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership in October 2015, about a month after the deal was signed and after weeks of being pressed by the news media for an answer. A total 96 pages were trimmed from the hardback version. Publisher Simon & Schuster said a \u201climited number of sections\u201d were cut to \u201caccommodate a shorter length for this edition,\" according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which reported on the changes shortly after the paperback edition was released in April. \u201cThat Clinton's own memoir is reinventing itself for the general election shows the lengths she will go to mislead the American people,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short told DailyMail.com, which along with The International Business Times earlier this week picked up on the changes and reported them. The Clinton campaign declined Saturday to comment. The Obama administration says TPP attempts to help American entrepreneurs, farmers and small business owners sell products on the international market by eliminating roughly 18,000 taxes and others \u201ctrade barriers\u201d that \u201cput American products at an unfair disadvantage.\u201d Democratic primary candidate Sen. Bernie Sander has said the deal and its accompanying Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are \u201cdisastrous\u201d and need to be renegotiated -- in large part because of their potential to kill millions of U.S. jobs and negative environmental impact. Clinton, now the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, also supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by husband President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and criticized by Trump, the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee. Trump, a billionaire businessman, says he supports free trade but has been highly critical of the TPP, calling it a \u201chorrible deal\u201d in part because, he argues, it continues to allow such countries as China to continue \u201ccurrency manipulation.\u201d \u201cThis is one of the worst trade deals,\u201d Trump said during the Fox Business Channel/ Wall Street Journal debate in November 2015. \u201cI\u2019d rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better. ... We\u2019re losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: Dana Perino, co-anchor of \u201cThe Five\u201d recently read the new book, \u201cWe the People,\u201d written by Juan Williams, her fellow co-host on \u201cThe Five.\u201d She highly recommends the book and says it is an insightful and thought-provoking read. She recently sat down with Williams to talk with him about the book. DANA PERINO: Where would you rank women\u2019s movement in terms of disruption and impact on U.S. society? JUAN WILLIAMS: To me, the woman\u2019s movement is the most startling change of the last 230 years. Obviously the end of slavery and the demographic shifts in the American family have rocked the country. But stop and think about the women you know, the women I know and compare them to the women who were known to the Founding Fathers. My wife and mother-in-law both have Master\u2019s Degrees; my daughter and sister are both lawyers; one niece is a Yale Law school graduate who now prosecutes crimes in Washington, D.C.; another niece is a medical doctor; and my sister-in-law helped to run a winning state campaign to help elect President Obama. The positions that these women now occupy would have been impossible without Elizabeth Cady Stanton, early pioneer for women\u2019s rights who helped compose the 1848 Declaration of Sentiments. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to get so far if it weren\u2019t for Carrie Chapman Catt, who headed the fight for the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. And, in particular, it would be impossible without Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d got women to fight against their limited roles as housewives and mothers. It is the result of these and countless other pioneering women, who inspired women to go to work and marry later so that they could build careers first. It is the reason they fought for the right to control their own healt That has had a tremendous impact on family life, with fewer marriages taking place, more children born to single women and more poverty for those children. Women also now make up the majority of college and graduate school students, three members of the Supreme Court, 20 percent of the Senate and a record 87 members of the House. And it is the reason why women now make up almost half of the work force. It is the reason why it is so outdated to judge women by their appearance as opposed to their intellect and character. DP: On a whole, would you say that the Constitution has held up since the nation\u2019s founding? JW: I do \u2013 it is an incredible achievement for anything to last close to 230 years. When a framework for government can withstand civil war and world wars it stands as an incredible achievement. When you look past all the noise of politics, past the current presidential race and its 24-hour news coverage, you\u2019ll find a government that still operates by the guidelines set forth in the Constitution. You\u2019ll see a legislature that makes laws, a judiciary that interprets them, and a president that enforces them. You\u2019ll see separation of powers, checks and balances: a president that can veto a bill, but a Congress that can override the veto; a president that can lead the nation, but a Congress that can still impeach him; a president that can appoint a Supreme Court Justice, but a Congress that can turn down his appointment. So, even as we decry all the excesses and distraction of modern political culture, we need to remember that the building blocks of contemporary government \u2013 things we still do \u2013 are all written, right there, in the Constitution. Yet in some ways the Constitution has not stood the test of time. And that\u2019s a good thing. The men who wrote the Constitution would never have understood something like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the Voting Rights Act of the following year. In their day blacks were three-fifths of a person. They did not fight to end slavery. And they allowed the slave trade to continue for 20 more years. It was Thurgood Marshall who once called the Constitution \u201cdefective from the start.\u201d So, in part, it is a good thing that the Constitution included the ability to be amended. When the 55 delegates were gathered in 1787 to write the Constitution, they didn\u2019t make their debates open to the public. They wanted to be able to disagree candidly, without the fear that their words would be used against them. They wanted to disagree, which they did\u2014a whole lot \u2013 before reaching compromise. That was the spirit in which the Constitution was written. So, the fact that we\u2019re still fighting may prove just how constitutional America still is. DP: What is the next big change and who might lead it? JW: Option 1: As a black man, one of the most emotional parts of the book to write was the chapter on race. The rapid increase in racial minorities in the USA and immigrants is changing the national character. It is no longer solely focused on black disadvantage and white responsibility for slavery. The conversation is far more nuanced with the problems of racial inequity often focused on the black poor and their mistreatment by the police. But there is a bigger story about race emerging. In the book I focused on two figures \u2013 Martin Luther King and Jesse Jackson \u2013 who defined the race question of their era. For King in the mid-20th century, it was a question of black citizenship: earning the right to vote and enter white-owned establishments. For Jackson, in the late 20th century, it was a question of black capitalism: better jobs, better pay, and more\u00a0 political power to demand equity. But what issue defines the race question today? I think it comes down to education and ending the achievement gap between black and white students. Incidentally, it was while I was editing \u201cWe The People\u201d that Donald Trump called for a wall between the United States and Mexico and claimed Mexico was sending thugs, rapists, and drug dealers to the United States: inflammatory remarks that has made immigration reform a key talking point in the 2016 election season. I thought about my chapter on the Kennedy Brothers \u2013 John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy \u2013 whose Irish heritage inspired them to lobby for immigration reform, leading to the passage of the 1965 Hart-Celler Act. They did this by assuring Congress that immigration reform was in keeping with America\u2019s best principles: that we\u2019d always been a \u201cNation of Immigrants.\u201d Based on the amount of time politicians have spent on immigration during the election season, I think one major change -- fast approaching -- will involve immigration reform. It will come from someone who can find a way to provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently on our shore, while ensuring Republicans that the border will become secure. And it will come from someone who can convince America that immigration reform is in keeping with America\u2019s best principles of inclusivity. Perhaps it will be someone like Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force and longtime advocate for immigration reform who authored the Immigrant Children\u2019s Educational Advantage and Dropout Prevention Act in 2001 (never went to a vote), a precursor to the DREAM Act. Or maybe the current meltdown of the Right (caused by Cruz and Trump) will allow the moderate Republican voices on immigration to take control of the immigration question. Maybe it will be someone like Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a Republican of Cuban heritage and an important advocate for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. \u00a0Or maybe someone like Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a former member of the Gang of Eight who has also argued for a pathway to citizenship. DP: As a journalist, if you could go back, what would you have liked to ask the Founding Fathers? JW: Question for the Founders in General: How long do you think this republic will last? According to Yale historian Joanne Freeman, Americans well into the 1790s made offhand comments in their letters to one another like: \u201cIf this government lasts more than five years, here\u2019s what I think we should do.\u201d So I would ask them how much faith they had in the government that they were making. How long would it last? What would have to happen in order for it to last? Were they ever suspicious that it would fail as soon as it began? Who\u2019d be responsible for the failure? Some Questions for George Washington: Many believed that George would remain president until he died. But he did not. By stepping down from the presidency in 1796, Washington set the two-term precedent. He said he was tired and worn down by the job. His decision to turn down a third term has also been read in symbolic terms; the US is a democracy with presidents, not a monarchy with Kings. Mr. President, off the record, why didn\u2019t you take a third term? What were the competing interests? According to historian Ron Chernow you \u201chad always planned to remain as president only until the new Constitution had taken root.\u201d (Ron Chernow\u2019s words) But did you ever hesitate? Did the prospect of a third term ever seem appealing? Some questions for the loyalists: We tend to forget that not every colonist wanted to rebel against the mother country. But not every American Colonist was so set on starting a revolution. Some were loyalists. In fact, 15 to 20 percent of white male colonists during the Revolution remained loyal to the crown. Another large percent just didn\u2019t want anything to do with the war. Loyalists were not all stuffy aristocrats. Some were regular old farmers. I\u2019d want to talk to them. I\u2019d ask them what they thought about the patriots? What did they think about the Crown? What was their reasoning for not joining the cause? DP: All the changes that the US has been through can lead us to new beginnings. On the other hand, Trump is talking about returning to something that we\u2019ve lost. Is there some leader that can unite the people who want to go back and the people who want a new start? JW: That\u2019s a difficult question. But here are some ideas: Someone in the Tech Industry: So I didn\u2019t cover this in the book, but when I think about the companies you hear most about today, and when I think about millennials, I realize that it\u2019s all about tech. People like Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, Sergey Brin, cofounder of Google, Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, and Kevin Systrom, founder of Instagram. Everyone respects the work that these tech hotshots have done: no matter your political persuasion. They\u2019ve been able to tap into America\u2019s long history of capitalist innovation, as well move America into the future technologically, radically changing the way we communicate, hold campaigns, and run government. Some of them are huge philanthropists. Some, like Zuckerberg, have been active in, among other areas, education reform and disease research. I wonder whether any of these or other tech figures will enter politics in earnest.",

However, Chrissy Bartelme, former environmental affairs chair of the UWGB Student Government Association, said the school should politicize what it calls the \u201cgreen lives movement.\u201d \u201cThe name \u2018Green Lives Matter\u2019 should not push away students, but rather encourage them to learn about those impacted by environmental hazards,\u201d she told FoxNews.com in an email. \u201cThe class name should have no effect on what the students will learn.\u201d Taught mostly by instructors \u201cof color, women, and blue collar sectors of society,\u201d the course fulfills a general education requirement for incoming freshmen, who will learn about topics like \u201cmigrant farm worker pesticide exposure\u201d and \u201curban environmental harms.\u201d Although he disagrees with the \u201chighly questionable\u201d title, Fiene applauded the content of the course material for shedding light on perceived racism within environmental policies. Environmental consultant Tracy Thomas agreed, adding that \u201cgreen\u201d causes support the very goals of the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201c\u2019Black Lives Matter\u2019 and \u2018Green Lives Matter\u2019 share one common thread-contiguity,\u201d she told FoxNews.com, pointing to a historical tendency for blacks to live in worn and neglected environments. \u2018Green Lives Matter\u2019 isn\u2019t the only eccentrically named course offered at the school-university administrators encourage faculty to develop creative titles for mandatory freshmen seminars, according to Furlong. Freshmen can also choose to enroll in \u201cFood Politics,\u201d \u201cThe Science and History of Monsters\u201d and \u201cFrom Disney\u2019s Pocahontas to the NFL: Stereotypes and the Realities of the First Nations People.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures during a campaign rally at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in Eau Claire, Wis.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute. One of the strangest ironies of this strangest of campaigns is that, if America does elect its first woman president, it will be Donald Trump, not Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will have played the crucial role. As if to confirm the most fevered feminist images of predatory male sexuality, Trump has managed to offend some of the most loyal Republican women, from senators, to local organizers, to rank and file. He now lags about 20 points behind Clinton among women voters. But while the media have been celebrating Republican women who finally \u201cget it,\u201d they have been less vocal about a striking class and education divide that should be a familiar theme in this election. Yes, college-educated women are overwhelmingly for Clinton; but women without college degrees are sticking with the Republican nominee. They may be less enthusiastic than they were in 2012, when they overwhelmingly supported Mitt Romney, and they are far less gung-ho than the almost two-thirds of their male counterparts in the Trump camp. Still, while the polls vary widely, Trump runs as high as 27 points ahead among white women without a college degree, higher than Clinton\u2019s 23-point advantage among college-educated women. So why are less-educated white women willing to look past Trump\u2019s serial offenses? One preferred media explanation is that many of these women are evangelical Christians who remain wedded to traditional gender roles and feel anxious about women in powerful positions. \u201cWomen who want to be protected in the private sphere or need to be protected in the private sphere tend to emphasize the need to protect and privilege women\u2019s special capacities for nurturing,\u201d the feminist historian Stephanie Coontz said in an interview in Vox. The picture that emerges from on-the-ground reporting, including some of my own, clashes with this image of the timid Biblical \u201chelp meet.\u201d Consider the most memorable character in J.D. Vance\u2019s bestselling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\": his grandmother, Mawmaw, a woman at ease with a rifle. Mawmaw was so disgusted by her husband\u2019s drinking that she doused him with gasoline and tossed a lit match. For good reason, her grandson took her seriously when she threatened to run over a classmate whom she believed was having a bad influence on him. (Amazingly, both men avoided serious injury.) Yes, college-educated women are overwhelmingly for Clinton; but women without college degrees are sticking with the Republican nominee. Not that most of Trump\u2019s female supporters resemble Mawmaw. They work in insurance offices, hospitals, or schools, where they have to put on proper attire and say \u201cPardon me\u201d without thinking when they bump into someone. Still, away from work, they are familiar with rural life and the coarser manners that sometimes go along with it. Their husbands or uncles may drive a truck; maybe their brother-in-law is a fireman or a plumber, men who come home muddy, greasy, and smelling more like an oil spill than Valentino Uomo. In her recent book \"Strangers in Their Own Land,\" the sociologist Arlie Hochschild profiles a single, 60-year-old Lake Charles, Louisiana accountant, a Pentecostal with \u201ca direct, forceful manner.\u201d \u201cI learned to handle a shotgun when I was six, picking off cottonmouth and copperhead snakes,\u201d she tells Hochschild. \u201cMy daddy used to say if you shoot \u2018em, you clean \u2018em and eat \u2018em.\u201d Almost all these women have male relatives or friends in the military; some of those men are serving in very dangerous places. Their devotion to these men motivates some of their bitterness toward elites whose men don\u2019t have to worry about IEDs and midnight visits from the military police. Their fears for the men\u2019s safety also explain much of their contempt for Hillary Clinton, whose infamous question from the Benghazi hearings\u2014\u201cWhat difference at this point does it make?\u201d\u2014was the verbal equivalent of a cottonmouth bite. None of this means that Trump-supporting women approve of the candidate\u2019s wandering hands and foul mouth. But they take for granted a certain degree of bawdiness in relations between the sexes. \u201cWhen a group of women are together, we\u2019re talking just as nasty as the guys,\u201d a Trump-supporting teacher from Staten Island told me. \u201cWe\u2019re all guilty.\u201d At any rate, she continues, she doesn\u2019t get the gap between, on the one hand, empowered feminist talk\u2014the quasi-ironic embrace of terms like \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cnasty woman\u201d\u2014and the reluctance to say anything when they\u2019re mistreated by a man, on the other. (Or when they say they were mistreated; a lot of Trump women are extremely skeptical.) \u201cAll of these liberal women, I find it funny they\u2019re so outspoken fighting for women\u2019s rights and now they\u2019re afraid? It\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d Atlantic writer Molly Ball once asked Ivana Trump, Donald\u2019s first wife, whether it was \u201cpainful\u201d to be \u201ctreated like she was disposable, discarded abruptly after more than a decade of marriage for a younger woman?\u201d \u201cIvana harrumphed . . . \u2018I am Eastern European woman. I am strong.\u2019\u201d This language and worldview is a planet apart from our Trump-o-phobic media, professional, and political class, among whom I include myself. We were raised to \u201cuse our words\u201d not gasoline cans and pick-up trucks. We work with men who sweat primarily when they go to the gym. We intuitively sense the line between playfully suggestive and inappropriate, a word that has become oddly resurgent in this era of the bourgeois f-bomb. To understand this election, we should have spent much more time talking to women at ease with skinning a snake or having nightly dinner with a bone-tired man with calloused hands and few words. Had we done so, we might be less surprised by the results next Tuesday, whatever they might be.",

            "article_content": "In this April 21, 2016 photo, Stockton Mayor Anthony Silva participates in a mayoral candidate forum hosted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Stockton, Calif. (Clifford Oto/The Record via AP) A California mayor who has spent much of his adult career as a children\u2019s swim coach, school board president and leader for kids\u2019 camps was arrested Thursday on multiple charges, including contributing to the delinquency of a minor at his 2015 camp. Anthony Ray Silva, 40, mayor of Stockton since 2013, also was charged with \u201ceavesdropping or recording confidential communications, providing alcohol to a minor and cruelty to a child by endangering health.\u201d Silva did not return emails and calls from FoxNews.com. The mayor\u2019s attorney, Mark Reichel, called the timing of\u00a0 the arrest \u201chighly suspicious.\u201d He said the charges were politically motivated and timed so the mayor, who is up for re-election, \u201cwon\u2019t have enough time to clear his name before the election.\u201d But the investigation into Silva has been ongoing for nearly a year, and became public 10 months ago when Homeland Security agents detained the politician and seized his laptops and cell phone in the customs area of San Francisco\u2019s airport. A forensic investigation of his devices uncovered 23 photographs and four video clips recorded at an August 2015 Stockton Silver Lake Camp in Amador County, where Silva was operating a camp for economically disadvantaged children, according to Amador County DA Todd Riebe. The FBI turned over the investigation to his office in July 2016, and it moved quickly to charge Silva. In a statement to the press, Riebe said one of the video clips, which contained just audio, was an example of evidence that led to the charges. \u201cThat clip contains audio of a conversation between participants involved in a strip poker game that occurred in Silva\u2019s bedroom. The conversation between participants indicated they were naked,\u201d the DA wrote. \u201cOne of the participants was a 16-year-old male. The audio of the surreptitious recording clearly indicates that the participants did not want to be recorded.\u201d Witnesses also informed FBI agents that Silva provided alcohol to the participants, all of whom were underage, including a minor, Riebe said in the statement, as well as supplied alcohol and made it available to a number of underage counselors at camp. Another witness told investigators that Silva has cameras installed in his bedroom and at the Stockton Kid\u2019s Club, the DA added. In an exclusive interview in Oct. 2015 with FoxNews.com, Silva denied allegations that his electronic items were seized as a part of a criminal probe into child pornography related charges. He touted his affinity for children, noting he had served as the president for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Stockton for nearly a decade, served on the Stockton Unified District Board of Education from 2004 to 2008, and was appointed board president in 2006 and 2007.\u00a0He also served as a City of Stockton Parks & Recreation Commissioner and was a swim coach for teen girls and operated several camps for kids, Silva said. He also noted that he is a single father of a young son. On his LinkedIn social media page, Silva wrote, \u201cMayor Silva has a passion for helping\u00a0youth and, as a result, he sits on many local non-profit Board of Directors, including: Stockton Silver Lake Camp, Miss San Joaquin and the East Stockton Yellowjackets. Mayor Silva has made it a priority to reduce the crime and violence in the City.\u201d After he was detained last year by Homeland Security agents and had his electronics seized, Silva told FoxNews.com, \u201cI am confident that any forensic search of my personal devices will never ever show illegal or inappropriate activities of any sort.\u201d The controversial Republican, who has been the subject of previous law enforcement investigations,\u00a0had been attending the Silicon Valley Mayors Delegation China conference, along with 22 others, including chief executives from 14 Golden State cities and members of the business community, when he was stopped at the airport. Silva told FoxNews.com he was being racially profiled. \"As I was being searched at the airport, there was a Latino couple to my left, and an Asian couple to my right also being aggressively searched,\" he said. \"I briefly had to remind myself that this was not North Korea or Nazi Germany. This is the land of the free.\u201d First elected in 2012 to lead the city of 300,000, Silva has\u00a0weathered several previous damning accusations, including three criminal probes by school board police, local police and prosecutors in Stockton. \u201cI have never been charged with any crime. I\u2019ve never been convicted of any crime,\u201d Silva told\u00a0FoxNews.com last year. \u201cIn America, you are supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty.\u201d The Stockton Police Officers Association has called for his immediate resignation, according to a spokesman for the\u00a0organization.",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: The following is excerpted from \"The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe\" (Encounter Books, June 21, 2016). In the summer of 2014 a lie overtook significant parts of the country and grew into a kind of mass hysteria. That lie holds that the police pose a mortal threat to black Americans\u2014indeed, that the police are the greatest threat facing black Americans today. Several subsidiary untruths buttress that central myth: that the criminal-justice system is biased against blacks; that there is no such thing as a black underclass; and that crime rates are comparable between blacks and whites, so that disproportionate police action in minority neighborhoods cannot be explained without reference to racism. The poisonous effect of these lies manifested itself in the cold-blooded assassination of two NYPD officers in December that year. The highest reaches of American society promulgated those untruths and participated in the mass hysteria. President Barack Obama, speaking after a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, declared that blacks were right to believe that the criminal-justice system was often stacked against them. Obama repeated that message as he traveled around the country subsequently. Eric Holder escalated a long-running theme of his tenure as U.S. attorney general: that the police routinely engaged in racial profiling and needed federal intervention to police properly. University presidents rushed to show their fealty to the lie. Harvard\u2019s Drew Gilpin Faust announced that \u201cinjustice\u201d toward black lives \u201cstill thrives so many years after we hoped we could at last overcome the troubled legacy of race in America. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Harvard and .\u00a0.\u00a0. the nation have embraced [an] imperative to refuse silence, to reject injustice.\u201d Smith College\u2019s president abjectly flagellated herself for saying that \u201call lives matter,\u201d instead of the current mantra, \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d Her ignorant mistake, she confessed, drew attention away from \u201cinstitutional violence against Black people.\u201d The New York Times ratcheted up its already-stratospheric level of anti-cop polemics. In an editorial justifying the Ferguson riots\u00a0 the Times claimed that \u201cthe killing of young black men by police is a common feature of African-American life and a source of dread for black parents from coast to coast.\u201d In reality, however, police killings of blacks are an extremely rare feature of black life and a minute fraction of black homicide deaths. Blacks are killed by police at a lower rate than their threat to officers would predict. To cite more data on this point: in 2013, blacks made up 42 percent of all cop killers whose race was known, even though blacks are only about 13 percent of the nation\u2019s population. Less than one-third of all homicides by police involve black victims. Moreover, there is a huge, unacknowledged measure of support for the police in the inner city: \u201cThey\u2019re due respect because they put their lives every day on the line to protect and serve. I hope they don\u2019t back off from policing,\u201d a woman told me on the Staten Island street where Eric Garner was killed. (This was two nights before Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were assassinated in Brooklyn.) Among all the posturers, none was so preening as New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio. In advance of a trip to Washington for a White House summit on policing, he told the press that a \u201cscourge\u201d of killings by police was \u201cbased not just on decades, but centuries of racism.\u201d De Blasio embroidered on that theme several days later, after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an officer for homicide in Garner\u2019s death. (Recall that the 350-pound asthmatic Garner had resisted arrest for the crime of selling loose cigarettes; officers brought him to the ground, provoking a fatal heart attack.) \u201cPeople are saying: \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019\u201d de Blasio announced after the grand jury concluded. \u201cIt should be self-evident, but our history requires us to say \u2018black lives matter.\u2019 It was not years of racism that brought us to this day, or decades of racism, but centuries of racism.\u201d De Blasio added that he worries \u201cevery night\u201d about the \u201cdangers\u201d his biracial son, Dante, might face from \u201cofficers who are paid to protect him.\u201d The mayor\u2019s irresponsible rhetoric was a violation of his role as the city\u2019s leader and as its main exponent of the law. If he really believes that his son faces a significant risk from the police, he is ignorant of the realities of crime and policing in the city that he was elected to lead. There is no New York City institution more dedicated to the proposition that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d than the New York Police Department; thousands of black men are alive today who would have been killed years ago had data-driven policing not brought down the homicide levels of the early 1990s. The Garner death was a tragic aberration in a record of unparalleled restraint. The NYPD fatally shot eight individuals in 2013, six of them black, all posing a risk to the police, compared with scores of blacks killed by black civilians. But facts do not matter when one is crusading to bring justice to a city beset by \u201ccenturies of racism.\u201d New York police officers were rightly outraged at de Blasio\u2019s calumny. The head of the officers\u2019 union, Patrick Lynch, circulated a form allowing officers to request that the mayor not attend their funeral if they were killed in the line of duty\u2014an understandable reaction to de Blasio\u2019s insult. De Blasio responded primly on \"The View\": \u201cIt\u2019s divisive. It\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d The city\u2019s elites, from Cardinal Timothy Dolan on down, reprimanded the union. The New York police commissioner called the union letter \u201ca step too far.\u201d Meanwhile, protests and riots against the police were gathering force across the country, all of them steeped in anti-cop vitriol and the ubiquitous lie that \u201cblack lives\u201d don\u2019t \u201cmatter\u201d to the police. \u201cWhat do we want? Dead cops,\u201d chanted participants in a New York anti-cop protest. Two public defenders from the Bronx participated in a rap video extolling cop killings. Few people in positions of authority objected to this dangerous hatred. The desire to show allegiance with allegedly oppressed blacks was too great. The thrill of righteousness was palpable among the media as they lovingly chronicled every protest and among politicians and thought leaders who expressed solidarity with the cause. At another march across the Brooklyn Bridge, a group of people tried to throw trash cans onto the heads of officers on the level below them; police attempts to arrest the assailants were fought off by other marchers. The elite\u2019s desperation to participate in what they hopefully viewed as their own modern-day civil rights crusade was patent in the sanctification of Michael Brown, the would-be cop killer. He was turned into a civil rights martyr. His violence toward Wilson, and toward the convenience-store owner he had strong-armed, was wiped from the record. Protesters at anti-cop rallies across the country chanted \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d allegedly Brown\u2019s final words before Wilson shot him. Never mind that the source of that alleged final utterance, Brown\u2019s companion Dorian Johnson, was a proven liar. There is no reason to believe his claim regarding Brown\u2019s final words. Protesters\u2019 willingness to overlook anti-cop homicidal intent surfaced again in St. Louis in November. A teen criminal who had shot at the police was killed by an officer in self-defense; he, too, joined the roster of heroic black victims of police racism. This sanctification of would-be black cop killers would prove prophetic. It\u2019s profoundly irresponsible to stoke hatred of the police, especially when the fuel used for doing so is a set of lies. Hatred of the police among blacks stems in part from police brutality during this country\u2019s shameful era of Jim Crow laws and widespread discrimination. But it is na\u00efve not to recognize that criminal members of the black underclass despise the police because law enforcement interferes with their way of life. The elites are oblivious both to the extent of lawlessness in the black inner city and to its effect on attitudes toward the cops. Any expression of contempt for the police, in their view, must be a sincere expression of aggrievement. Cop killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who assassinated NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos on December 20, 2014, exemplified everything the elites have refused to recognize as the antipolice crusade marches on: he was a gun-toting criminal who was an eager consumer of the current frenzy of cop-hatred. (Not that he paid close enough attention to the actual details of alleged police malfeasance to spell Eric Garner\u2019s name correctly.) His homicidal postings on Instagram\u2014\u201cI\u2019m Putting Wings on Pigs Today. They Take 1 of Ours .\u00a0.\u00a0. Let\u2019s Take 2 of Theirs\u201d\u2014were indistinguishable from the hatred bouncing around the Internet and the protests that few bothered to condemn. That vitriol continued after the assassination. Social media filled up with gloating at the officers\u2019 deaths and praise for Brinsley: \u201cThat nigga that shot the cops is a legend,\u201d read a typical message. A student leader and a representative of the African and Afro-American Studies department at Brandeis University tweeted that she had \u201cno sympathy for the NYPD officers who were murdered today.\u201d The only good that could have come out of this wrenching attack on civilization would have been the delegitimation of the lie-based protest movement. That did not happen. The New York Times, instead, denounced as \u201cinflammatory\u201d the statement from the head of the officers\u2019 union that there was \u201cblood on the hands [that] starts on the steps of City Hall\u201d\u2014while the Times itself has promoted the inflammatory idea that police officers routinely kill blacks without cause. The elites\u2019 investment in black victimology was too great to hope for an injection of truth into the dangerously counterfactual discourse about race, crime, and policing.",

The preliminary numbers appear to show Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, with an edge in several of the roughly 10 battleground states that will decide the 2016 White House race. \u201cWe're seeing eye-popping vote-by-mail application numbers,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d In Arizona and North Carolina, for example, more registered Democrats than Republicans have indeed cast early ballots. But such numbers are open to interpretation, including how many Democrats in those two states voted for Clinton. Meanwhile, early data shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with potential advantages of his own in battleground states Florida, Ohio and elsewhere. Only some of the 37 states that allow early voting make public the number of registered Democrats and Republicans who requested early ballots and voted early, so final numbers won\u2019t be known until Election Day. Still, the Clinton campaign seemed bolstered in recent days by mail-in balloting in battleground Florida, where in-person voting started Monday in a majority of counties. Early Florida numbers showed about an equal number of Democrats and Republicans had requested a record 3.1 million early ballots, compared with 2008 when Republicans led 49-to-32 percent and President Obama still won the state. However, registered Republicans now have a slight lead -- 1.8 percentage points -- in the nearly 1 million ballots received by Friday. Trump, on a swing through Florida on Monday, made another push for supporters to cast their votes now. \u201cYou got to get out there. Who\u2019s voted already?\u201d Trump asked a cheering crowd in St. Augustine. \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well on Nov. 8, we don\u2019t want to take a chance.\u201d Clinton said in battleground North Carolina on Sunday: \u201cFrom now until Nov. 5, you can vote early. It\u2019s a big deal. You get to vote today, right after this event.\u201d Mook also pointed out Sunday that in Nevada, officials saw a \u201crecord turnout\u201d in Democratic stronghold Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. However, Trump has throughout the campaign appeared to have the support of some potential crossover voters, including Latino immigrants who back his tough message on illegal immigration. A recent CNN/ORC poll, for example, found 33 percent of registered Latino voters in Nevada support Trump, compared to 54 percent for Clinton. The Clinton campaign declined Monday to provide details on the states to which Mook and vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine referred Sunday. Kaine told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the campaign \u201clike(s) the early voting activity and the absentee-ballot requests coming in.\u201d Kendra Stewart, College of Charleston political science professor, said Monday that Kaine and Mook are \u201cdoing exactly what they should be doing by trying to use this as an opportunity to create enthusiasm within the party in the hopes of a bandwagon effect.\u201d However, she cautioned about the effort perhaps \u201cleaving some Democratic voters less motivated to vote if they feel like their candidate doesn\u2019t really need them\u201d and giving the Trump campaign the opportunity to use the underdog strategy to try to rally supporters to get out and vote. Elliott Fullmer, a Randolph-Macon College political science professor, suggested either camp could play up select early-vote trends. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a surprise for a campaign to think any positive momentum would play well,\u201d Fullmer said Monday. \u201cAnd the more they can discuss an advantage in early voting, they will.\u201d According to the University of Florida\u2019s U.S. Elections Project, roughly 6 million Americans have already cast early votes, which do not include absentee ballots. More than 46 million people are expected to vote before Election Day -- or as much as 40 percent of all votes cast. The District of Columbia also allows early voting. Included in the 37 states that allow early voting are Colorado, Oregon and Washington, which have only mail-in balloting. Clinton holds a 6 percentage point lead over Trump in national polls, according to the RealClearPolitcs average. Clinton -- who has been the frontrunner for the entire race -- also has leads in battlegrounds states New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Trump leads in battlegrounds Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and Ohio. Though neither Georgia nor Ohio break down early balloting by party affiliation, Trump appears to have an advantage in both states. In Ohio, such requests are down 10 percent among black voters, who in recent decades have tended to vote for Democrats. And requests among Ohio\u2019s increasing white population, a voting bloc in which Trump appears to do well, is up 3 percentage points, to 91 percent. In Georgia, ballot requests and returns among black voters trail 2012 levels. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kristin Fisher reports from Washington, D.C. The Donald Trump campaign on Sunday heaped more blame on the media, accusing news organizations of \u201crigging\u201d the election for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton but vowing to accept the Nov. 8 results -- win or lose. \"We will absolutely accept the results of the election,\" Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Pence made the comment amid two polls Sunday that showed Clinton with a solid lead and as he and Trump resumed their attack on the media -- after essentially nine straight days of headlines related to Trump\u2019s treatment of women over the past 30 years. \u201cThe American people will speak,\u201d Pence continued on NBC. \u201cBut (they) are tired of the obvious bias in the national media. That's where the sense of a rigged election goes here.\u201d Democratic vice-presidential nominee Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve said this would be a very close campaign.\u201d A Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Clinton with a 47-to-43 percent lead over Trump, essentially unchanged, compared the groups\u2019 earlier polls. And an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton with an 11 percentage point lead over Trump, her GOP rival, with 23 days before Election Day. \u201cThe media is piling on with unsubstantiated claims \u2026 while they ignore an avalanche of hard evidence about corruption, pay to play, political favoritism emanating out of Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state,\u201d Pence told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He cited the example of a hacked email recently released by WikiLeaks that shows that representatives from Qatar in 2012, while Clinton was secretary of state, apparently tried to get a quick meeting with Clinton\u2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton, to give him a $1 million check for the family foundation. Trump on Sunday continued his attack on the media via Twitter, after making his case in person Saturday at three campaign rallies. \"The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary -- but also at many polling places,\" Trump tweeted. Trump tweeted earlier in the day: \u201cWatched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!\" On Saturday, Trump, a first-time candidate and wealthy New York businessman, suggested that Clinton, during their debate earlier this month, appeared to be on drugs -- acting \u201cpumped up,\u201d then exhausted at the end. He suggested they each take a drug test before their third-and-final debate Wednesday and mocked Clinton for staying off the trail the entire weekend to prepare. Pence declined to elaborate on Trump\u2019s remark, saying to Fox News, \"All I know for sure is that Donald Trump is going to be ready for the debate.\u201d The stories about Trump mistreating women started with the Oct. 7 release of a 2005 audiotape in which Trump is heard bragging about his celebrity status allowing him to kiss and fondle women without their consent. Trump has apologies for the comments, and nine women have since come forward to say Trump acted inappropriately with them. Trump has denied the allegations, calling one woman a \u201cliar,\u201d while he and Pence work to find evidence to refute the allegations. The allegations appear to have overshadowed WikiLeaks' recent release of hacked emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Some showed the campaign worrying whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., might endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the party's primary, and wrestling with how to respond to revelations about Clinton's private email use. The emails also show aides lining up materials to respond to fresh accusations from a woman who accused Bill Clinton of raping her decades ago. The former president denied the accusation, which was never adjudicated by a criminal court. Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin on Saturday compared the Podesta email hack to the Watergate break in. \"Four decades later, we\u2019re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly this time, instead of filing cabinets, it\u2019s people\u2019s emails they\u2019re breaking into \u2026 and a foreign government is behind it.\" Top Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani appeared Sunday on TV to try to downplay Trump\u2019s renewed argument about potential voter fraud and the potential need for poll monitors -- particularly in big, Democratic-run cities like Philadelphia. \"When he talks about a rigged election, he's not talking about the fact that it's going to be rigged at the polls,\" the former New York City mayor said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWhat he's talking about is that 80 percent to 85 percent of the media is against him.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A man holds up a sign saying \"Black Lives Matter\" during a protest of shootings by police, at the White House in Washington, on July 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The column originally appeared in The Boston Globe. It is a real tragedy that Black Lives Matter \u2014 which has done so much good in raising awareness of police abuses \u2014 has now moved away from its central mission and has declared war against the nation state of the Jewish people. In a recently issued \u201cplatform,\u201d more than 60 groups that form the core of the Black Lives Matter movement went out of their way to single out one foreign nation to accuse of genocide and apartheid. No, it wasn\u2019t the Syrian government, which has killed tens of thousands of innocent people with barrel bombs, chemicals, and gas. Nor was it Saudi Arabia, which openly practices gender and religious apartheid. It wasn\u2019t Iran, which hangs gays and murders dissidents. It wasn\u2019t China, which has occupied Tibet for more than half a century. And it wasn\u2019t Turkey, which has imprisoned journalists, judges, and academics. Finally, it wasn\u2019t any of the many countries, such as Venezuela or Mexico, where police abuses against innocent people run rampant and largely unchecked. Nor was it the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, where the police are a law unto themselves who act as judge, jury and executioner of those whose politics or religious practices they disapprove. It was only Israel, the nation state of the Jewish people and the only democracy in the Middle East. The platform accuses the US of being \u201ccomplicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people\u201d by providing aid to \u201can apartheid state.\u201d To be sure, Black Lives Matter is not a monolithic organization. It is a movement comprising numerous groups. Many of its supporters have no idea what the platform says. They cannot be faulted for supporting the movement or its basic mission. But the platform is the closest thing to a formal declaration of principles by Black Lives Matter. The genocide paragraph may well have been injected by radicals who are not representative of the mainstream. But now that it has officially been published, all decent supporters of Black Lives Matter \u2014 and there are many \u2014 must demand its removal. Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitic. Like other democracies, including our own, it has faults. Criticizing Israel\u2019s settlement and occupation policies is fair game. But singling Israel out and falsely accusing it of \u201cgenocide\u201d can be explained in no other way than blatant hatred of Jews and their state. In defending its citizens against terrorism since before its establishment as a state in 1948, Israel has killed fewer Palestinians than did Jordan and Syria in two much shorter wars. The relatively low number of civilian deaths caused by Israeli self-defense measures over the past 68 years compares favorably to the number of civilian deaths in other conflicts. This is because, as Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, put it: There has been \u201cno time in the history of warfare when an Army has made more efforts to reduce civilian casualties...than [the Israel Defense Forces].\u201d Though Kemp was specifically referring to the wars in the Gaza Strip \u2014 which are also the apparent focus of the Black Lives Matter Platform \u2014 his conclusion is applicable to all wars Israel has fought. Genocide means the deliberate extermination of a race, such as done by Nazi Germany to Jews and Sinti and Roma or by the Hutu against the Tutsi in Rwanda. It has no application to deaths caused by self-defense measures taken to protect citizens against terrorism. To falsely accuse Israel of \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 the worst crime of all, and the crime whose very name was coined to describe the systematic murder of 6 million Jews \u2014 is anti-Semitic. Until and unless Black Lives Matter removes this blood libel from its platform and renounces it, no decent person \u2014 black, white, or of any other racial or ethnic background \u2014 should have anything to do with it. We should continue to fight against police abuses by supporting other organizations or forming new ones. But we must not become complicit in the promotion of anti-Semitism just because we agree with the rest of the Black Lives Matter program. To support an organization or movement that promotes anti-Semitism because it also supports good causes is the beginning of the road to accepting racism. Many racist groups have also promoted causes that deserve support. The Black Panthers had breakfast programs for inner-city children, while advocating violence against whites. And the Ku Klux Klan organized summer camps for working-class families, while advocating violence against blacks. There must be zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, regardless of the race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation of the bigots who promote, practice or are complicit with it. Being on the right side of one racial issue does not give one a license to be on the wrong side of the oldest bigotry. To give Black Lives Matter a pass on its anti-Jewish bigotry would be to engage in racism. Black anti-Semitism is as inexcusable as white anti-Semitism or white racism. There can be no double standard when it comes to bigotry. I write this column both in sorrow and in anger. In sorrow because I support the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 I have long been involved in efforts to expose and prevent police abuses \u2014 and worry that this obnoxious and divisionary platform plank may destroy its credibility with regard to police abuse in America by promoting deliberate lies about Israel. It is also alienating Jewish and other supporters who could help them achieve their goals here at home \u2014 as many such individuals have historically done in actively supporting all aspects of the civil rights movement. I write it in anger because there is never an excuse for bigotry and for promoting blood libels against the Jewish people and their state. It must stop. And those who engage in it must be called out for condemnation. Black Lives Matter should rescind the portions of the platform that falsely accuse Israel of genocide and apartheid. If it does not, it risks ending in the dustbin of history, along with other discredited bigoted groups. It would be sad if the good work done by Black Lives Matter were now to be sidetracked by the mendacious and irrelevant accusation of \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201capartheid\u201d against one foreign democracy \u2014 Israel.",

            "article_content": "This undated photo provided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice shows death row inmate Barney Fuller. (Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP)) HUNTSVILLE, Texas \u2013 An East Texas man who pleaded guilty to killing a neighbor couple during a shooting rampage 13 years ago and said he wanted to be put to death for the crime was executed Wednesday evening. Barney Fuller Jr., 58, has asked that all his appeals be dropped to expedite his death sentence. Fuller never made any eye contact with witnesses, who included the two children of the slain couple. Asked by Warden James Jones if he had any final statement, Fuller responded: \"I don't have anything to say. You can proceed on, Warden Jones.\" Fuller took a deep breath as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials injected a lethal dose of pentobarbital into each arm, then blurted out: \"Hey, you fixin' to put me to sleep.\" He took a couple of breaths, then began snoring. Within 30 seconds, all movement stopped. Fuller was pronounced dead 38 minutes later, at 7:01 p.m. CDT. The time between when the drug began and when he was pronounced was somewhat longer than normal. \"Each person is unique in how his body shuts down,\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said, explaining the extended time. Fuller became the seventh convicted killer executed this year in Texas and the first in six months in the nation's most active capital punishment state. Fuller surrendered peacefully at his home outside Lovelady, about 100 miles north of Houston, after a middle-of-the-night shooting frenzy in May 2003 that left his neighbors, Nathan Copeland, 43, and Copeland's wife, Annette, 39, dead inside their rural home. The couple's 14-year-old son survived two gunshot wounds, and their 10-year-old daughter escaped injury because Fuller couldn't turn the light on in her bedroom. Court records show Fuller, armed with a shotgun, a semi-automatic carbine and a pistol, fired 59 shots before barging into the Copeland home and opening fire again. Fuller had been charged with making a threatening phone call to Annette Copeland, and the neighbors had been engaged in a 2-year dispute over that. Fuller pleaded guilty to capital murder. He declined to appear in court at his July 2004 trial and asked that the trial's punishment phase go on without his presence. He only entered the courtroom when jurors returned with his sentence. Last year, Fuller asked that nothing be done to prolong his time on death row. \"I do not want to go on living in this hellhole,\" he wrote to attorney Jason Cassel. Fuller had no late change of heart, Cassel said Tuesday. A federal judge in June ruled Fuller competent to drop his appeals after he testified at a hearing that he was \"ready to move on.\" Fuller had irritated neighbors with his frequent gunfire and was summoned to court in 2003 to address a charge that he made a threatening phone call two years earlier after complaints he shot out an electrical transformer providing power to the Copelands' home. \"Happy New Year,\" he told Annette Copeland in the Jan. 1, 2001, call. \"I'm going to kill you.\" William House, one of Fuller's trial lawyers, said Fuller thought when he got a court notice \"that they were stirring up some more stuff and he just kind of twisted off.\" Court records showed he seethed over the court appearance and began drinking. Two nights later, he grabbed his guns and extra ammunition clips and went to the Copelands' home about 200 yards away. House described Fuller as \"just a strange bird\" who was \"very adamant\" about not attending his own murder trial. \"I think we did everything we were supposed to and did the best we could but didn't have a whole lot to work with,\" House said. A sheriff's department dispatcher who took Annette Copeland's 911 call about 1:30 a.m. on May 14, 2003, heard a man say: \"Party's over, bitch,\" followed by a popping sound. Annette Copeland was found with three bullet wounds to her head. Cindy Garner, the former Houston County district attorney who prosecuted Fuller, described him as mean and without remorse. \"It's not a cheerful situation,\" she said of the execution. \"I just regret that this little, plain, country, nice, sweet family \u2014 bless their heart \u2014 moved in next door.\" Fuller's execution was only the 16th in the U.S. this year, a downturn fueled by fewer death sentences overall, courts halting scheduled executions for additional reviews, and some death penalty states encountering difficulties obtaining drugs for lethal injections.",

            "article_content": "FILE -- July 5, 2016: President Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton walk down the steps of Air Force One after arriving at North Carolina Air National Guard Base in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) A failed state, a terrorist haven, four dead Americans \u2013 this is the Hillary Clinton record in Libya we know about. But new evidence -- and a review of the public record -- reveals that Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions in Libya were not just disastrous policy, but a violation of U.S. anti-terrorism law. A recent report to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons concluded that Western intervention in Libya was based on \"inaccurate intelligence\" and \"erroneous assumptions.\" Advocates failed to recognize that \u201cthe threat to civilians was overstated and that the rebels included a significant Islamist element,\" and the failure to plan for a post-Qaddafi Libya led to the \"growth of ISIL\" in North Africa. However, \u201cinaccurate intelligence\u201d doesn\u2019t fully describe the whole story. A closer examination of the run-up to the Libya debacle on September 11, 2012 leads to the irrefutable conclusion that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knowingly armed radical Islamist terrorists in Libya. False pretenses The American public was told that the intervention in Libya was necessary to prevent a humanitarian crisis. But just as Hillary Clinton would describe the attack on our Benghazi diplomats as a spontaneous protest over a video, the military intervention that led inexorably to the debacle in Benghazi was sold on false pretenses: to prevent an imminent massacre of civilians engaged in a pro-democracy uprising. Hillary Clinton described the 2011 Arab Spring rebellion in eastern Libya as a spontaneous pro-democracy uprising, but the Libyan connection to radical Islamic extremist groups was well known long before 2011. The region where the rebellion began was a fervid recruiting ground for jihadis who killed American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The leaders of the \u201ccivilian uprising\u201d that Hillary Clinton supported were members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) who had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. They refused to take orders from non-Islamist commanders and assassinated the then leader of the rebel army, Abdel Fattah Younes. The LIFG had been jailed under Qaddafi until hundreds of their members were released through a de-radicalization program. That program was spearheaded by an exiled Muslim Brotherhood affiliated Libyan cleric based in Qatar named Ali al-Sallabi. The jihadis pledged they would never use violence against Gaddafi again. But nearly as soon as the LIFG was released they took up arms against the Qaddafi regime. Just as there was ample evidence that Hillary\u2019s \u201cpro-democracy protestors\u201d were radical Islamists, there was no truth to the assertion a civilian massacre was imminent. Libyan doctors told United Nations investigators that, of the more than 200 corpses in Tripoli\u2019s morgues following fighting in late February 2011, only two were female. This indicates Qaddafi\u2019s forces targeted male combatants and did not indiscriminately attack civilians. Nor had Qaddafi forces attacked civilians after retaking towns from the rebels in early February 2011. While Muammar Qaddafi had a 40-year record of appalling human rights violations, his abuses did not include large-scale attacks on Libyan civilians. We restored full diplomatic relations with Qaddafi in 2007 and he was a key partner in counter-terrorism efforts. LIFG and affiliated jihadis received at least 18 shipments of arms from Qatar with the blessing of the U.S., the Wall Street Journal reports. The arms shipments were funneled through none other than Ali al-Sallabi, the Qatar cleric who brokered their release from prison. The Islamists were able to pay for the weapons because Clinton had convinced Obama to grant full diplomatic recognition to the rebels, against the advice of State Department lawyers and the Secretary of Defense. As the Washington Post reported, this move \u201callowed the Libyans access to billions of dollars from Qaddafi\u2019s frozen accounts.\u201d These arms shipments are significant for several reasons. It led to the indictment of American arms dealer Marc Turi who was charged with selling weapons to Islamist militants in Libya through Qatar. The charges were dropped this week after Turi threatened to reveal emails showing Clinton had approved the sales. Here\u2019s where it gets very sticky for Secretary Clinton. The rebel leaders were on the State Department\u2019s Foreign Terrorist Organization list. It is a direct violation of the law to provide material support for terrorist organizations under 18 U.S. Code 2339A & 2339B. Penalties for providing or attempting to provide material support to terrorism include imprisonment from 15 years to life. Nor is the Qatar connection insignificant. Qatar has donated anywhere from $1 to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, and emails reveal members of the Qatari royal family were privileged with back channel meetings with Secretary Clinton at the State Department. While whipping up support for the Libya military campaign, Clinton told Arab leaders, \u201cit\u2019s important to me personally,\u201d the Washington Post reported. Hillary Clinton\u2019s prosecution of foreign policy in Libya crossed several lines: she showed extremely bad judgment by ignoring military and intelligence officials, she let personal interests conflict with U.S. foreign policy and, most importantly, she may have broken the law -- again. Any one of these transgressions should disqualify her from holding any kind of leadership role in our government, let alone president of the United States. The last one qualifies Hillary Clinton for government housing, though not in the White House.",

The early predictions largely were based on the fact Republicans are having to defend 24 Senate seats, spreading the party thin on money and resources, with Democrats needing to win no more than five seats to retake control of the chamber. Democrats also had early targets on Ohio and Wisconsin. But they might have to settle for a split. Democratic challenger Russ Feingold, a former U.S. senator, poses a serious threat\u00a0to unseat incumbent Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, in a very close race with millions of outside dollars pouring in late. But in Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman is now leading by double-digits on his way to a second term against Democratic challenger Ted Strickland. Not all of the early predictions have come true, with a few wild card races emerging. In Florida, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio launched an unexpected re-election bid after a failed White House run, which is spoiling Democrats\u2019 hopes of competing for a Senate seat without having to face a GOP incumbent. Rubio now leads challenger Democratic Rep. Tim Murphy, whom Republicans tagged as a privileged young man with an inflated resume, as Washington Democrats move their money to more competitive races. And Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is facing the fight of his political life from an upstart Democrat with military experience who can assemble an AR-15 blindfolded. Blunt is being forced to defend his political insider status, having been elected to Congress in 1996. His race with Missouri\u00a0Secretary of State Jason Kander is deadlocked, despite Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump now leading Missouri by double digits. Murray, whose group on Wednesday showed the race tied at 45 percent, said Blunt\u2019s tepid, anybody-but-Hillary Clinton support for Trump \u201cjust isn\u2019t good enough for the true believers.\u201d A Blunt loss would be a double-barreled blow to the GOP, considering he is a member of Senate leadership. NEW HAMPSHIRE Democrats liked their odds against GOP incumbent Kelly Ayotte, considering she is a first-term senator trying to appeal to the state\u2019s notoriously independent electorate while staying loyal to her Washington Republican base and supporters like the National Rifle Association and the billionaire, libertarian-minded Koch Brothers. Trump has arguably been the X-factor in essentially every congressional race -- with the Senate race in New Hampshire perhaps the most glaring example. Ayotte, in her race with also-popular challenger Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, first said she\u2019d support Trump but did not endorse him. She then called Trump a \u201crole model,\u201d only to retract the statement after another offensive Trump comment, then totally withdrew her support. Ayotte and Hassan remain deadlocked at about 46 percent, with Trump trailing Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, in the state by about 5 percentage points. NEVADA With Sen. Harry Reid, the top Senate Democrat, retiring after five terms, Republicans considered a bid for his open seat perhaps their best 2016 opportunity to add to their now 54-seat majority. Republicans have a top-tier competitor in Rep. Joe Heck. But all the resources they\u2019ve put into the race for a parting shot at Reid cannot change the fact that Nevada is liberal-leaning and anchored by the Las Vegas area, home to a large Hispanic population, which\u00a0overwhelmingly supports Democratic candidates. The Democratic nominee is Catherine Cortez Masto. INDIANA Republicans also thought they\u2019d keep the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Dan Coats, with a solid candidate in three-term Rep. Todd Young. But former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh\u2019s surprise decision in July to enter the race -- with a $10 million war chest -- dampened GOP hopes. Still the race remains surprisingly close, within a couple of\u00a0percentage points, amid disclosures about Bayh\u2019s profitable connections to K Street and Wall Street. NORTH CAROLINA As is Missouri, Republicans didn\u2019t expect such a hyper-competitive race in North Carolina. Incumbent Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s challenger, Deborah Ross, is a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer and state representative, which gives her little state-wide name recognition. However, the national backlash from a Republican-backed bill that essentially requires transgender people to use the bathroom that matches their birth gender has unexpectedly put Burr on the defensive. The two-term senator is also running amid a federal appeals court ruling in July that struck down state voter ID laws that, according to the decision, suppressed voting among minorities. Such controversies have also turned North Carolina into an unexpected potential pickup for Clinton, though the state has voted for the Republican nominee in 10 of the past 12 presidential elections. Clinton and Trump have made dozens of campaigns stops in the battleground state in the closing weeks of the race. Meanwhile, Burr has created his own problems of late, having been recorded joking Saturday about a gun magazine not having a \u201cbullseye\u201d over a picture of Clinton\u2019s face. Burr promptly gave an apology in a race that remains a statistical tie in its final days. WISCONSIN Feingold is back for a rematch, after losing his Senate seat in 2010 to Johnson. Both candidates are running against historical odds: Not since 1934 has a U.S. senator won a rematch against the candidate who defeated him six year earlier. And the state has not elected a Republican senator in a presidential election cycle since 1980. Republicans quietly had low expectations about keeping the seat, with Johnson among those after the 2014 midterms to publicly express concern about 2016. \u201cThere's no doubt about it, it's going to be a bigger challenge,'' he said in December 2014, a few weeks after the GOP won control of the Senate. Trump has also loomed large in this race, in which Feingold leads by about 6 percentage points. In the 2016 GOP primaries, Trump dashed the presidential aspirations of Wisconsin\u00a0Gov. Scott Walker, popular within the state\u2019s conservative base. And Trump\u2019s controversial remarks eventually led House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., last month to stop campaigning for the nominee, though Ryan still plans to vote for Trump. Last week, the Democrats\u2019 Senate Majority PAC put $2 million into the race, which didn\u2019t seem to\u00a0shock political analysts. But they appeared to take notice Wednesday when Republican super PAC Senate Leadership Fund announced it would match the Democrats' investment and launched a new television ad attacking Feingold. \u201cThis is a game changer because it means that Republicans see a path to victory for Johnson,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report. PENNSYLVANIA Republican Sen. Pat Toomey was another early, prime target for Democrats. He\u2019s a first-term Republican senator seeking reelection in a presidential year in Pennsylvania, which has voted for the Democratic nominee in the past six elections, despite its battleground status. Washington Democrats\u2019 handpicked candidate is Katie McGinty, a former Clinton administration adviser and chief of staff for Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. But after a hard-fought primary that included former Rep. Joe Sestak, McGinty has run what some political analysts have called an uninspiring race. \u201cHillary Clinton is leading in Pennsylvania in some polls by double digits,\u201d political analyst Erin McPike recently told Fox News. \u201cBut it\u2019s looking like voters are willing to split the ticket. It looks like Hillary Clinton is not going to be able to pull Katie McGinty over the finish line.\u201d Said Murray: \u201cNeither Clinton nor Trump have good coattails.\u201d Toomey, a Republican who has backed Capitol Hill legislation on reforming firearms laws, has been endorsed by gun-control advocate former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the Americans for Responsible Solutions, a political action committee founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords. The race between the two Ivy League-educated candidates has already set a spending record -- more than $117 million from their committees and independent groups.",

In a phone interview Monday on \"Fox and Friends,\" the Republican presidential nominee said he would \"knock the hell out of\" terrorist groups. A weekend explosion in Manhattan injured 29 people. Trump said local police often know who \"a lot of these people are\" but \"they are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling.\" Trump also repeated his call to crack down on immigration, a central theme of his campaign. He said: \"This isn't just something that I developed overnight\" because of the attacks. \"I knew this was going to happen,\" he added. ___ 5:50 a.m. Hillary Clinton is wooing younger voters in Philadelphia as her campaign acknowledges they need to do more to get millennials on board. Campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri says Clinton will use the Monday morning event at Temple University to \"speak directly to millennial voters about how they have the most at stake in this election.\" She added that the campaign recognizes younger voters are a key demographic and \"it's clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote.\" Palmieri noted the campaign has increased efforts to reach out to young voters. They are sending out popular surrogates like President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. She says the campaign is also working in the states to organize and mobilize younger voters.",

(Matt Bell/The Register &amp; Bee via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT (The Associated Press) SMYRNA, Tenn. \u2013 A Blue Angels pilot who died when his F/A-18 fighter jet crashed near Nashville, Tennessee, had wanted to fly since he was a child, relatives said. A U.S. official identified the pilot killed Thursday as Marine Capt. Jeff Kuss. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"It's hard to put into words right now, but it's beautiful that a person can live and die engaged in their life's pursuits,\" said his grandfather, Dolph Kuss, reached at his home in Durango, Colorado. \"This was his dream since he was a child, to be an aviator, a flier.\" He choked back tears and said he was struggling to gather his thoughts. \"It's hard to celebrate someone's life in this way,\" he said. \"It is certainly a shock. Everything in life has its dangers, I guess.\" Kuss was married with two young children, his grandfather said. It was the second fighter jet crash of the day for the military's elite fighter jet performance teams. A member of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds crashed in Colorado after a flyover for the Air Force Academy graduation where President Barack Obama spoke. That pilot ejected safely into a field. Harry Gill, the town manager in Smyrna just outside Nashville, said Thursday that the Blue Angels pilot was the only casualty and no civilians on the ground were hurt. The Navy said in a news release that the pilot was beginning to take off during an afternoon practice session for a weekend air show performance when the crash happened. Five other F/A-18 jets landed safely moments after the crash. \"My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the Blue Angels after this tragic loss. I know that the Navy and Marine Corps Team is with me. We will investigate this accident fully and do all we can to prevent similar incidents in the future,\" Adm. John Richardson, the Navy's top officer, said in a Facebook post. The team is based at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. According to his official Blue Angels biography, Kuss joined the elite aerobatics team in 2014 and accumulated more than 1,400 flight hours. He was a native of Durango and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marines in 2006. He had previously served in Afghanistan before joining the Blue Angels. Kuss' hometown newspaper, The Durango Herald, reported when Kuss was named to the Blue Angels team that he was a 2002 Durango High School graduate and 2006 graduate of Fort Lewis College, where he studied economics. The newspaper said he had been \"enamored of jets since he was a toddler,\" learned to fly in Durango and soloed in a Cessna 152 when he was 15. \"He still hadn't gotten a driver's license,\" his mother, Janet Kuss, told the newspaper then. \"His favorite toys were jets, and he wanted to be a Blue Angel since forever.\" In a video the U.S. Navy posted to its YouTube channel, Kuss stood in his flight suit in front of a line of Blue Angels planes and answered a question from a fan about how to become a pilot. \"I started flying when I was a young kid,\" he said. \"I always had a love for it, worked really hard through school, went to college and eventually got into the military. I wanted to fly the fastest, meanest thing I could. And that's why I'm here today, because I was fortunate enough to get to fly the F-18 Hornet. It's been a great experience every time I strap into it.\" The Blue Angels will not participate, but the Great Tennessee Air Show will go on as scheduled, Smyrna airport Executive Director John Black said in a news release. \"After close consultation with the Blue Angels, regulatory officials and the performers, we have made the decision to carry on with this weekend's show,\" Black said. Thomas Bucher, 32, of Smyrna, lives about 2,000 feet from the crash site and was outside doing yard work Thursday afternoon. He had noticed the jets practicing near the airport. \"That particular Blue Angel, I saw him doing some barrel rolls looked like in the air,\" he said \"He was flying awful low, I thought, and he kind of got below the tree line over there. And it looked like he was on his belly going down, and that's the end of it.\" After the plane went below the tree line, Bucher said he saw a cloud of smoke come up over the tree line. \"I was hoping that he had ejected from his seat, but with him being that low ... My dad is in aviation; I knew there was no way he could have ejected from that height and survived.\" ___ Baldor reported from Washington.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate has vowed to continue fight until convention While Hillary Clinton moved to the brink of clinching the Democratic presidential nomination with weekend wins in Caribbean contests \u2013 and could pass the milestone with a victory Tuesday evening in New Jersey \u2013 polls show Bernie Sanders still could deliver a symbolic wound by taking the Democratic stronghold of California. Several recent polls have shown the Vermont senator closing Clinton\u2019s lead in California and bringing the race into toss-up territory. The latest, from CBS News, showed Clinton up just 2 points over Sanders, 49-47 percent. The same poll gave Clinton a comfortable double-digit lead in New Jersey, which is voting Tuesday alongside California and four other states in the last major primary day of the year. Thanks to strong victories for the Democratic front-runner over the weekend in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, she is now in striking distance of the nomination -- 26 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to win, according to an Associated Press count. New Jersey could put her over the top Tuesday evening, before California even wraps up. But an after-the-fact victory for Sanders in the Golden State would nevertheless be a blow to Clinton, who is trying to not only clinch the nomination but unify the party and nudge Sanders out of the race for good. A California win could energize Sanders and his supporters and encourage him to follow through on vows to take his fight all the way to the convention. In a sign of what\u2019s at stake, both candidates were barnstorming California ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections. As the Puerto Rico race was called, Clinton was on stage in Sacramento, rallying voters in California. Clinton captured at least 33 of the 60 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico. Sanders garnered at least 20, with seven outstanding. Clinton has 1,809 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses; Sanders has 1,520. When including superdelegates, her lead over Sanders is substantial -- 2,357 to 1,566. The former New York senator and secretary of state is all but certain to secure the Democratic nomination Tuesday, when six states hold primaries in which a total of 694 delegates are available. Like Clinton, Sanders made little mention of the outcome in Puerto Rico's primary. He said during an evening rally in San Diego that Democratic leaders should take notice that the \"energy and grassroots activism\" that will be crucial to the party in the fall \"is with us, not Hillary Clinton.\" He pointed to polls showing him faring better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Trump and his strength among Democratic voters under the age of 45. \"If the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House but regain the Senate and win governors' chairs all across this country, we are that campaign,\" he said. While those watching the results in Puerto Rico focused on their impact on the race for the Democratic nomination, the focus of many voters on the island was its ongoing economic crisis. Both Sanders and Clinton had pledged to help as the island's government tries to restructure $70 billion worth of public debt the governor has said is unpayable. Two weeks before the primary, Sanders criticized a rescue deal negotiated by U.S. House leaders and the Obama administration as having colonial overtones. In a letter to fellow Senate Democrats, Sanders said the House bill to create a federal control board and allow some restructuring of the territory's $70 billion debt would make \"a terrible situation even worse.\" He later promised to introduce his own legislation to help the island. Campaigning on the island last month, Sanders promised to fight against \"vulture funds\" on Wall Street that he said would profit off the fiscal crisis. \"That bill is anti-democratic and it's not in the best interest of Puerto Rico,\" said Jorge Gaskins, a 67-year-old farmer who supports Sanders and opposes a control board. Clinton has said she has serious concerns about the board's powers, but believes the legislation should move forward, or \"too many Puerto Ricans will continue to suffer.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "BALTIMORE \u2013 Seven months after Baltimore erupted in riots over the death of Freddie Gray, the first of six police officers charged in the case went on trial Wednesday, with a prosecutor saying the patrolman could have saved Gray's life simply by pushing a button on his uniform to call for a medic. Officer William Porter wasn't involved in Gray's initial arrest in April, but he was present at five of six stops that a police transport van made during a 45-minute ride after Gray was taken into custody, prosecutors said. At one point, Porter asked Gray if he needed a medic, and Gray replied that he could not breathe and could not move from the floor of the van, where he had been placed head-first, in plastic handcuffs and leg shackles. Instead of calling a medic, prosecutors say Porter picked Gray up from the floor and placed him in an upright position on the bench, and did not secure him in a seatbelt. \"The defendant alone is on trial for what he did, or more importantly, what he did not do,\" prosecutor Michael Schatzow said during opening statements. Gray's death triggered protests and rioting in the city, and helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. The troubles forced an incumbent mayor in the throes of a re-election campaign to drop out of the race, and toppled the career of a reform-minded police chief. The Baltimore homicide rate skyrocketed at a pace unseen in decades. Porter, who is also black, faces charges of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. The charges carry maximum prison terms totaling about 25 years. His attorneys were to present their opening statement later Wednesday. According to a pretrial filing, Porter told investigators that arresting Gray \"was always a big scene\" and indicated that he knew of a previous arrest in which Gray allegedly tried to kick out the windows of a police vehicle. \"You know, so he was always, always, like, banging around,\" Porter said in the filing. Porter will likely take the stand in his own defense. Gray, 25, died April 19 of a severe spinal injury he suffered while riding in the back of police van without a seatbelt, a violation of department policy. Gray arrived at a police station unresponsive, was taken to a hospital and died a week later. Prosecutors said Gray's spinal injury occurred in a section of the spinal cord where the nerves control the chest and the diaphragm. Such an injury would have impacted Gray's ability to breathe, Schatzow said. \"He had a duty to keep safe persons in custody,\" Schatzow said of Porter. \"Evidence will show this defendant criminally neglected that duty.\" A jury was seated earlier Wednesday in a selection process that was relatively brisk, given defense assertions in pretrial proceedings that it would be impossible to seat an impartial panel. Judge Barry Williams repeatedly denied defense motions to move the trial out of Baltimore. Williams questioned 150 jurors over two days, mostly out of public view, in an efficient process designed to shield their identities. Some were dismissed, leaving a smaller pool for the final selection of 12 -- eight women and four men -- and four alternates. Prospective juror Franz Schneiderman said he was interviewed individually by the judge after he indicated that he had been accused in or the victim of a crime. He told the judge he had some \"unfortunate\" experiences with Baltimore police, but believed he would be able to render a fair verdict. He was still dismissed. For several days after Gray died, the demonstrations were mostly peaceful. But on the day he was buried, looting and rioting started, and businesses were burned down. The unrest caused at least $33 million in property damage and police overtime. A verdict will likely to set the tone for the city. Many fear that an acquittal could prompt more protests and unrest or that a conviction could send shock waves through the city's troubled police department. Two other officers are black and the three additional officers are white. They will be tried separately beginning in January and lasting through the spring. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was harshly criticized in the wake of the civil unrest and her decision to enact and maintain a city-wide curfew aggravated protesters. In August, she announced that she would not seek re-election. But no reputations hinge on the trial's outcome as much as state's attorney Marilyn Mosby and her husband, Nick Mosby, a councilman for Baltimore's west side who announced his mayoral candidacy shortly after Rawlings-Blake pulled out. Marilyn Mosby, who took office in January, announced charges against the officers in May, using language that led defense attorneys to argue that she was so biased she should recuse herself from the case. She was in the courtroom for opening statements.",

            "article_content": "Philomath High School is shown Monday, Aug. 29, 2016, in Philomath, Ore. (Anibal Ortiz/The Gazette Times via AP) PORTLAND, Ore.  \u2013 A volunteer football coach and six players for a small town Oregon high school team face criminal charges for a hazing initiation in which 11 freshmen at a summer training camp had intimate parts of their bodies \"aggressively targeted,\" a prosecutor said Tuesday. The Philomath High School volunteer coach, Cooper Kikuta, has been charged with misdemeanor criminal mistreatment, punishable by up to a year in jail, and the players who allegedly hazed the freshmen are accused of juvenile crimes similar to adult charges of misdemeanor harassment and assault, said Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson. Haroldson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press that sexual abuse charges were not filed because he \"didn't see any evidence in the case to indicate that the touching was done for purposes of sexual arousal, but rather it was done in a hazing context.\" The alleged hazing happened during the football team's July trip to Camp Rilea on Oregon's northern coast, Haroldson said. The players were targeted \"as a form of initiation\" and one of the alleged victims was grabbed and held down twice, said Haroldson, the Corvallis Gazette-Times reported. Kikuta, 22, previously played on the Philomath team. \"The basis of the charge is that he withheld care for the kids that he was supervising,\" Haroldson said Tuesday. \"This occurred in his presence.\" Public records show Kikuta lives in Corvallis, home to Oregon State University. He does not have a listed phone number and did not immediately reply to a Facebook message seeking comment. Kikuta does not have a criminal record in Oregon, according to state records. Haroldson did not immediately respond to a telephone message inquiring if Kikuta has a lawyer who could comment on his behalf. Philomath, population about 4,500, was a timber town for generations but has undergone a transformation as the lumber industry declined and was the subject of the 2006 documentary \"Clear Cut: The Story of Philomath, Oregon\" about the clash of cultures hitting the community amid an economic transition driven by technology. Haroldson declined comment on who reported the hazing and would not say whether authorities believe it was an annual initiation ritual for the team. The intimate areas of the victims that were touched included their genitals and anuses. \"One of the critical points here is ensuring that we're not continuing to have hazing in this football program,\" Haroldson said in the newspaper's report. \"It ends now.\" The announcement of charges followed weeks of uncertainty about the team after Philomath school officials canceled the first three games, citing an investigation into unspecified football camp misconduct. The fourth game of the season is scheduled for Sept. 23 but officials are still \"continuing to assess if, or when, the varsity team will begin competing,\" Superintendent Melissa Goff said in statement. She said families of students identified as possible victims were given information about mental health providers and coaches are being required to take new training on prevention of bullying, harassment, and hazing. Teachers and staff members will take child sexual abuse prevention training in September, she added. \"We take hazing and bullying issues very seriously, and we have no tolerance whatsoever for the type of allegations raised in this investigation,\" Goff said.",

            "article_content": "Reaction from the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics In the cornucopia of pro-Clinton polling that preceded the 2016 presidential election, two polls stood out as outliers: the USC/LA Times tracking poll and the Investor's Business Daily/TIPP tracking poll. Both polls attempted to measure the national popular vote, but wound up capturing the scale of Donald Trump's victory in the Electoral College. \"As far as I was concerned, I was anticipating a Trump win,\" said\u00a0Raghavan Mayur, President of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts the IBD/TIPP poll. The final poll, released on Election Day, showed Trump with a two-percentage point lead over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Mayur compared Tuesday's election to 2004, when enthusiasm among Republicans helped George W. Bush get re-elected president despite exit polls favoring then-Sen. John Kerry. He also saw \"very robust enthusiasm\" for Trump among independents, which canceled out the registration advantage held by Democrats. \"Since Sept. 1, the number of Republicans [in the poll sample] was much higher than the number of Democrats,\" Mayur said. \"It was a new phenomenon in the data [and] I was not sure what is happening here.\" \"Day after day, I was weighing down Republicans until the final four or five days [of the race],\" Mayur continued. \"What I am seeing is ... a good amount of enthusiasm ... so I was going to predict who would show up.\" \"Polling is as much an art as science,\" said IBD Commentary Editor Terry Jones. \"It requires judgement ... [Mayur] sort of sensed this move and our polling responded to great enthusiasm. \"If you turn [voters] out, you'll get them enthused, and last night we saw that.\" The USC/LA Times tracking poll, notable for interviewing the same 3,200 respondents over a period of several months, gave Trump a 3.2-percentage point lead the day before the election. Since it premiered in early July, the poll results were about six percentage points more favorable to the real estate mogul than the national average. \"To be honest, I was surprised,\" University of Southern California economist Arie Kapteyn, who developed the poll, told the Los Angeles Times. \"I thought Clinton would win. But that shouldn\u2019t change the numbers.\" The poll surveyed voters on their likelihood, on a scale of 0-100, of supporting a certain candidate, as well as their likelihood of actually going to the polls. That helped Kapteyn and colleague Jill Darling detect white voters who sat out the 2012 election, but broke for Trump on Election Day. The pollsters' decision to weigh the sample based on voters' self-reported 2012 choices raised eyebrows and skewed the results toward Trump, according to former U.S. Treasury economist Ernie Tedeschi. The problem, according to Tedeschi, is that many people will incorrectly claim to have voted for Obama in 2012, when they actually voted for Romney or another candidate. On Election Day, Tedeschi ran his own version of the poll that gave more weight to census factors, such as marital status. The result showed Clinton leading the popular vote by just under 2 points, closer to the likely final outcome of the election. REVISED: Census-reweighted LAT/USC, Nov 8: Clinton +1.9https://t.co/NgjGMaBkfU pic.twitter.com/wXLxK3XZU4 \"It was an exercise to try to figure out what made the poll an outlier,\" Tedeschi said. \"I actually like the poll [method] a lot. \"If they had looked around and thought 'Boy, we're really out of line' and changed it,\" he added. \"That is in and of itself a form of bias.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, in Kinston, N.C. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) WASHINGTON \u2013 Some Republicans who were for Donald Trump before they were against him are now promising to vote for the GOP presidential nominee. Dozens of Republicans repudiated Trump after he was caught on videotape making crude, predatory comments about grabbing women. Endorsements were withdrawn and many lawmakers called for the nominee to drop out of the presidential race. Weeks later, several Republicans are back on the Trump train, while others in tough races won't say whether they're voting for their party's standard-bearer. Several Republicans have tied themselves into rhetorical knots in trying to support the White House candidate \u2014 or back away from him. TRUMP CITES VOTER REGISTRATION PROBLEMS TO BACK UP 'RIGGED' CHARGE Consider Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. He was one of the first to denounce Trump, saying hours after the 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" videotape was made public on Oct. 7 that the Republican candidate's \"abhorrent\" comments meant Chaffetz could \"no longer in good conscience endorse\" him. Now Chaffetz has reversed course, saying on Twitter this week that while he won't defend or endorse Trump, \"I am voting for him.\" Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, \"is bad for the USA,\" Chaffetz said. Chaffetz chairs the House Oversight Committee and has vowed to continue investigations into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, should Republicans hold their majority in the House. Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Mike Crapo of Idaho also have reversed course on Trump. Both called for the GOP nominee to step down in the wake of his videotaped comments, but both now say they will vote for him. TRUMP BUSINESS EMPIRE FACES CHALLENGES AS 2016 RACE NEARS END Trump \"has a lot of work to do, I think, to win this election. But I'm certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton,\" Thune said. Crapo also expressed disdain for Clinton and confirmed he \"will vote for the Republican ticket,\" Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice presidential nominee. Nevada Rep. Joe Heck and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey won't say how they're voting. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey (AP) Heck, who is locked in a close race with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the race to succeed retiring Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, refuses to say who he will vote for in the presidential race, calling it \"a personal decision.\" His vote \"is a secret ballot just like your ballot is a secret ballot,\" Heck told reporters. TRUMP HITS CLINTON OVER PUTIN CRITICISM: 'I DON'T THINK THAT'S SMART' Toomey, trying to ward off a strong challenge from Democrat Katie McGinty, has refused to endorse Trump but has not denounced him either. In an unusual campaign pitch to moderate voters, Toomey has launched a TV ad in Philadelphia that recounts praise from Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, while at the time airing ads that criticize Clinton in other parts of the state. Kaine said at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania that Toomey is trying to \"straddle with respect to Donald Trump,\" adding: \"I think Donald Trump poses a clear enough challenge that people ought to be able to go on the record and say what they think about him.\" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., has done verbal contortions as she struggles to distance herself from Trump while not alienating his most fervent supporters. For much of the year, Ayotte said she supported the nominee but would not endorse. At a recent debate with her rival, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, Ayotte called Trump a role model for children, then said she misspoke. Ayotte withdrew her support from Trump after the videotape was made public, and said she'd write-in vice presidential nominee Pence instead. But in a radio interview this week, Ayotte agreed with a host who said that if Trump is elected president, \"he's going to need some people in the Senate who can actually make some of the changes he's talking about.\" Ayotte responded, \"That's right.\" Hassan has said Ayotte waited too long to denounce Trump and that the senator's previous support showed a \"concerning lack of judgment.\" Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, also has been all over the map regarding Trump. Stewart said Thursday he'll vote for Trump, despite denouncing him previously for his vulgar comments about women. Stewart said in a video statement that a vote for a third-party candidate is the same as voting for Clinton. The new comments mark the latest shift by Stewart, who called Trump \"our Mussolini\" earlier this year, but then signed a letter put out by the Utah Republican Party in August supporting Trump. Stewart called on Trump to step aside after the 2005 tape was made public earlier this month.",

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Washington, D.C. Newly released emails appear to show a State Department official coordinating with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign before her use of a private email to conduct government business was revealed. Emails from campaign chairman John Podesta show that the state official provided Clinton aides with the agency\u2019s official response to a New York Times reporter in advance of the paper\u2019s March 2015 report that Clinton had used a private email account to conduct business while serving as secretary of state. WikiLeaks released the hacked emails Wednesday in part of a massive trove of emails disclosed by the whistleblowing website. The site has released new Podesta emails on a daily basis since October. WikiLeaks has indicated it intends to leak emails stolen from Podesta's account every day through the election. In a March 1, 2015 email, State Department press aide Lauren Hickey told Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill and two other advisers that then-State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki had \"just cleared\" a reply to the Times. Hickey provided the agency's response to the Clinton aides and also appeared to agree to a change requested by the campaign, saying: \"Yes on your point re records - done below.\" It is not clear what specific change was requested and made. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that the department would not comment on alleged leaked documents. But he said the department's effort to \"provide accurate information to the media\" about Clinton's tenure at the agency has \"at times required communicating with her representatives to ensure accuracy.\" The Clinton campaign has repeatedly warned that WikiLeaks has exploited emails stolen by hackers who may be working for the Russian government. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denied those claims in an interview with Russia Today on Wednesday. \u201cThe Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything,\u201d Assange said. \u201cHillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That\u2019s false \u2013 we can say that the Russian government is not the source.\u201d The Podesta emails follow a string of notable illicit caches released during the 2016 election campaign, including thousands of messages stolen from the Democratic National Committee and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. The FBI has opened a criminal investigation into the DNC thefts, but U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed the Russian government. In a hacked email chain from March 17, 2015, Clinton's campaign advisers discussed how to respond to a request by a Times reporter for comment on an upcoming story about how top State Department aides used private email accounts to communicate with Clinton. Clinton aide Philippe Reines wrote: \"There's a lot to respond to here, but first and foremost the premise is wrong. There is nothing wrong with anyone having personal email addresses or her emailing someone's private account or vice versa. Maybe she was wishing (longtime aide) Jake (Sullivan) a happy birthday. Or I was sending her a note about her mom. ... We're allowed to have personal lives.\" Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri wrote: \"Strikes me as a big problem that the NYT is having selected emails leaked to them and I think we should do a call to discuss the proper way to handle.\" The email exchange occurred about a month before Clinton officially launched her presidential bid in a video released in April 2015. In an August 2015 email exchange, Clinton aide Huma Abedin points out that Clinton wasn't prepared for all of the questions surrounding the use of her private email and asks for a longer list of questions and answers \"so at least it's out there and maybe she won't have to do it verbally again?\" Separately, a Justice Department official with close ties to Podesta sent him a \u201cheads up\u201d last year to warn might question witnesses about the presidential candidate's private emails. Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, the official now in charge of informing Congress about the revived Clinton email probe, gave a personal status update to the Clinton campaign in the email sent May 19, 2015. The message from his Gmail account to Podesta was titled: \u201cHeads up.\u201d \u201cThere is a [House Judiciary Committee] oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify,\u201d Kadzik wrote. \u201cLikely to get questions on State Department emails.\u201d The warning came just two weeks after Kadzik\u2019s son had written to Podesta asking for a job on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin told Fox News that Kadzik's son did not ever work for the campaign. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Marc Turi says Clinton State Department used him as fall guy; Catherine Herridge reports for 'Special Report' EXCLUSIVE: American arms dealer Marc Turi, in his first television interview since criminal charges against him were dropped, told Fox News that the Obama administration -- with the cooperation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department -- tried and failed to make him the scapegoat for a 2011 covert weapons program to arm Libyan rebels that spun out of control. \u201cI would say, 100 percent, I was victimized\u2026to somehow discredit me, to throw me under the bus, to do whatever it took to protect their next presidential candidate,\u201d he told Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge. The 48-year-old Arizona resident has been at the epicenter of a failed federal investigation led by the Justice Department spanning five years and costing the government an estimated $10 million or more, Turi says. Turi says the Justice Department abruptly dropped the case to avoid public disclosure of the weapons program, that was designed to force the ouster of Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi during the 2011 Arab Spring. \"Those transcripts from current as well as former CIA officers were classified,\" Turi said of the evidence. \"If any of these relationships [had] been revealed it would have opened up a can of worms. There wouldn't have been any good answer for the U.S. government especially in this election year.\" The Justice Department faced a deadline last week to produce records to the defense. Turi says he was specifically \u201ctargeted by the Obama administration \u201cand \u201clost everything--my family, my friends, my business, my reputation.\u201d As Fox News has reported extensively, in 2011, the Obama administration with support from some Republican and Democratic lawmakers explored options to arm the so-called \u201cLibyan rebels\u201d during the chaotic Arab Spring but United Nations sanctions prohibited direct sales. Turi's plan was to have the U.S. government supply conventional weapons to the Gulf nations Qatar and UAE, which would then in turn supply them to Libya. But Turi says he never sold any weapons, and he was cut out of the plan. \u00a0Working with CIA, Turi said Clinton's State Department had the lead and used its own people, with weapons flowing to Libya and Syria. \"Some (weapons) may have went out under control that we had with our personnel over there and the others went to these militia. That's how they lost control over it,\" Turi said. \"I can assure you that these operations did take place and those weapons did go in different directions.\" Asked by Fox News who got the weapons -- Al Qaeda, Ansar al-Sharia, or ISIS -- Turi said: \"All of them, all of them, all of them.\" Turi exchanged emails in 2011 with then U.S. envoy to the Libyan opposition Chris Stevens. A day after the exchange about Turi's State Department application to sell weapons, Clinton wrote on April 8, 2011 to aide Jake Sullivan, \"fyi. the idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered.\" Asked if the email exchanges are connected or a coincidence, Turi said, \"When you look at this timeline, none of it was a coincidence. It was all strategically managed and it had to come from her own internal circle.\" Turi also told Fox News that he believes emails sent about the weapons programs were deleted by Hillary Clinton and her team because that \u201cit would have gone to an organization within the Bureau of Political Military affairs within the State Department known as PM/RSAT (Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers.) \u00a0That\u2019s where you would find Jake Sullivan, Andrew Shapiro and a number of political operatives that would have been intimately involved with this foreign policy.\" The four felony counts -- which included two of arms dealing in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and two of lying on his State Department weapons application -- were dismissed last week against Turi \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d meaning the government cannot come after him again on this matter. The Justice Department decision, weeks before the election, coupled with the now public emails, cast a new light on Clinton's 2013 Benghazi testimony where she was asked about the movement of weapons by Sen. Rand Paul. Paul: Were any of these weapons transferred to other countries. Any countries. Turkey included? Clinton: Well, senator you'll have to direct that question to the agency that ran the annex and I will see what information is available. Paul: You're saying you don't know? Clinton: I don't know. Turi first told his story to Fox News senior executive producer Pamela Browne in 2014, and since, Turi says he's lost everything to fight the Justice Department, which had no further comment beyond the publicly available court records. \"With all the resources that they were throwing at me, I knew there would have to be some type of explanation of the operation that was going terribly wrong in Libya,\" Turi said. \"It is completely un-American...I was a contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency.\" Turi said he is grateful the case is over. \"It really is ungodly, and unjust and unconscionable, that the entire force of the United States government came after me for a simple application. I was working for the U.S. government.\" Turi added, \"I never shipped anything. I never even received the contract. So all I received was an approval for $534 million to support our interests overseas. And it would have been the United States government that facilitated that operation from Qatar and UAE by way of allowing those countries to land their planes and land their ships in Libya.\" Close friend and Turi adviser Robert Stryk described Turi this way to Fox News in a statement: \u201cMarc Turi is a true patriot who served his country in the fight against Islamofascist terrorists in the Middle East. His fraudulent prosecution by Hillary Clinton\u2019s associates in the Justice Department is deplorable as is the fate of the American heroes murdered in Benghazi. Our most loyal citizens deserve better.\" And Turi hinted there is more to emerge on the 2012 Benghazi attacks which killed four Americans including Stevens. \"Now there\u2019s a flip side to this. Some of the operations that I was involved in, in another country for the agency has a linkage and there\u2019s a backstory to the actual buy-back program of the surface to air missiles that were shipped and mysteriously disappeared out of Benghazi,\" Turi said. \"So we can save that for another time, but the reality is a lot of this could have exposed a number of covert operations that I don\u2019t think the American public would really want to know at this point in time.\u201d Fox News asked the State Department about Turi\u2019s allegations, and whether no weapons reached extremists groups on Clinton\u2019s watch.\u00a0 A spokesperson said they would check.",

            "article_content": "John Roberts reports from New York Americans braved long lines and a tense Election Day climate to deliver the final verdict Tuesday in the raucous race for the White House between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, as the campaigns made last-minute bids to drive out turnout in what could be a close contest. \u201cGo out and vote,\u201d Trump urged on Fox News, as he talked up his chances in key battlegrounds. As Clinton cast a vote for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y., she was met by cheering crowds and told reporters the experience was \u201chumbling.\u201d \u201cI know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election,\" she said, as she aims to make history and become the first woman elected U.S. president. The historic day started off neck-and-neck in three early-voting New Hampshire precincts. Polls opened and shut quickly in the tiny hamlets of Dixville Notch, Hart\u2019s Location and Millsfield just after midnight Tuesday. Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. Clinton won more votes in Dixville Notch and Hart\u2019s Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield, with a 16-4 advantage. The traditional early vote in New Hampshire kicked off what promises to be a busy election day, after Trump and Clinton visited key battleground states late Monday into early Tuesday to make one last plea to American voters. Speaking in Grand Rapids, Mich., Trump urged voters to ask themselves before they entered the voting booth: \u201cDo you want America to be ruled by the corrupt political class or do you want America to be ruled by the people? \u201cToday is our independence day, today the American working class is going to strike,\u201d he added. Clinton visited North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C., for a midnight rally. Clinton was led in by performances from Jon Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga and then by her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea. \u201cTomorrow night this election will end but I want you to understand that our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country.\u201d Clinton also made her final plea to middle class voters. Clinton\u2019s speech in Raleigh echoed her entire trip Monday as she made her final campaign stops in key states. Clinton vowed to unite a divided nation. \u201cAnger is not a plan,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said in Pittsburgh, Pa. As Clinton spent the day blasting what she called her opponent\u2019s \u201cdivisive vision\u201d for America, Trump blamed her and her husband\u2019s policies for manufacturing job losses and vowed a change if he\u2019s elected. \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you. We\u2019re going to bring back wealth taken from this country,\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, said in battleground state North Carolina, the second of his five stops Monday. He pulled out all the stops at the second to last rally of his campaign in Manchester, New Hampshire. Trump appeared with his running mate Mike Pence and many members of his family at the SNHU Arena, the same arena where he held his final rally before the New Hampshire primary. His win in that race paved his way to the party's nomination. \"It all began for me in New Hampshire,\" Trump said after taking the stage. The race remains tight in the final hours. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows Trump\u2019s prospects improving in four key states -- Arizona, Iowa, Utah and North Carolina \u2013 though Clinton still has the advantage on the electoral map. Clinton made her final campaign swing Monday, less than 24 hours after the FBI concluded a revived probe into her personal email use as secretary of state, lifting a cloud off her campaign in the final hours as she seeks to become the first woman elected president in U.S. history. Before embarking on her three-state campaign swing, Clinton told reporters that she has \"some work to do to bring the country together\" and that she wants to be president for those who vote for her and those who don't. Trump on Monday resumed his breakneck race through the country to make a final appeal to voters to help him \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. In the wake of the FBI announcement, he urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box.\" \u201cShe wants to fight ISIS?\u201d Trump said Monday in North Carolina about Clinton, who has essentially led for the entire 2016 election cycle. \u201cShe wants to fight nobody. She\u2019s got no chance.\u201d Trump is aiming for an upset victory Tuesday, which is still possible if he is able to win key toss-up states and pick off one or more strategic states considered Democratic territory. The former reality TV star shocked the country\u2019s political class this spring when he defeated 16 major candidates in the Republican primaries, among them several senators and governors. While seeking victories in the so-called battleground states, which have a mix of voters who could go for either major party candidate, Pennsylvania is considered critical for Trump. The state has not elected a GOP presidential nominee since 1988 in the candidates\u2019 race to get 270 Electoral College votes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Clinton also invited mothers whose sons were killed by police officers to speak on stage at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 though the same convention also featured a speech by Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez. Still, Clinton's decision not to seek The Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s stamp of approval makes Clinton just the second Democratic presidential candidate in at least the last 20 years not to do so. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, also did not seek the endorsement of the union, which represents 335,000 members. The FOP endorsed Bill Clinton in 1996, but has given the nod to Republicans in 2000, 2004 and 2008. The union did not endorse any candidate in 2012. \u201cWe were talking to the highest levels of the campaign, and we had all indications that she was going to return the questionnaire,\u201d FOP President Chuck Canterbury told The Hill on Friday. \u201cAnd on the deadline date we were advised that they declined.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign, speaking to The Hill, did not directly address why the form wasn\u2019t submitted, but instead focused on how \u201cHillary and her team had engaged law enforcement throughout the campaign.\u201d \u201cAs she said from the beginning of her campaign, across the country, police officers are out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, putting themselves on the line to save lives,\u201d Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said. \u201cShe believes we must work together to build on what\u2019s working and to build the bonds of trust between police and the communities they serve \u2013 because we are stronger together.\u201d Trump has submitted his endorsement paperwork, and Canterbury stressed Trump\u2019s \u201clong history of being friendly to law enforcement.\u201d Giuliani said the choice not to submit the FOP questionnaire is indicative of the extreme left swing of the current Democrat Party and its presidential candidate. \u201cI think this only makes the point that the Democratic Party has gone so far to the left now \u2013 so far to the left \u2013 that it won\u2019t even seek the endorsement of the major police organization in the country,\u201d Giuliani said.",

John Kitzhaber and his staff mismanaged the creation of the state\u2019s doomed health insurance website, including by making decisions based on his re-election campaign, according to a congressional report released Wednesday which seeks a criminal probe. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report calls for the Department of Justice and state attorney general to conduct criminal investigations into the events surrounding the creation and eventual failure of Cover Oregon, which ultimately led to the waste of $305 million in federal money. \"More than $305 million in federal taxpayer dollars were sent to\u00a0Oregon\u00a0state for purposes of implementing a state exchange to benefit the people,\" the Republican-led committee said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \"The state exchange never came to fruition, and the money is gone.\" The report also found there has been no effort from the Department for Health and Human Services to retrieve the lost funds. The report said that state officials improperly commingled official and political resources to enrich Kitzhaber\u2019s re-election bid. Democrats on the committee released their own report, which laid the blame at the feet of Oracle Corporation, the state\u2019s contractor, saying it misled officials and failed to deliver a functioning website. The Democrats' report also found that Oracle\u2019s work was so flawed the state should stop payments to them. Oregon\u00a0had the country's worst rollout of the national health insurance program. While the crippled federal website eventually worked,\u00a0Oregon failed to enroll a single person online. The state-supported platform eventually was abandoned for the federal HealthCare.gov. Cover Oregon was dissolved in March 2015. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' \"failed oversight of the development and implementation of Cover\u00a0Oregon\u00a0resulted in millions of wasted taxpayer dollars,\" the committee\u2019s report said, calling for the reform of its grant and oversight process. The report also found that state officials and Kitzhaber\u2019s campaign staff collaborated to such an extent that the \"lines between official and political activities became blurry.\u201d Kitzhaber resigned in February 2015 amid allegations his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, did private consulting work for organizations seeking to influence state policies. The report found that at least one email discussing Cover Oregon included Hayes, \"who did not have any Cover\u00a0Oregon\u00a0role or responsibilities.\" Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The column, written by Peter Makhlouf, was written following the Feb. 3 decision by Brown University\u2019s faculty to create a partnership between the school and the Navy and Air Force ROTC programs Makhlouf is calling for the campus to ban the ROTC programs. \u201cBy outlawing ROTC and its byproducts on our campus, we have the opportunity to maintain and strengthen a tradition of refusing to capitulate to the increasing demands of military engagement in today\u2019s global agenda,\u201d Makhlouf wrote in The Brown Daily Herald. \u201cName just one criminal act committed by the ROTC?\" \u201cIt\u2019s a bit disillusioned to think that Brown students should be exposed to every potential career \u2014 even more unthinkable to assume that they should be exposed to all potential military careers,\u201d he wrote. The piece continues: \u201cAdmittedly, Brown is more active than most schools, though the overwhelmingly centrist nature of our campus\u2019 political discourse should be further reason for opposing military presence. The push for normalizing militarism on our campus needs to be opposed because Brown students are so often unsure of their political leanings.\u201d The stand by Makhlouf, who expects to graduate in 2016, earned him criticism from readers who posted comments to his Op-Ed. Rae Shue wrote:\u00a0 \u201cAs one who served, I have this to say to you: those of us who have served or are serving made the choice to serve. We did this because there are evils out there that must be fought and only a select few will answer that call. We serve so you can choose not to. We sacrifice our present and future so you don't have to.\u201d Many commenters slammed what they deemed Makhlouf\u2019s poor grammar and writing style, while others challenged his facts. \u201cName just one criminal act committed by the ROTC. Take your time...I'll wait,\u201d wrote Thomas Mag Malaglowicz. And Daric Wade wrote, \u201cYou completely misunderstand the term \"military science\", as applied to ROTC. Military Science courses are designed to teach the \"science\" of military leadership, decision-making, and tactical thinking, in very basic forms, not to invent new weapons. Nobody's building a death ray at Brown.\u201d",

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) (The Associated Press) CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2013 Seated in one of two offices he maintains on the Harvard University campus, William Julius Wilson points to the far wall and his framed citation for the 1998 National Medal of Science, only the second one given to a sociologist. \"When President Clinton introduced me, he proceeded to talk about my book 'The Truly Disadvantaged,' and all these national scientists saw that the president not only read my book but could talk about it and had been influenced by it,\" he says. Clinton knew the book so well he even mentioned the page count, 187. As soon as he got back home, Wilson says, \"I pulled the book off the shelf, and yeah, the book was 187 pages of text.\" Sociologists rarely achieve fame beyond their peers, but Wilson's influence extends from the campus to the inner city to television to the White House. National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates has called him an intellectual deity, a \"gawd.\" David Simon of \"The Wire\" has said Wilson helped inspire the second season of the HBO program set in Baltimore. Members of the Clinton and Obama administrations have cited his work and sought his advice. Wilson, who turned 80 in December, spoke with The Associated Press about his decades of thinking and writing about race, class, education and poverty and about how his ideas run through today's news stories, whether on income inequality or the Black Lives Matter movement. \"We should be cognizant of the choices available to inner-city families and residents in high jobless inner-city black neighborhoods,\" he says, \"because they live under constraints and face challenges that most people in the larger society do not experience, or can't even imagine.\" Some of Wilson's books have become standards, notably \"The Declining Significance of Race,\" ''The Truly Disadvantaged\" and \"When Works Disappears.\" Combining field work, historical research and ideas rooted in experience and scholarship, Wilson has shaped a clear narrative: Over the past 60 years, black neighborhoods have been devastated by the departure of the middle class, the elimination of manufacturing jobs, declines in wages and cuts in government support. Income inequality among blacks, once relatively small, now surpasses the gap among whites. The poorest areas \u2014 what Wilson has called \"extreme poverty\" \u2014 suffer from a self-reinforcing absence of role models, networking opportunities, transportation and social and training skills. Affirmative action programs, he has written, are worthwhile, but only help those already in position to have a job. \"What's most overwhelming about urban poverty is that it's so difficult to escape,\" then-Sen. Barack Obama said in a 2007 speech widely believed influenced by Wilson's thinking. \"If poverty is a disease that infects an entire community in the form of unemployment and violence, failing schools and broken homes, then we can't just treat those symptoms in isolation. We have to heal that entire community.\" As president, Obama chose as his education secretary Arne Duncan, who says of Wilson: \"He has influenced me more than anyone I could think of.\" \"Wilson virtually invented contemporary urban sociology and reinvigorated the study of the ghetto poor,\" says Michael Eric Dyson, the best-selling author and professor of sociology at Georgetown University. \"Anybody who studies any aspect of the broad impact of race and class, and the topography of black and urban culture, is in his debt.\" And Wilson's research continues. He is an energetic man with a remarkably unlined face and youthful, wiry build who credits genes (his mother lived into her 90s), diet and exercise \u2014 10 hours a week. A recipient of dozens of honorary doctorates, he is busy with one of his most ambitious studies, \"Multidimensional Inequality in the 21st Century,\" a research project on poverty covering everything from the labor market to criminal justice. Born in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, he was one of six children sharing a single room. His father was a coal miner and steel mill worker who died of lung cancer when Wilson was 12. His mother supported the family, as best she could, by working as a housekeeper. He credits an aunt in New York with exposing him to books and culture and giving him the confidence to seek a college education. Wilson was among the first generation of black scholars to benefit from the civil rights legislation of the 1960s \u2014 \"right place, right time,\" he says \u2014 breaking into a field once almost exclusively white. He first joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and was recruited in the early 1970s by the University of Chicago, where he rose to national fame and remained until joining Harvard in 1996. He is now a University Professor, Harvard's highest ranking. With Republicans holding majorities in Congress, Wilson said he has little hope that the lives of poor blacks will improve in the near future, but he does not want to \"wallow in pessimism.\" Asked what programs he would like to see implemented, regardless of their likelihood, Wilson says that he'd like to see a substantial expansion of Neighborhood Promise funding and believes more solutions will arise from his \"Multidimensional Inequality\" project. \"One of the things that the Harvard researchers who are involved in this project have in common is that we all want our research to have some impact outside academia,\" he says. \"We don't want to simply engage other academics.\"",

            "article_content": "Jennifer Griffin reports from Ohio The war of words between presumptive presidential candidates spilled over Monday to their designated attack dogs, with Donald Trump surrogate Scott Brown getting into a bare-knuckles street fight with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, calling on her to take a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage after she took shots at... Trump's hats. Brown \u2013 the ex-Massachusetts senator who lost his seat to Warren in 2012 \u2013 made the DNA remark on a conference call set up by the Republican National Committee on Monday afternoon, hours after Warren appeared with likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Ohio and slammed Trump. Warren, whom Trump regularly calls \u201cgoofy Elizabeth Warren,\u201d used the same terminology to jab back at the billionaire mogul. \u201cDonald Trump says he\u2019ll \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s right there. It\u2019s stamped on the front of his goofy hat. You wanna see goofy? Look at him in that hat.\u201d Warren also called Trump \u201ca small, insecure, money grubber\u201d and \u201ca nasty man\u201d during her introduction of Clinton. Trump, who has frequently referred to himself as an expert counter-puncher, called an MSNBC reporter soon after and unloaded on Warren. Trump told the reporter he hadn\u2019t seen Warren\u2019s speech but was informed of her comments. He then proceeded to mock Warren\u2019s claim of being 1/32nd Cherokee, again referring to Warren as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d \u201cShe made up her heritage, which I think is racist. I think she\u2019s a racist actually because what she did was very racist,\u201d Trump was quoted as saying. \u201cShe\u2019s been totally unable to prove she\u2019s Native American and yet used that to advance her career.\u201d Trump told the reporter he hoped Warren was selected as Clinton\u2019s running mate, saying he was ready to turn \u201cboth barrels\u201d on the pair. The controversy surrounding Warren\u2019s heritage entered the national spotlight during the 2012 Massachusetts senate race when Brown levelled Trump-like charges at Warren, accusing her of lying about her ancestry in the name of career advancement. Warren has said she heard about her Indian lineage from family stories. Brown returned to that line of attack Monday after Trump took his shots, with the two forming a tag-team approach similar to the 1-2 punch adopted by Warren and Clinton earlier in the day. Aside from proposing a DNA test, Brown said Clinton \u201cis considering making someone vice president who has very serious character flaws when it comes to honesty and credibility\u201d in terms of her background. The style of rhetoric from Brown and Trump was in stark contrast to a more moderate, but still-scathing statement sent by the Trump campaign attacking Warren as \u201ca turncoat\u201d for supporting Clinton in light of Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street. Clinton's introduction by Warren, a regular and vocal critic of Wall Street, was a \u201csad attempt at pandering\u201d to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 wing of the party, the statement said. Clinton was far less fiery in her remarks in Cincinnati on Monday, but she did give Warren\u2019s verbal shots at Trump a nod of approval. \u201cI just love how she gets under Donald Trump\u2019s skin,\u201d Clinton said. Monday's heated exchanges were the latest examples of Clinton and Trump trading insults as the general election campaign for both candidates begins in earnest. Referencing Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Trump questioned Clinton's judgement on Friday in a tweet, also using one of his favorite nicknames for the former Secretary of State. \"Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster,\" Trump tweeted. Clinton, meanwhile, has mostly stuck to more civil rebukes, though she often calls Trump out as \"reckless.\" \u201cEvery day, we see how reckless and careless Trump is,\" Clinton said during an event last week. \"He\u2019s proud of it. Well \u2013 that\u2019s his choice. Except when he\u2019s asking to be our President. Then it\u2019s our choice.\" Trump on June 22 devoted an entire speech to criticizing Clinton's entire career, quoting liberally from an upcoming book by a Secret Service agent who railed against Clinton's temperament as well as hitting Clinton on her private e-mail server, The Clinton Foundation and Benghazi. In that speech, Trump called Clinton\u00a0\"the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed Saturday to deport \"criminal illegal immigrants ... within one hour\" of his inauguration if he is elected in November. Trump's promise, made during a speech in Iowa, came after several days of accusations that the real estate mogul had backed down on his signature issue to appeal to undecided general election voters. In an appearance on Fox News' \"Hannity\" Tuesday night, Trump told a town hall audience in Austin, Texas that he was open to \"softening\" current federal immigration law. \"There could certainly be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people,\" Trump said at the time. \"We want to follow the laws, you know, we have very strong laws in this country. And you know Bush, and even Obama, sends people back. Now, we can be more aggressive on that but we want to follow the laws.\" On Saturday, however, Trump said the media had \"missed the whole point on immigration ...\u00a0They take phrases and statements, chop them up, take them out of context and discuss them for days.\" Trump also said that he was developing an \"exit-entry tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas, that they're quickly removed.\" The proposal echoed the language of Trump's former primary rival, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is now advising him. \"My priority is the well-being of 300 million American citizens, including millions of Hispanic citizens and legal residents who want a secure border, and I mean secure,\" said Trump, who maintained his vow to build a wall across America's southern border. Trump touched off controversy during the GOP primary race by vowing to use a \u00a0\"deportation force\u201d to round up and deport millions of illegal immigrants. However, during his appearance on \"Hannity\" this week, Trump said his administration would be willing to \"work with\" illegal immigrants. \"They'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,\" Trump said. The Republican nominee's campaign has twice canceled scheduled speeches where Trump was expected to detail his immigration policy. Trump told Fox News Friday that he would deliver such a speech within the next two weeks. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Scott Bauer) Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is enjoying support from national Republicans as his rematch with Democrat Russ Feingold appears headed for a tight finish. On Saturday, Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence joined the fight in the Badger State. The Indiana governor stood shoulder to shoulder with all the members of Wisonsin's conservative power bloc: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Gov. Scott Walker, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, and Johnson himself. \u201cIt would have been nice to have the posse come around a lot sooner,\" Johnson told reporters. \"But bottom line, I\u2019m glad they are here now, and I think it will make all the difference. And I think it certainly indicates how close this race is.\" Feingold held his Senate seat for 18 years before being defeated by Johnson as part of the 2010 Republican wave. Until recently, Feingold was favored to return the favor, but a recent Marquette University Law School poll showed the race as a virtual tie after previously putting Feingold in front by six points. Both parties have poured money and manpower into the race, seen as crucial to determining control of the Senate. No fewer than\u00a045 outside organizations are now spending money in Wisconsin on Johnson\u2019s behalf. Sixteen of them have spent more than $100,000, which is enough to buy television ads and contribute to the air war. \"This is a man we are going to send back to the United States Senate in a renewed Republican majority,\" Pence told the crowd in Mukwonago. \"A man who was an outsider, a businessman who brought common sense conservative values to the United States Senate and Wisconsin is going to send Johnson back to that renewed majority.\u201d \"We need to return Ron Johnson the United States Senate because he\u2019s a workhorse,\" said Ryan, who has joined up with Johnson's campaign bus tour. \"He\u2019s an effective conservative.\" At a rally in Madison, Feingold jabbed Johnson over abortion, privatization of Social Security, the minimum wage and Donald Trump. \"On these issues with Senator Johnson, you don\u2019t even have a fighting chance,\" said Feingold. \u201c[There is] zero chance he will vote with you against the corporations and the billionaires and the multi-millionaires.\" Feingold and his supporters are up against a Republican ground machine that\u2019s been oiled, tested and refined in the election, recall and re-election of Governor Scott Walker. An internal memo from the Johnson campaign boasts that volunteers for Johnson have knocked on 1.6 million doors in Wisconsin, and they are continuing at a rate of 84,000 visits per week. \"In the final days we are right where we want to be and the wind is at our backs,\u201d one excerpt from the memo reads. Supplementing the party's efforts, the conservative group American Majority Action (AMA) is boasting that their volunteers knocked on 50,000 doors to get out the vote for Johnson. \"Control of the US Senate comes down to Wisconsin,\" AMA National Executive Director Matt Batzel told Fox News. \"This Senate race will be won or lost on the doors in key neighborhoods.\"",

The November 2015 memo included tips like: Do not offer \u201csupport for concrete policy positions;\u201d be sure to \"lead from behind;\" stick to \"small\" meetings; and avoid mentioning terms like \"black-on-black crime.\" On its Facebook page, BLM said officials should \"stop pacifying\" them. \u201cWe are disappointed at the DCCC\u2019s placating response to our demand to value all Black life. Black communities deserve to be heard, not handled. People are dying,\u201d the organization said, in response to the leaked document. The leaked files were posted along with other Democratic documents by Guccifer 2.0, a hacker of unknown origin who the U.S. says could be working out of Russia and is intent on disrupting the U.S. presidential election. Guccifer 2.0 claims the documents were taken from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s personal computer. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill, in a statement, called the leak an \u201cattempt by Russia to influence our election,\u201d while saying Pelosi \u201cdoes not support the content or attitude of this memo.\u00a0On many occasions, Leader Pelosi has publicly supported the ideals embraced by the Black Lives Matter movement and continues to do so.\u201d He also noted Pelosi \u201cdoes not have a personal computer at the DCCC so no hacked, dumped or doctored documents can be attributed to her computer.\u201d It's the latest leak to dog Democrats, after another document dump exposed discussions in the upper reaches of the party about undermining Hillary Clinton primary foe Bernie Sanders. The Nov. 19, 2015, memo was sent to DCCC staff by Troy Perry, who was the DCCC director of diversity but now works for the Clinton campaign. The DCCC is House Democrats' campaign arm. In the email, he lays out the \u201cbest practices\u201d for dealing with Black Lives Matter members. \u201cIf approached by BLM activists, campaign staff should offer to meet with local activists. Invited BLM attendees should be limited,\u201d the email said. \u201cPlease aim for personal or small group meetings. Listen to their concerns, don\u2019t offer support for concrete policy positions.\u201d The memo also urged against mentioning \"black on black crime\" or \"all lives matter.\" \"This response will garner additional media scrutiny and only anger BLM activists,\" the memo said. Meredith Kelly, national press secretary for the DCCC, said in a statement Wednesday that the organization \u201chighly respects and values the leadership of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d \u201cIn less than two years, BLM has evolved from three words into a political force that is changing and waking our nation,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the DCCC, we highly encourage our candidates to not only embrace the importance of this movement, but to meet with and listen to community activists to partner social change.\u201d Black Lives Matter is a national organization that was created in 2012 after the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The movement has since grown and the group has been at the forefront of documenting and protesting the killings of Alton Sterling, a black man shot several times during an encounter with police officers outside a convenience store, and Philando Castile, a Minnesota man whose death was livestreamed on the Internet. Its members have also gotten into confrontations with political candidates, including Democrats.",

            "article_content": "Milwaukee County sheriff says on 'The Kelly File' that the activist organization should be categorized as a hate group Here\u2019s a sobering thought for Americans to contemplate as we now deal with the aftermath of the horrific murders of law enforcement officers in the name of Black Lives Matter in Dallas, Texas: this was mission accomplished for Black Lives Matter, not an aberration. The violence and hate-filled messages pouring out of Black Lives Matter seek exactly this kind of bloody resolution, or revolution, though they cannot admit it in polite society. Even as celebrities clamor over themselves to demonstrate their fealty to the hate group, they align themselves with one of the most destructive groups to the well-being and justice for black Americans that exist today. We are as afraid to point out the obvious, that the sniper attack by Micah Johnson in Dallas, who according to Dallas Police Chief David Brown was \u201cupset about Black Lives Matter,\u201d is just as tied to this domestic hate group as the Orlando terrorist was to radical Islam. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left organization that congratulates itself for its profligate naming of Christian groups and other conservative organizations to its \u2018Hate List\u2019 will prove itself absolutely irrelevant and morally bankrupt if it fails to now name Black Lives Matter and its equally anti-black cohort Black Youth Project to its hate list. I call on them to do so immediately or tear up the list and admit it is the farce that we have known all along. Black Lives Matter has no more to do with black issues than Students for a Democratic Society had to do with Democracy. They are means to an end, and they use the black population as sacrifices for their goals. You see, Black Lives Matter is proving itself to seek only one end \u2013 and that is discord, alienation among Americans, rise in hate, and destruction of community bonds. The relative increase in justice afforded black Americans is of little concern, save as a convenient veneer for their anti-democratic mission. Black Lives Matter has no more to do with black issues than Students for a Democratic Society had to do with Democracy. They are means to an end, and they use the black population as sacrifices for their goals. When black celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 jump on board I can only wonder what their goals are \u2013 more ticket sales? An easy pass from the liberals who control their contracts? It certainly is not to help their community. White America has a responsibility in all this, and it is not the liberal, Hillary-Clinton style enabling of this horrific heist over black Americans or public displays of self-flagellation about privilege. White America needs to be brave, they need to stand up against this latest attack on the Black community by the likes of Black Lives Matter \u2013 to be unafraid to face the condemnation of the powerful but morally reprehensible liberal elites and mainstream media pushing these lies. Stand by the side of law enforcement, the men and women who are often the only semblance of hope and justice in the crime-ridden inner cities. If you want to help Black America, this is the strongest and most necessary course of action you can take. No more walking on eggshells as we stand up for what\u2019s right and recall that America is a land where we are all equal under the law. The facts show that even the most basic premise of Black Lives Matter is an utter fabrication: the leading cause of death among black males ages 15 to25 in American is homicide. We have made strides to help black Americans in recent years, too. Because of Rudy Guiliani\u2019s policies of reducing crime in New York City, tens of thousands of black men, women, and children are alive today that wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise. Stand up to Black Lives Matter. Show you don\u2019t kowtow to the liberal pressure exacted to achieve their political goals on the backs of the suffering of black Americans due to crime and the dissolution of their communities. It is the hard road to sow in our culture where the right thing is shamed and the wrong thing is held up, but as a law enforcement officer I can tell you this is the time for choosing: law and order, justice, the American way or anarchy, division, hate, and authoritarianism. Black Lives Matter has shown their hand in Dallas: they choose the latter.",

            "article_content": "'The O'Reilly Factor' examines the exchange and previews the GOP candidate's policy speech There's a lot of frantic commentary today to the effect that the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, is making a mistake by agreeing to meet with Donald Trump. In a year filled with bad political commentary, this strikes me as some of the worst punditry of the year. Let's start with a few facts: It's a shame that so many ... people who are perfectly happy to break bread with the Castros or leaders of the Chinese Communist Party -- would prefer to see Trump and his supporters treated as international pariahs. Right now, according to Nate Silver's \"polls-plus\" analysis, Trump is on pace to carry states worth 228 electoral votes. Now to put that in perspective, Romney got 206 electoral votes in 2012. Romney got over 60 million votes, and it seems reasonable to assume that Trump will do the same. Sixty million people is a lot of people. It's almost twice the population of Canada (35 million). It's almost three times the population of Australia (23 million). Why would Mexico want to risk offending so many people by refusing to meet with Trump? Furthermore, the Trump voters represent a major chunk of the world economy. Here's a map showing how the gross domestic product (GDP) of each individual American state compares to the GDP of a country. (For example, the GDP of Pennsylvania is roughly equal to the GDP of Turkey): Now let's just look at a few of the states that Trump will likely carry. Texas' GDP is roughly equal to that of Canada. Utah's is roughly equal to that of New Zealand. Indiana's is roughly equal to that of Austria. South Carolina's is roughly equal to that of Finland. Oklahoma's is roughly equal to that of Portugal. Remember that these are only five states, and Trump will likely carry a lot more. Imagine that representatives of Canada, New Zealand, Austria, Finland, and Portugal expressed an interest in meeting with the president of Mexico, in hopes of improving economic and political ties. Wouldn't it be smart for the president to meet with those people? In fact, wouldn't it be political malpractice to refuse such a meeting -- and then to go on TV and publicly denounce their representatives as evil, as some commentators have suggested he do with Trump? Of course it would. So why would it be smart to insult someone likely to carry states that make up a similar share of the global economy? But that's not all. Nate Silver's polls-plus analysis also gives Trump a 27.2 percent chance to be the next president of the United States. Given the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship, it would be foolhardy in the extreme for any president of Mexico to refuse the opportunity to build a useful working relationship with someone who has a better than one-in-four chance of being the next American president. Of course there are people in Mexico who have strong feelings about Trump -- just as there are Americans who have strong feelings about Mexico. But if you're the president of Mexico -- and you are looking to advance the interests of Mexico -- you have to be prepared to work with Trump and his supporters. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply unrealistic. One final point: We are always being told about the importance of negotiations and keeping doors open. We negotiate with Iraq, we negotiate with China, we negotiate with Cuba. We regularly give meetings and photo ops to some of the most odious regimes on the planet -- and when some Americans complain about this, we are always told that doing so leads to a better and safer world. It's a shame that so many people inside the Beltway -- people who are perfectly happy to break bread with the Castros or leaders of the Chinese Communist Party -- would prefer to see Trump and his supporters treated as international pariahs. By agreeing to meet with Trump, the president of Mexico has shown his willingness to be open-minded and work with all Americans. It's too bad that more people in Washington don't feel the same way.",

            "article_content": "A federal appeals court Friday struck down a North Carolina law requiring photo identification to cast in-person ballots, ruling that it was enacted \"with discriminatory intent.\" The opinion from a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., reverses a lower court's ruling that had upheld the law. \"In holding that the legislature did not enact the challenged provisions with discriminatory intent, the court seems to have missed the forest in carefully surveying the many trees,\" the panel wrote in its opinion. The opinion later states: \"We cannot ignore the record evidence that, because of race, the legislature enacted one of the largest restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina history.\" There was no immediate comment from state officials, who were expected to ask either the full appeals court or the U.S. Supreme Court for a temporary stay, blocking enforcement of the ruling until further appeals can be filed. North Carolina is also expected to appeal the case on its merits to either the full appeals court or to the Supreme Court. North Carolina's voting laws were rewritten in 2013 by the General Assembly to include the ID requirement and other changes. The changes were enacted after Republicans took control of state government in 2011 for the first time in a century. The U.S. Justice Department, state NAACP, League of Women Voters and others sued the state, saying the restrictions violated the federal Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. \"This is a strong rebuke to what the North Carolina General Assembly did in 2013. It's a powerful precedent that ... federal courts will protect voting rights of voters of color,\" said Allison Riggs, who served as the League of Women Voters' lead lawyer on the case. The Rev. William Barber, president of the state chapter of the NAACP, said in an interview that the ruling was a powerful victory for civil rights and for democracy. \"It is a vindication of our constitutional and moral critique and challenge to the constitutional extremism of our government,\" he said. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that Texas' strict voter ID law discriminates against minorities and must be weakened before the November elections. That followed a ruling by a federal judge in Wisconsin that residents without a photo ID in that state will still be allowed to vote in November. An attorney representing the state had argued before the appeals court last month that the law's authors were aiming to prevent voter fraud and increase public confidence in elections. The voter ID mandate, which took effect with this year's March primary, required voters to show one of six qualifying IDs, although those with \"reasonable impediments\" can fill out a form and cast a provisional ballot. The laws approved by the General Assembly and signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory also reduced early voting from 17 to 10 days, eliminated same-day registration during early voting and barred the counting of Election Day ballots cast in the wrong precinct. Plaintiffs had argued the changes discourage voting by black and Hispanic residents, who use early voting or same-day registration more than white voters and are more likely to lack photo ID. The appeals court reverses a ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder, who determined in April that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the laws made it harder for minority voters to cast ballots. The federal appeals panel disagreed with Schroeder in a sharply worded opinion. \"We recognize that elections have consequences, but winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination,\" the panel said. \"When a legislature dominated by one party has dismantled barriers to African American access to the franchise, even if done to gain votes, 'politics as usual' does not allow a legislature dominated by the other party to re-erect those barriers.\"",

ObamaCare is the most significant domestic policy overhaul of the past twenty years. And it looks increasingly like it will never be a central issue in even a single presidential campaign. You could hardly call the announcement from the White House that ObamaCare premiums would skyrocket next year an \u201cOctober Surprise.\u201d On the state level, Republicans and Democrats alike have watched for months as the program came unwound. Faced with huge losses, insurance companies have simply opted out of the president\u2019s signature plan. But even so, the size of the forecast increases is pretty stunning. Double-digit premium hikes and a shrinking pool of providers has all the tell-tale signs of the much-discussed \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d Insurers are buckling under the weight of being forced to cover sick customers without offsetting profits from healthy patients who were supposed to be forced into the program by ObamaCare mandates. It was exactly this kind of shock Democrats planned to avoid in 2012 by shoving the implementation of the most noisome parts of the law past the president\u2019s re-election bid. But just imagined what would have happened four years ago had this news fallen into the lap of Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Now, Romney was certainly in a compromised position as it related to ObamaCare. When the president settled on his blueprint for the federal health law, he very intentionally chose one that had been once proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation and implemented by Romney in Massachusetts. When Obama made his choice for a consumer mandate in 2009, it was already clear that Romney was one of the frontrunners, if not the top contender, for the Republican nomination in 2012. Hanging the controversial, unpopular federal mandate on Romney was good short-term politics, but also a nice investment in Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. But even a compromised Romney would\u2019ve had no trouble wailing away on Obama for short-sighted planning, mismanagement and improvident expectations. And it might\u2019ve really made a difference. Two weeks before the 2012 election, Romney trailed in an average of credible national polls by just a single point, as opposed to the current Republican nominee\u2019s deficit of more than 6 points. And in the RCP averages in the four dominant swing states, Romney led in Florida by 2 points and in North Carolina by 5 points. The former Massachusetts governor trailed in must-win Ohio by just over 2 points, and Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania was out of reach at a deficit of almost 6 points, but Romney\u2019s path to 270 was still certainly open with two weeks to go. Compare that to Romney\u2019s successor as Republican nominee. Donald Trump\u00a0trails Democratic opponent\u00a0Hillary Clinton in the RCP average for Florida by about 3 points and in North Carolina by 2 points. Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania deficit is about the same as Romney\u2019s and Trump is certainly doing better in Ohio, where he holds an advantage of about 1 point. But if the election was held today, Clinton would already be above 300 electoral votes and potentially heading for the largest margin since 1996. Trump and his campaign are trying to dive on the ObamaCare fumble to rally for a late touchdown drive. But they are starting on their own five yard line. Romney was in the red zone at this point in 2012, but couldn\u2019t figure out a way to punch through Obama\u2019s defenses. The 2010 and 2014 midterm elections were largely litigated around ObamaCare, much to the chagrin of Democrats. The law has remained broadly unpopular, with nothing like the kind of buy-in that other major social welfare programs obtained. The 2008 election did feature a major discussion on health care, at least in the Democratic primaries, but by the general election the septic financial system overshadowed any discussion about tax credits, or purchasing plans across state lines. We can\u2019t be sure how much Trump will try to make out of ObamaCare\u2019s unraveling, or if voters will really pay attention. Trump\u2019s dominant closing argument that he is not guilty of an alleged series of sexual assaults will certainly overshadow anything his policy shop might crank out on health care. So in all likelihood, the most significant public policy change of the last generation will grind on into history without ever being the subject of a single presidential referendum.

Pew Research has done extensive research on the effect that interviewers have on sensitive or emotional questions. As an example, many phone respondents may be reluctant to admit they are likely to vote for Trump when being interviewed by a female or African American interviewer (which is most likely the vast majority of phone interviewers. The response is likely to be significantly more honest when answering an online poll, where there is no gasping at the respondent\u2019s gross stupidity or racial hatred. I\u2019ve been in the opinion polling business for over forty years.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Pete Booth, Atlanta [Ed. note: You make an excellent point, Mr. Booth! One of the great appeals of online polling, as well as automated polling by telephone, is that it allows respondents to feel less social pressure from an interviewer. Certainly for market research and other functions, online polls have already proven their worth. But when it comes to accurately tracking or forecasting a presidential election, the disadvantages of online polling\u00a0\u2013\u00a0technological barriers to participation for older and poor voters and suspicion of online solicitation among others -- means that good, old fashioned live interviewer telephone calls are still the best way to go.] \u201cTrump\u2019s next book should be titled \u2018The Art of Snatching Defeat From the\u00a0Jaws of Victory.\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen anyone do a better job of that \u2013 not just once, but every time he managed to pull ahead!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Peggie Hall, North Little Rock, Ark. [Ed. note: Ms. Hall, you could have a future in marketing. But take it a little easier on Trump. He has never been ahead in an average of real polls, not since the day general election started in May. That\u2019s not to say that it hasn\u2019t been much closer than it\u2019s been in the closing weeks. And that's certainly not to say that Trump didn\u2019t squander some opportunities. But Republicans start every election at a disadvantage because of the electoral map and the demographics of the electorate. The GOP\u2019s selection of such an unconventional candidate was hoped by some to ameliorate some of those deficiencies.

(iStock) Just a couple of years after the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in New York Harbor, a statue of Christopher Columbus was erected to grace Barcelona's skyline\u2014and while the former represents freedom and friendship, local council members say the latter should be torn down for symbolizing the worst of colonialism, reports the Guardian. The officials are formally requesting that the nearly 200-foot bronze figure, which went up in 1888, be dismantled, as well as all the adornments at the base of the column\u2014including effigies of Columbus' sponsors, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, per the Telegraph\u2014that \"glorify the conquest of America and its 'museumification' through historical interpretation.\" Instead, the far-left officials say, a better tribute would be some kind of structure signifying \"American resistance to imperialism, oppression, and indigenous and African-American segregation.\" That's not all the CUP Capgirem members are looking to eliminate. Also on the hit list: a statue of a slave trader outside Barcelona's post office, the Spanish flags that adorn municipal buildings, and Columbus Day celebrations on Oct. 12. Other Spanish officials have voiced displeasure at the holiday in the past, with the mayor of the port city of Cadiz tweeting last year, \"We never discovered America; we massacred and suppressed a continent and its cultures in the name of God.\" The request has been met with some scorn by other parties, with one local leader sniffing, \"Next thing you know, the CUP will ask for a statue of Kim Jong Un pointing at Ithaca.\" Meanwhile, Barcelona's deputy mayor said Tuesday that taking down the Columbus statue \"is not part of the changes we currently have planned.\" A stolen Columbus letter was found in a US institution.

            "article_content": "Gary Gastelu hits the track at Lime Rock Park in the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro SS. There are a lot of ways to build a better sports car, but here\u2019s the best: Make it lighter, smaller, stiffer, sleeker and more powerful than the one it replaces. Easy. Case in point: the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro SS. OK, it wasn\u2019t exactly easy. Rather than try to trim and train the old Camaro SS, which was a clumsy, overweight street brawler, GM needed to start this one with a fresh slate. To do that, it borrowed the platform from the Cadillac ATS \u2013 a lightweight, mass-optimized masterpiece of a compact coupe that\u2019s as world-class as they come. Then it went to work. The instrument panel frame? Aluminum. So are the front suspension links. The ones in the rear are made of steel, but they have holes in them where the metal wasn\u2019t going to do anything but take up space. This alone reportedly saved 26 pounds. Speed holes! The result is a car that weighs more than 200 pounds less than its predecessor, is rock solid and looks it. The new body, though familiar in style, has a tight waist, muscular haunches and skeletal forms stretching its skin. I think there\u2019s even a thigh gap. Tucked inside is a powertrain copped from the Corvette Stingray that includes a 455 hp 6.2-liter V8 with 455 lb-ft of torque, either a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission and a limited slip rear differential. GM\u2019s remarkable magnetic ride control suspension, with dampers that adjust up to 1,000 times per second to deliver a delicious blend of comfort and handling, is optional, but it\u2019s the best $1,695 you\u2019ll ever spend. That\u2019s on top of the Camaro SS\u2019s $37,295 starting price, a confident $2,795 premium over the last-generation Camaro SS that\u2019s worth every buck. It\u2019s also four grand more than its longtime rival, the Mustang GT, which is an excellent machine, but a bigger, heavier and less powerful one. In fact, when word got out during the launch of the latest Mustang GT that the Camaro was getting liposuction, the folks at Ford started talking about how their customers actually asked for a burly car. Unless Anonymous gets around to leaking the notes from Ford\u2019s consumer clinics, we\u2019ll never really know if that\u2019s the truth or historical revisionism, but the latest rumor is that Ford has accelerated development on the next Mustang in response to this Camaro. And it should, if performance is all that matters. The Camaro is quicker in a straight line (0-60 mph in the low 4s and around a 12-second quarter-mile), sticks better in turns and is well balanced in the middle of them. Its fast steering, responsive throttle, anchor-like brakes and accurate shifter make it instinctive to drive on the track. It can take a beating there, too. The Camaro SS has three radiators, plus transmission and differential coolers. Chevy says you should be able to burn through a tank of gas on the track without anything overheating or breaking, and it will honor the warranty if something does. I\u2019m pretty sure the Perito Moreno glacier moved farther than the temperature gauges in the Camaro SS as I knocked off a couple of dozen laps on the autocross at Lime Rock Park. The new Camaro also has a much improved interior. It could still use a few more soft touches, but it\u2019s decked out nicely with a modern style. Even though it\u2019s smaller overall, a double-bubble roof clears enough space for you to wear a helmet without it scraping the ceiling \u2013 impossible for 6-foot, 1-inch me in the old one. Unfortunately, those gun-slit windows aren\u2019t big enough for you to squeeze through while you have one on, so if you crash, hope one of the doors still opens. Chevy even figured out something to do with the otherwise useless rear seats. It put an optional wireless smartphone charging pad on the hump between them. Too bad you have to plug in a USB cable to use the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto features on the infotainment system. It\u2019s still a Camaro, of course, with the drama (and stigma!) the model has always exhibited, but this one backs it up. As a lifelong Mustang guy with a natural aversion to the Camaro born from growing up in New Jersey during the era of mullets, hair metal and IROC-Zs, I can say with much authority that in the never-ending battle between the Camaro SS and the Mustang GT, this Chevy has won the day. ---------- 2016 Chevrolet Camaro SS Base price: $37,295 As tested: $46,095 Type: 4-passenger, 2-door, rear-wheel-drive coupe Engine: 6.2-liter V8 Power: 455 hp, 455 lb-ft Transmission: 6-speed manual MPG: 16 city/25 hwy",

The lawsuit alleges the defendants \"have repeatedly incited their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities.\" The lawsuit was filed hours before two Texas police officers were injured in a shooting while responding to a suicide call. Pennie, who is black, is being represented by Larry Klayman, founder of the organization Freedom Watch. \u201cThe defendants, if not legally reined in, are allegedly responsible, along with others, for igniting a race war that will ultimately totally destroy the freedoms that our Founding Fathers bequeathed to us,\u201d Klayman said in a press release.",

            "article_content": "Advocates and lawmakers on both sides used the decision to point to the importance of the fall election; Shannon Bream has the story for 'Special Report' A prominent southwest university\u2019s medical school could face a criminal probe after it was revealed that students dissected aborted fetal brains and other body parts at a summer camp. The University of New Mexico was accused of illegally transferring fetal tissue by the House Select Panel of Infant Lives in a recent letter to New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas. \u201cDocumentation obtained by the panel in the course of its investigation reflects that the transfer of fetal tissue from SWWO to UNM for research purposes is a direct violation of New Mexico\u2019s Jonathan Spradling Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,\u201d wrote Panel Chair Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. Blackburn charged the school broke state laws governing the use of aborted fetal tissue it received from Southwestern Women\u2019s Options, which provides late-term abortions. Published reports said the tissue was used for research and even dissected at what has been described as summer camps in 2012 and 2014. The House panel was organized in October 2015 in the wake of the controversial Planned Parenthood videos depicting the sale of aborted fetal tissue. Blackburn told Balderas that university officials trained new abortion doctors, referred women to outside abortion clinics, sent UNM faculty and residents to an abortion clinic during transition between owners, extended \u201cvoluntary faculty\u201d status to local abortionists, supplied residents and fellows to perform abortions for SWWO, and put pressure on employees and students for political support, all in violation of state law.. Blackburn\u2019s letter was accompanied by a scathing 291-page report outlining the relationship between UNM and SWWO and the use and advocacy of aborted tissues for research. \u201cToday, UNM Hospital performs surgical abortions for any reason through 25 weeks gestation,\u201d said the report. \u201cSince the time when opposition to participating in abortion procedures was the predominant view of UNM medical staff, the culture appears to have changed\u2014along with the composition of UNM hospital and clinic personnel\u2014to one aggressively in favor of the expansion of abortion.\u201d UNM officials admitted that the tissues were used for research purposes. Outrage emerged when the Albuquerque Journal reported that in 2012 and 2014, the university held a summer program where aborted fetal brains were dissected. \u201cThis was the tipping point of the depravity and lack of respect for human life,\u201d said Elisa Martinez, founder and executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life. In a videotaped interview Paul Roth, M.D., dean for the UNM School of Medicine admitted dissections were conducted but would not elaborate. \u201cWe had a faculty member, who in fact, obtained some tissue and, during one of these summer workshops dissected, I think one or two fetal brains,\u201d said Roth. The House received disturbing documentation in regards to the summer camp. The custom ordering of brains for \"summer camp students\" is taken from UNM Health Sciences Centers, \"Procurement Notes\" notebook, in which an unnamed university staffer wrote: \"Asked clinic for digoxin treated tissue 24-28 wks. for methylation study & because [name redacted] wants whole, fixed brains to dissect w/ summer camp students.\" The school has not elaborated on the notes or the ages of camp participants. \u201cThe fashion in which the nameless UNMHSC employee custom orders baby's brains from Boyd's abortion clinic is shocking and disgusting-- but worse, the UNMHSC employee order babies' brains to dissect with summer camp students,\u00a0 which is admitted by UNM HSC chief administrator in the video obtained by New Mexico Alliance for Life,\u201d said Martinez. Frank Scaturro, special counsel for the U.S. House Select Panel on Infant Lives, said he would hope New Mexico takes the recommendation seriously. \u201cI would think if it would come from a legislative body I would think it would carry weight,\u201d says Scaturro. A spokesman for Balderas confirm receipt of the criminal referral. \"I can confirm the Office of the Attorney General has received a public referral and this matter is under review,\u201d said James Hallinan. \u201cAll complaints received by the Office of the Attorney General are fully reviewed and appropriate action is taken.\"",

            "article_content": "College Republicans blast Dartmouth administration for how it handled vandalism; reaction on 'Outnumbered' A display at Dartmouth College honoring law enforcement officers was removed Friday and replaced with Black Lives Matter signs after just one day, members of the Dartmouth College Republicans said. In place of the \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d tribute, which was created during National Police Week, were four fliers reading: \u201cYou cannot co-opt the movement against state violence to memorialize its perpetrators. #blacklivesmatter,\u201d The Dartmouth Review reported. \u201cThe next morning we got up and we saw that our display was torn apart and replaced with Black Lives Matter posters,\u201d Dartmouth College Republicans President Michelle Knesbach told Fox News on Monday. Mikala Williams, a student involved in replacing the police display with Black Lives Matter literature, said the tribute to cops undermined concerns about police brutality. \"By framing that as '[Blue Lives Matter,' it normalizes and naturalizes violence against people of color in this country,\" she told The Dartmouth. \"And that is not okay. That is in no way okay.\" Knesbach, however, said the activism went beyond the billboard revamp. \u201cThroughout the entirety of the day, 25 Black Lives Matter protesters were standing in front of billboards,\u201d she told On the Record's Greta Van Susteren. \u201cNot only did they replace our billboard with their display, they also replaced all of the other billboards in the student center with Black Lives Matter posters and posted pictures of our club members\u2019 faces with \u2018Sons of Old Dartmouth\u2019 written over it.\u201d School administrators reportedly didn\u2019t respond or condemn the incident until two days later. College President Phil Hanlon sent a campus-wide email Sunday calling the initial remove of the police display \"an unacceptable violation of freedom of expression.\" But Hanlon also equated the billboard drama to a November incident in which Black Lives Matter t-shirts were removed from a display. Initially, the College Republicans were not allowed to replace the  police display due to \u201csafety and security\u201d concerns, Knesbach said. But Collins Center director Anna Hall told The Dartmouth that the Black Lives Matter posters were taken down Saturday morning to allow the reposting of the police tribute. A sign on the board Sunday night read \"We will not be silenced, Blue Lives Matter,\u201d according to The Dartmouth.",

(AP Photo/David Goldman) (The Associated Press) Mourners gather before the funeral service for Ethel Lance, one of the nine people killed in the shooting at Emanuel AME Church last week in Charleston, Thursday, June 25, 2015, in North Charleston, S.C. (AP Photo/David Goldman) (The Associated Press) CHARLESTON, South Carolina \u2013 The site of a massacre a week ago, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is being reclaimed by parishioners who are pledging to remember the loved ones they lost in a shooting rampage while carrying on the work of the beloved pastor who was killed beside them. Only hours before the body of Clementa Pinckney was to be returned to the historic black church for his wake, members and non-members packed into the church's basement to attend Wednesday night Bible study. Pinckney and eight parishioners were gunned down in the same place a week earlier in what authorities are investigating as a hate crime. \"Because of our faith, we've shown up once more again to declare that Jesus lives and because he lives, we can face tomorrow,\" interim pastor Norvel Goff told a multiracial crowd. The first funerals were to begin Thursday. President Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy at Pinckney's funeral Friday. In the church's basement, there was little evidence of the violence. Workers at the church had covered bullet holes in the wall and removed other traces of the attack, church spokeswoman Maxine Smith said. The 41-year-old minister on Wednesday became the first African-American since Reconstruction in the late 1800s to rest in honor in South Carolina's Statehouse Rotunda. Pinckney served the people from the Statehouse for nearly 20 years, including as a senator. Authorities say the viewing drew 4,000 mourners. As mourners filed by his open casket, a makeshift drape over a huge window obscured the secessionist Confederate battle flag outside on the Statehouse grounds, emphasizing how quickly the symbol of Southern pride has fallen into official disrepute. Dylann Storm Roof was captured a day after the shootings when a motorist spotted his Confederate license plate. Images on a website created in Roof's name months before the attacks show him posing with the Confederate flag and burning and desecrating the U.S. flag. Gov. Nikki Haley started the groundswell against Confederate icons Monday by successfully calling on South Carolina lawmakers to debate taking down the Confederate battle flag flying in front of the Statehouse. Then Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley issued an executive order that brought down four of the flags Wednesday. He compared the banner to the universally shunned symbols of Nazi Germany, a stunning reversal in a region where the Confederacy was formed 154 years ago. Other lawmakers and activists have taken aim at symbols including a bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest in Tennessee's Senate and a sculpture of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in the Kentucky Rotunda. Businesses also have acted swiftly. Wal-Mart, eBay, Amazon and Target are among those saying Confederate merchandise will be gone from their stores and online sites. A growing number of Confederate symbols have been defaced by graffiti. The words \"Black Lives Matter\" were spray-painted Wednesday on a century-old Confederate memorial in St. Louis, not far from Ferguson, Missouri, where the phrase took root after a white officer killed an unarmed black man last August. Goff used his time at Emanuel's Bible study to call for continued calm in Charleston in the face of the tragedy. \"We may not be in control of those who commit evil acts, but we are in control of how we respond to it,\" he said. ___ Jonathan Drew and Meg Kinnard in Charleston; Seanna Adcox, Jeffrey Collins, Susanne M.

            "article_content": "Fireworks at Hofstra University After years of campaigning for the nominations of their political parties, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the right to debate each other at Hofstra University Monday night in the first presidential debate of 2016. The Clinton campaign spent the last several days pushing the mainstream media, including debate moderator NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, to fact-check their view of the facts.\u00a0 The push from the political media was intense, and Lester Holt didn\u2019t disappoint the left.\u00a0 Holt failed to ask a single question about corruption allegations against the Clinton Foundation The more than 90 minute back and forth conversation between Trump and Clinton successfully highlighted the differences between the two candidates.\u00a0 Here are my top 16 debate moments that defined the night: 1. Hillary Clinton\u2019s answer to a question about how she planned to create jobs. -- It was all about what the government can and will do if she becomes president.\u00a0 Mrs. Clinton has no private sector experience to build on. Her answers reflected her experience. 2. When Trump slammed Clinton by saying \u201cyou\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. Why haven\u2019t you been able to implement any of these ideas?\u201d 3. When Hillary Clinton embraced her husband\u2019s economic policies by saying, \u201cMy husband did a pretty good job\u201d; to which Trump responded by saying \u201cHe signed NAFTA. And it\u2019s been a disaster.\u201d 4. When Trump turned a question about releasing his taxes into a challenge to Clinton. The Republican said he will release his taxes, against his lawyers\u2019 wishes, IF Clinton releases the 33,000 emails she deleted. 5. When Trump hit Clinton hard for the simple apology she always gives for using a secret personal server and avoiding government transparency laws. (Hint: \"It was a mistake.\") He said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was on purpose.\u201d 6. After Clinton responded to a question on the unfolding violence in Charlotte, N.C., Trump jumped in to say \u201cSecretary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to use a few words -- like law and order.\u201d 7. When Clinton made a long and passionate statement against the policing policy of stop and frisk. 8. When Clinton claimed the U.S. criminal justice system has \u201csystemic racism\u201d in it. 9. When Trump reminded viewers that Clinton created the term \u201csuper predator\u201d for young black men. 10. When Clinton gave a long answer on what she would do to ensure that foreign governments don\u2019t get access to private servers in the U.S. (and then failed to mention that she didn\u2019t do it for her own private server \u2013 which was hacked). 11. When Trump pushed back on Clinton\u2019s claim that Russia has hacked the DNC. \u201cIt may be Russia, it may also be China or someone else. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d 12. When Trump slammed Clinton on her record: \u201cYou were Secretary of State when ISIS was small, now they are huge.\u201d 13. When Hillary defended the Iran deal. 14. When Clinton said emphatically that she didn\u2019t say that the TPP trade deal was the \u201cGold Standard.\u201d (Which she did say and the fact checkers proved she said it immediately after she denied it.) 15. When Trump said dramatically: \u201cShe [Hillary] has experience, but it is bad experience\u201d 16. When Trump said he will support Clinton if she wins; Clinton merely said she \u201csupports our democracy\u201d but failed to specifically say she will support Trump if he wins. In the end, Trump easily proved that Hillary Clinton\u2019s multi-million dollar advertising campaign to define him as a two-headed monster was not accurate.\u00a0 Trump was tough, but fair; gracious, but firm.\u00a0 Clinton was prepared but robotic. After Monday night\u2019s debate, Team Hillary will need to go back to the drawing board to find a strategy that will stop Trump\u2019s current momentum. The estimated 100 million people who watched the two candidates face off against each other now know that Hillary\u2019s caricature of Trump was wrong. -- She was a classic politician forced to defend the status quo and he was the outsider articulating a need for change. With forty-one days left before Americans go to the polls, Clinton is running out of time to push a coherent message as to why the Democrats deserve a third term.",

            "article_content": "2016 Ford Ranger (Ford) Ford is making plans for a return to the small pickup truck market in the U.S. with a new version of the Ranger. The company is negotiating with the United Auto Workers about making the truck at a factory in the Detroit suburb of Wayne, Michigan, a person briefed on the matter said Wednesday. A new small SUV that may be called the Bronco also is under discussion, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are part of national contract negotiations and no agreement has been reached. The Wayne factory, which Ford calls the Michigan Assembly Plant, employs more than 4,400 workers. The 5-million-square-foot facility now makes the Focus compact and C-Max gas-electric hybrid. Ford is expected to move those products to a lower-cost factory in Mexico in 2018, but has yet to confirm the move. Yee haw! The Ford Bronco turns 50 \"We actively are pursuing future vehicle alternatives to produce at Michigan Assembly and will discuss this issue with UAW leadership as part of the upcoming negotiations,\" spokeswoman Kristina Adamski said Wednesday in a statement. The UAW opened contract talks with all three Detroit-area automakers last month. The contracts expire Sept. 14. In the 1990s, Americans bought more than 1 million small pickups every year, attracted by their lower prices, reasonable gas mileage and ability to haul light loads. Sales tumbled when bigger pickups, such as the Ford F-150, caught up in fuel economy. Ford got out of the small pickup market in the U.S. in 2011, followed by General Motors in 2012. But GM has returned to the market, selling nearly 88,000 Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon models this year. Through July, small pickup sales are up 62 percent to more than 211,000, according to Autodata Corp. The smaller trucks, which are more efficient that full-size pickups, could help GM and Ford meet government fuel economy requirements. New light vehicles must average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 under the standards. Ford says it's negotiating on a vehicle for the Wayne plant but wouldn't talk about future products.",

            "article_content": "Reaction from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel \u201cThere is nothing new under the sun. But there are lots of old things we don't know.\u201d \u2013 Ambrose Bierce We\u2019ve seen this all before. Everyone is apoplectic about how crazy the presidential campaign is. How crazy the congressional campaigns are. And then the dramatic FBI email news just days before the election. Did you hear about Mike Pence\u2019s plane sliding off the runway at LaGuardia? Can you believe it? What would have happened if\u2026 Chill. In an election year, October is always full of surprises. This isn\u2019t new. This zany stuff always unfolds in October just as the election cycle crescendos. Let\u2019s start with the Pence plane mishap\u2026 Late-House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, D-La., \u00a0and Rep. Nick Begich, D-Alaska, perished in a plane crash October 16, 1972. Nobody has ever found the plane after it lifted off from a socked-in Anchorage International Airport into turbulent skies. Boggs was in Alaska to help the freshman congressman campaign just before the election. Also on October 16 -- but 28 years later in 2000 -- Missouri Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan died in a Cessna that went down near St. Louis. Carnahan was running against then-Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. Missouri law prevented officials from striking Carnahan\u2019s name from the ballot. Carnahan still defeated Ashcroft posthumously by 2 percentage points. Missouri\u2019s new governor then appointed Carnahan\u2019s wife, Jean, to the Senate where she served until losing to former Sen. Jim Talent, a Republican, in a 2002 special election. Two years later, on October 25, 2002, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., barnstormed the state in his campaign against former Sen. Norm Coleman, a Republican. Wellstone died when the Beechcraft King Air A100 in which he was flying crashed in northern Minnesota. Then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, an Independent, appointed Sen. Dean Barkley, also an Independent, to serve the rest of Wellstone\u2019s term. Democrats scrambling to find a replacement for Wellstone on the ballot tapped former Democratic Vice President and former Sen. Walter Mondale. Coleman defeated Mondale a few days later. The term \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d entered the American political vernacular in 1964. That\u2019s when Washington, D.C., police picked up a top aide to President Lyndon Johnson on \u201cmorals\u201d charges after an incident in a YMCA locker room. Aide Walter Jenkins had worked with Johnson in the House dating back to the late-1930s, followed him to the Senate, the Kennedy administration, then the White House. Johnson thought his longtime aide was facing blackmail and that this could portend a \u201cdirty trick\u201d just before the election. The president got FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover on the phone immediately (remember the part about the FBI supposedly being above the fray just before elections we\u2019ve been hearing so much over the past few days?) to order an investigation. The president was just weeks away from facing Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Arizona, at the polls. Goldwater had long been talking about Texas cronyism and questions of ethics surrounding Lone Star State political operatives tied to Johnson. Goldwater\u2019s campaign printed bumper stickers declaring \u201cAll the Way with LBJ, but Don\u2019t Go Near the YMCA.\u201d In the New York Times, columnist James Reston wrote that the Jenkins bust \u201crevived and dramatized all the harsh feelings about morals, and political cliques, and the Texas gang in Washington.\u201d Sound familiar? \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d conspiracy theories only flourished after Jenkins\u2019s arrest. In October, 1968, rumors abounded that Johnson might craft a last-minute deal to halt the Vietnam War. Such an effort could vault Johnson\u2019s Vice President and Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey to the presidency over GOP nominee Richard Nixon. It was thought that President Carter might engineer a special deal with Iran in October, 1980, to trigger the release of American hostages held in Tehran. Of course, the converse theory was that the campaign of GOP nominee Ronald Reagan forged a pact for Tehran to hold the hostages through the election to make Carter appear weak. Iran freed the hostages on Reagan\u2019s inauguration day in 1981. Four days before the 1992 presidential election, the feds indicted former Reagan Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger over the Iran-Contra affair. This fueled speculation that then-President George. H.W. Bush knew something about the arms-for-hostages agreement. Republicans found the timing dubious. They charged this was an effort by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh to defeat Bush. President Bill Clinton then vanquished Bush with Ross Perot placing third. Bush pardoned Weinberger in the final days of his presidency. We haven\u2019t even talked about the election dispute in Florida in 2000 between President George W. Bush, a Republican, and Vice President Al Gore, a Republican. And that\u2019s to say nothing of a 1976 DUI arrest of the younger Bush in Maine, which surfaced immediately before the 2000 election. But almost no October Surprise resonated quite like the one in the closing days of the 2004 presidential campaign between George W. Bush and then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. A videotape -- recorded somewhere in the Hindu Kush mountains bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan -- surfaced on October 30, 2004. The public hadn\u2019t seen nor heard from Osama bin Laden for a while. But like an apparition appearing on Halloween, America\u2019s mortal enemy infused immediately into that year\u2019s presidential election. The tape rattled the country. Would the phantasm of bin Laden remind voters that the 9-11 attacks unfolded on President Bush\u2019s watch? Would it rekindle the fears of terrorism and perhaps work against Kerry? Kerry\u2019s surrogates wondered aloud why the U.S. had still not captured bin Laden. Just months before, Kerry assumed the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Boston to accept his party\u2019s presidential nod. \u201cI\u2019m John Kerry and I\u2019m reporting for duty,\u201d declared the former Vietnam-era soldier, saluting the throng. The bin Laden video almost echoed Kerry\u2019s pronouncement, but with a vengeful sneer. It practically proclaimed \u201cI\u2019m Osama bin Laden and I\u2019m reporting for duty.\u201d In the video, a robust-looking bin Laden stared directly into the camera and augured that neither Bush nor Kerry held the keys to U.S. security. \u201cI am speaking to tell you about the ideal way to avoid another Manhattan,\u201d threatened bin Laden. \u201cYour security is in your own hands.\u201d And so now we have another October Surprise, courtesy of FBI Director James Comey and \u201cCarlos Danger,\u201d the nom de plum of former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y. Comey cleared Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing tied to her email back in July. Republicans went nuts, accusing Comey of politics. Naturally, Democrats were grateful. \u201cLet me just say this about Director Comey,\u201d beamed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in July. \u201cThis is a great man. We are very privileged in our country to have him be the director of the FBI.\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a Californian and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel, gushed with similar praise for the nation\u2019s top G-Man. \u201cI\u2019m especially grateful to the FBI and Director Comey -- who previously served as a U.S. attorney and deputy attorney general during the Bush administration -- for a thorough, objective review,\u201d Feinstein said at the time. But Friday\u2019s news muted the Pelosi and Feinstein\u2019s praise for Comey, as Republicans rallied to his cause. \u201cThe public interest would be served by the FBI providing the facts, rather than allowing Republicans to stoke innuendo and falsehoods 11 days away from a presidential election,\u201d Pelosi said. Feinstein said she was \u201cshocked\u201d to read Comey\u2019s missive Friday and called the move \u201cappalling.\u201d \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s announcement played right into the political campaign of Donald Trump, who is already using the letter for political purposes,\u201d she said. There are just a few hours left in October. Not a lot of time left for surprises. It\u2019s just that these things happen all the time in October. And they sometimes trigger other events in November. That\u2019s when the real surprises happen.",

            "article_content": "A boy stands in the rain in front of makeshift tents at a homeless encampment in the Kakaako district of Honolulu. (AP) HONOLULU \u2013 Two days before the city planned to dismantle her sidewalk home, Kionina Kaneso had no idea where she and her daughter and grandchildren would sleep. A full-time fast-food worker, Kaneso had bad experiences at shelters before and was hesitant to live in another, ending up instead in one of the nation's largest homeless encampments for two years. Desperate, she decided to try to get into a shelter. Kaneso, a daughter and granddaughter made the long walk to one from their camp in a neighborhood between downtown Honolulu's high-rises, the swaying palm trees of a beachfront park and the glittering tourist mecca of Waikiki. \"This is a multi-million dollar view, and it's free\" A shelter worker helped several people from the camp find a spot inside to live. She wasn't as lucky: There was no more space for families. \"Where can I go?\" Kaneso asked. ___ Homelessness in Hawaii has grown in recent years, leaving the state with 487 homeless per 100,000 people, the nation's highest rate per capita, ahead of New York and Nevada, according to federal statistics. A homeless man drinks water while sitting on the beach at Ala Moana Beach Park located near Waikiki in Honolulu. (AP) Since 2010, the rise has come even as the national rate has fallen during the economic recovery. The increase, driven by years of rising costs in the island chain, low wages and limited land, thrust the image of people sleeping on beaches alongside the state's famed one of a relaxing tropical paradise. Officials have tried to solve the problem, which is centered on Oahu, the most populated island. They've offered homeless services, banned sitting and lying on Waikiki's sidewalks and proposed using shipping containers as temporary housing. Gov. David Ige's declaration of a state of emergency on homelessness underscored the depth of the crisis: \u2014 While there are shelters and programs to help the homeless, there are far fewer empty beds than are needed \u2014 about 550 on any given night in Oahu, where an estimated 4,900 of the 7,620 homeless people live, according to service providers. \u2014 The state needs 27,000 affordable rental units by 2020, but lawmakers set aside enough money for 800 units this year. Maintaining the existing public housing could cost $800 million over the next decade, according to state estimates. \u2014 Statewide, 10,000 people wait five years or more to get into state-run public housing, and the waiting list for Section 8 rent assistance in private housing was so long, they closed the list for about a decade. \u2014 The state's population of unsheltered families ballooned 46 percent from 2014 to 2015, said Scott Morishige, state coordinator on homelessness. He said changes in public housing policy and mental health services contributed to the rise. A survey by service providers in August of Kaneso's encampment found that 42 percent of the nearly 300 people were families. ___ After being told there was no space for her family, Kaneso went through with the application anyway, hoping that a slot would open up. Her daughter, Kifency Kinney, 24, had to apply separately because she was an adult. This didn't make sense to Kaneso, who says children stay with their parents long past age 18 back home, the Pacific island state of Chuuk in Micronesia. Kionina Kaneso, left, pushes carts of laundry followed by her granddaughter, Keioleen Helly, center, and daughter, Kifency Kinny, past the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine near a tent in a homeless encampment in which they lived in Honolulu. (AP) \"What's she gonna do? She doesn't have a job,\" Kaneso told the shelter worker. On the way back to their tent, Kaneso and her daughter pushed shopping carts full of laundry they did while waiting at the shelter. Keioleen Helly, 3, pushed a stroller with the laundry detergent. Soon, they ran into outreach workers who told them about how buses would take the camp's residents to shelters. Kaneso and her daughter then began packing baby oil, a football, chips and clothes into boxes and plastic bins, and called a friend with a truck to help them get their belongings to a storage unit. She had one more day to figure out what to do with everything that didn't fit into the truck, and where her family would go. ___ Kaneso's encampment, known as Kakaako, wasn't the only one in Hawaii. Hundreds live in another on western Oahu that's existed for more than a decade. A strip of waterfront tent sites with the best view is known as \"the Hilton.\" Connie \"Tita\" Hokoana, who has lived in the encampment for seven years, sat on a lava rock as waves splashed over her body. \"This is a multi-million dollar view, and it's free,\" said Hokoana, who had set out a bunch of foraged wild kiawe beans to dry, planning to make tea or peanut butter bars to sell for extra cash. \"I choose to live like this,\" she said. Few, however, come to Hawaii imagining living in a makeshift tent. Kaneso arrived in 2004 and worked odd jobs as a dishwasher and assembly line worker to pay for her son's flight to Hawaii so he could get medical treatment for a heart condition. Kaneso is among the many Micronesians who moved to Hawaii in recent years as part of an agreement their nations have with the U.S. government that allows them to work and live in the country. They come for medical care, education and job opportunities. ___ The pressure on homeless services has caused some resentment. While the state doesn't have a break down by race of the overall homeless population, data on homeless shelter use show that 30 percent were Hawaiian or part-Hawaiian; 27 percent Micronesian, Marshallese or other Pacific Islanders; and 26 percent white. On Kaneso's block, most of her neighbors were Chuukese, drawn together by language and a desire to look out for each other. They shared blankets and food and loaned each other money. Farther down the street, an American Samoan father with diabetes ran a shop out of his tent, using the cash to buy fuel for a generator. On another, a Native Hawaiian ex-convict and airport shuttle driver organized a dishwashing station. Micronesians say they face language barriers and discrimination. \"It's both blatant and subtle,\" said Kandhi Elieisar, consul general for the Federated States of Micronesia, who said he faced prejudice when he looked for an apartment in Hawaii. Native Hawaiians, some of whom see the U.S. government as an occupier since a group of mainlanders overthrew the queen and took over their land, have long grappled with challenges of their own, from high incarceration rates to health disparities. To some, the influx of other Pacific Islanders using services adds insult to injury. \"Everything's pretty much getting stripped away from us,\" said Deja-Lynn Rombawa-Quarles, a Native Hawaiian who lived in the Kakaako encampment and worked at an after-school program. Rombawa-Quarles kept a worn copy of King Kamehameha's \"law of the splintered paddle,\" which states that Hawaiians are allowed to lie down by the road. She said Native Hawaiians should be helped first \"because we really are suffering.\" \"There's no aloha anymore in Hawaii,\" she said. ___ As homeless numbers rose in the 2000s, Ala Moana Beach Park, not far from Waikiki, became crowded. The city tried to create a temporary safe zone in 2006 where the homeless could camp legally, but more complaints ensued, so it ended up closing the park every night. Many of the homeless moved into hotel garages and walkways near Waikiki Beach. Then the city banned sitting and lying down on sidewalks, a move backed by the Hyatt Regency, Hilton Worldwide and other major resorts, which generate much of Waikiki's $6.8 billion in annual tourism revenue, nearly half of all visitor spending in Hawaii. The hotels saw fewer homeless people, who then moved into other neighborhoods, prompting more complaints. \"People cannot camp and take over parts of our city and state property that has been built and designed for everyone, not one specific group,\" said Mayor Kirk Caldwell, after a group meeting on homelessness in September. \"It's not safe.\" Honolulu spends $15,000 a week to sweep away the camps. During the sweeps, families lost possessions like the wood they use to build their structures, found furniture and clothes. Kaneso's family, for example, lost food, propane stoves and her grandchildren's toys in a raid last year. \"They just treat us like animals,\" said Kaneso, who is now part of a lawsuit against the sweeps. ___ A week after a sweep last year, Kaneso's boyfriend rebuilt the family home not far from the spot where it had been, on a sidewalk near public bathrooms and laundry facilities and a bus stop where she could catch a ride to work. An 18-foot, two-room makeshift structure was supported by a chain-link fence on one side and a tree on another, buttressed by two-by-fours, cardboard, poles, tarps and vinyl banners discarded by the nearby Volvo dealership. She filled buckets that once held restaurant-sized quantities of soy sauce and ice cream with clean water to wash her dishes and bathe her grandchildren. One bucket served as a toilet at night when the public bathrooms at a beach park were closed. Kaneso did her best to keep their home clean, removing her shoes before going inside and sweeping morning and night. From there, she headed to work each morning, catching a bus that climbs into the Koolau mountains, passing lush forests and waterfalls, to McDonald's where she works. One evening, with extra burgers in hand, she waited for nearly 40 minutes for her bus. As light rain fell, buses carrying tourists whizzed past, on their way to Waikiki. ___ Service providers say 40 percent of Hawaii's homeless people are working at least part-time, 30 percent need some housing assistance and 30 percent have mental health or substance abuse problems that prevent them from maintaining a home. For Kaneso, the month had been tough financially: She helped pay for a cousin's hospital stay and contributed money for the funeral of her 16-year-old nephew. Her family in Chuuk was asking her to send money for fuel and food. And she still needed to pay for propane for herself and her neighbors, and was running out of rice and water. Kaneso's job nets her $8.75 an hour, but it doesn't come close to what she needs to pay rent in a market where a two-bedroom apartment goes for $1,800 a month. Honolulu officials have set aside at least $16.8 million for services and to secure apartments for homeless people in 2015, including plans to develop units out of shipping containers to temporarily house transients on Sand Island and the Waianae Coast. City officials also are backing at least $32 million in bonds to finance other housing for homeless people. Meanwhile, the Public Housing Authority has been cracking down on people living in its units with friends or family who were not on the lease, said Connie Mitchell, director of the Institute for Human Services, the state's largest homeless services provider. With no place else to go, many wound up on the street. ___ Kaneso, who lived with a sister in public housing but left because she didn't want to get her in trouble, has been on a waiting list for Section 8 assistance since 2006, and found out she made it to the top 250 last year. In September, after violent incidents raised the profile of Kaneso's encampment, city and state officials began gradually clearing tents again; this time giving plenty of warning, hoping people would voluntarily leave. Kaneso had left a shelter for the streets after workers during one stay threw away her belongings, including her birth certificate and passport, while she was out visiting her son. As evening fell the day before the sweep, Kaneso, despite her worries, laughed as a cousin stopped by with rice to share. \"I love my house,\" Kaneso said wistfully, before settling down to the sounds of neighbors' hip hop music and occasional shouts. ___ On the morning of the sweep, crews began clearing sidewalks and a city bus waited to take willing people to shelters. Keioleen played on a pink Disney Magic scooter while Chuukese families gathered at picnic tables in a nearby park under the trees, bringing shopping carts and strollers laden with suitcases and plastic bags. Suddenly, sprinklers turned on, sending them scrambling with their belongings. Officials said they couldn't stay there. Kaneso relied on strangers to move her belongings to storage, and then, after hours of uncertainty, she and her family got into a shelter. But she didn't want to stay there for long; shelter rules prevented her from cooking for her family, and it was challenging for extended family to visit to provide childcare for her grandchildren while she was at work. But the alternatives were scant. She's one of thousands of people on the public housing waiting list. \"What is the use for us, to keep telling us to wait this long?\" Kaneso said.",

            "article_content": "In March of 1968, Captain Paul Army Capt. Paul \u201cBuddy\u201d Bucha faked out the enemy while leading a motley crew in Vietnam. The Medal of Honor recipient was hailed as a hero after he made North Vietnamese fighters believe his 187th Infantry Regiment was much bigger than it really was. The combination of bravery and cunning helped him earn the nation's highest military honor, an award bestowed upon him by the president. In 1967, Bucha \u2014 who graduated from West Point and earned an MBA at Stanford \u2014 arrived in Vietnam and was given a squad filled \u201cwith the rejects of all the other units,\u201d including writers, intellectuals and men who had served time in military prison, he said. \u201cWe were called the 'clerks and the jerks,'\" he recalled. \"We were a few smart guys and a lot of badasses \u2026 considered the losers of all losers.\u201d But as a company commander new to Vietnam, \"I, too, was a loser,\u201d Bucha recalled fondly years later. \u201cSo we were sort of meant for each other.\u201d \"They ended up being a very disciplined, proud, and frightening force,\" he said. On March 16, 1968, soon after the Tet Offensive, Bucha's 89-man company took part in a counterattack designed to push the North Vietnamese away from Saigon. A helicopter dropped his team into an enemy stronghold, and for two days they destroyed camps and fortifications. On March 18, after they found a clearing and resupplied, Bucha directed his troops to push into the jungle, where it was getting dark. A soldier spotted a group of Vietnamese water carriers and women, which usually indicated an established enemy location. Bucha gave him permission to fire a few rounds to test what was out there. \"The entire mountain returned fire\u2026. I said, 'Oh, my God,'\" Bucha recalled. An entire North Vietnamese Army battalion hit Bucha's unit with heavy machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and claymore mines, pinning down the lead group of 12 Americans. The Viet Cong had a machine gunner at ground level and a fighter with an automatic weapon up in a tree, and \"I figured the easiest thing to do was to just blow the tree up,\u201d Bucha said. \"I just \u2026 started throwing hand grenades,\" he said. \"When the weapons stopped, I looked around and no one was firing at me. There was a calm, and I\u2019m not sure if the calm was in my mind or if it was actual calm.\" Bucha ordered his troops to withdraw to a more defensible position, and for the next several hours they were in a fierce firefight. He feared his group would be overrun, and a dark thought crept into his mind: \"What a hellhole to die in.\" (Earl Van Alstine/U.S. Army) He decided to give every soldier a number, and when he called out a number over the radio, the soldier who\u2019d been assigned that number would throw grenades from his position, giving the illusion of a much bigger force. An Australian pilot came over the radio and offered to drop two 750-pound bombs, and Bucha asked him to level a couple of nearby hills. He did, and the bombs rocked the soldiers. \"We bounced \u2026 and when I turned around, my men were all laughing, and I started laughing, and we realized we're not in this alone,\" he said. \"[I thought] we might make it.\" A U.S. helicopter finally arrived, and Bucha directed the evacuation of the wounded. When the enemy withdrew the next morning, he learned that his team had killed more than 150 North Vietnamese. But 10 Americans in his platoon had also died. When he learned he would receive the Medal of Honor, Bucha told a sergeant, \"I don't deserve it.\" But the sergeant convinced him he would wear the medal on behalf of his men, and on May 14, 1970, Bucha accepted the award from President Richard Nixon. Still, Bucha said, \"Every day of my life, I think back to what I could have done better that night \u2026 to bring those 10 [Americans] home.\" Today, Bucha makes speeches to military groups, including at his alma mater, West Point. \"I try to go somewhere one day a week, 52 times a year, to where troops are.\u2026 When I see them and listen to them, I come away grateful \u2026 for the privilege to be among them,\" he said.

            "article_content": "FILE - In this June 3, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures to a his camouflaged \"Make America Great\" hat at a campaign rally at the Redding Municipal Airport in Redding, Calif.  Trump's prediction that he can win California in the November presidential election challenges the dismal history for Republican nominees in one of the nation's Democratic strongholds. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 Donald Trump says the United States admits Syrian refugees without checking their backgrounds and that Hillary Clinton wants to allow \"radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country.\" Neither is so, part of a pattern of exaggeration that strains the credibility of his argument since the Orlando nightclub shooting that the U.S. faces apocalyptic danger from Muslim immigrants. Trump's rhetoric has been slashing, polarizing, passionate and at times illogical. He confuses immigrants with refugees and overlooks the fact some extremists are U.S. citizens. He speaks as if the U.S. border is a gate wide open. And his numbers are off. It's a given that hyperbole comes with Trump territory. He's acknowledged that exaggeration for dramatic effect is part of how he rolls. It's how he connects at a gut level with supporters who look past mangled facts to what they see as a larger truth, while opponents stand back aghast. Altogether, the Orlando massacre by a U.S. citizen with Islamist beliefs, radical sympathies and an apparently tortured psyche has reignited a tangle of debates on domestic terrorism, threats from abroad, the nation's refugee traditions, hate crimes and guns in the early days of the Trump-Clinton general election campaign. A look at some of Trump's recent statements on those issues and how they compare with the facts: ___ TRUMP: \"We are taking in thousands of people into our country. We have no idea where they come from, we have no idea who the hell they are. We know they believe in certain things that we don't want to believe in.\" THE FACTS: It's not true that the government knows nothing about refugees who come to the United States. The State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration keeps detailed records about how many refugees arrive monthly, and from where. The information is available to the public online through the agency's Refugee Processing Center (www.wrapsnet.org). The arrival information is broken down by country and region. In May, for example, 6,511 refugees were resettled in the United States. The Democratic Republic of the Congo had the largest number of refugees who arrived last month, 1,274. Annual data about immigrants is also available from the government through the Homeland Security Department's Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. Would-be immigrants and refugees are screened to ensure they haven't been identified by intelligence agencies or law enforcement as having ties to terrorist organizations or criminal records. But people's belief systems are not generally considered as part of their applications to move to the United States. ___ TRUMP: \"And yet you see this great migration, which is a horrible thing to watch.\" THE FACTS: Trump is right that there is a mass migration taking place from Syria and other countries in the Middle East. Millions of people are thought to have fled. But he's wrong to imply that the huge influx has come into the United States. Since 2011, about 5,760 Syrian refugees have been brought to the U.S. As of the end of May, 41,424 refugees from around the world have come to the United States since the start of the budget year in October. According to the State Department, 14,898 of those people are from the \"Near East/South Asia\" region, which includes Syria. But only 2,805 Syrians were among them. As a whole, African nations have accounted for more refugees and Myanmar (also known as Burma) leads all countries, with 8,112 refugees, in the first eight months of the current budget year. According to the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, more than 1 million Syrians have sought refuge in Europe since 2011. That's the \"great migration.\" ___ TRUMP: \"Now she (Clinton) wants to allow them to come into our country pretty much unvetted because every law enforcement person that I've spoken to and that you watched and that you read is saying it's very hard, if not impossible, to check out people. There are just no papers. There are no papers. And yet you see this great migration.\" \"Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them or to prevent the radicalization of their children. \"Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country \u2014 they enslave women and murder gays.\" THE FACTS: That's not what Clinton has said. The presumptive Democratic nominee says she wants to \"begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.\" Clinton proposes that the United States accept as many as 65,000 people from Syria, compared with President Barack Obama's plans to resettle 10,000 people from that country this year. She has never suggested that she would scale back the refugee processing system as it exists today. Late last year, the Obama administration for the first time disclosed details about how refugees are investigated. Officials described a drawn-out process that includes in-person interviews overseas and involves multiple agencies, led by Homeland Security. Refugees must submit to interviews before they can come, and provide biographical details about themselves \u2014 their families, friendships, social or political activities, employment, telephone numbers, email accounts and more. They also provide biometric information, including fingerprints. Syrians are subject to additional, classified controls that officials have declined to describe specifically. Refugee processing generally takes 18 months to 24 months. It can be longer for Syrians. While Trump is wrong to say Syrian refugees undergo no screening or practically none, that's not to say the system is foolproof. Contrary to Trump's assertion that \"there are no papers,\" refugee applicants must provide documentation. But the administration has acknowledged it can be difficult to verify the accuracy or authenticity of documents provided by refugee applicants against foreign government records from countries that don't cooperate with the U.S. government, such as Syria. It can be tough for the U.S. to check foreign government records for local arrests or lesser bureaucratic interactions, such as bank records, business licenses or civil filings. Refugees from Syria in particular tend to provide extensive documents involving their day-to-day lives. They often have family histories, military records and other information that can be useful for American authorities investigating them. ___ TRUMP: \"We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.\" THE FACTS: Trump may be right on his overall description of the U.S. immigration system as \"dysfunctional.\" It's demonstrably false to say the U.S. doesn't know who is being allowed into the country. Illegal immigration along the Mexican border remains a problem. Tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and people traveling as families, mostly from Central America, have arrived at the U.S. border this year. The U.S. still lacks a comprehensive exit system to determine more effectively who has stayed in the country after their visas have expired. But the U.S. government obviously knows who receives the government's permission to legally immigrate into the country. Would-be immigrants, refugees and foreign tourists are all subjected to background checks and various forms of screening. In the case of tourists, people from 38 countries approved for the Visa Waiver Program must submit biographic and other data about themselves before they can legally travel to the United States using the online Electronic System for Travel. People from the approved countries who are also citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria or who have traveled in those countries since March 2011 are generally not eligible to use the visa-free travel program. Tourists from all other countries have to apply for visas and submit to interviews, as well as other vetting.",

            "article_content": "Missouri lawmaker weighs in Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jason Kander conceded early Wednesday, ending his spirited bid to unseat incumbent Republican Roy Blunt in a race both parties had eyed as potentially pivotal in the battle over control of the chamber. Blunt, 66, served seven terms in the House before winning election to the Senate in 2010. He'd never faced a close race before, but polls showed this election was tight from the outset as Kander, Missouri's 35-year-old secretary of state and a former Army intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, emerged as one of the surprise candidates in any Senate race. In a short concession speech, Kander urged people of his generation to stick with politics despite the somber election results. \"They need to know that I'm not OK with them stepping away, that this country is a place you've got to stay invested in,\" Kander told supporters in Kansas City. \"This generation is not going anywhere.\" Blunt relished a hard-fought victory. \"What a great moment for our state,\" he told supporters in Springfield, soon after receiving a concession call from Kander. Blunt dominated the rural areas of the state, offsetting Kander's advantage in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. His win was part of a GOP sweep in Missouri in statewide offices mostly dominated previously by Democrats. Republicans also won races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer. National senatorial committees for both parties and a wide array of political action committees and other groups combined to spend millions of dollars on the Missouri race, which some thought might decide control of the Senate. Kander ran on the need for a new generation of leadership, often seeking to portray Blunt as a Washington insider with a wife and three children who are lobbyists. The message resonated with many voters, including Jim Moore, 75, a retired management consultant from Chesterfield who said he voted for Kander because \"we need to have a new voice in Washington representing Missouri.\" But Mary Beck, a 61-year-old assistant nursing professor from Columbia, said she voted for Blunt because of his experience. She said it takes time to \"have influence and to understand how to work with the other players at the U.S. Capitol.\" Kander spent the campaign playing up his military experience, most notably with a TV ad showing him putting together an assault rifle while blindfolded and daring Blunt to do the same. Blunt campaigned on such core believes as a need for more and better jobs and the elimination of unnecessary regulations and the Affordable Care Act. He also criticized Kander's handling of election problems as secretary of state, including a ballot shortage at some St. Louis County precincts in the April election and a state legislative primary in St. Louis city in August that had to be redone because of absentee ballot concerns. Blunt was elected Missouri secretary of state in 1984 and re-elected four years later. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1992, he was elected to the House in 1996 and re-elected six times, winning by wide majorities each time. He was House Majority Whip from 2003 to 2007. He defeated Democrat Robin Carnahan by a 54 percent to 41 percent vote in 2010 to win a seat in the Senate. Kander served two terms in the Missouri House before winning election as secretary of state in 2012. What happens next for him isn't clear: The next senatorial election in Missouri is in 2018, but the incumbent is a fellow Democrat, Claire McCaskill.",

            "article_content": "Senior adviser talks shift to general election strategy as presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump pivoted Wednesday to an expected general election brawl with Hillary Clinton, as he watched the political bramble in his path to the Republican nomination clear away entirely \u2013 with last remaining rival John Kasich joining Ted Cruz in suspending his campaign. The Ohio governor dropped out of the race Wednesday afternoon. Trump, now the presumptive nominee and no longer facing the prospect of a bruising open convention, has effectively crushed any lingering bids to halt his outsider primary campaign, which has defied the odds and political convention ever since his entry into the race less than a year ago. Trump turns next to the weighty task of uniting a fractured party and told Fox News Wednesday morning he plans to focus on November. \u201cWe\u2019re going to unify the party,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d The coming weeks will test Trump as he recalibrates his campaign \u2013 and potentially his tone \u2013 in preparation for that fight. While one recent poll gave him the edge over Clinton, most have shown Trump trailing her in hypothetical general election match-ups. He told Fox News he\u2019s building up staff and vetting potential running mates as he prepares for November. \u201cI\u2019m considering a lot of people [for running mate], to be honest,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWe want to have great at every level.\u201d In a shift, Trump also said he \u201cmost likely\u201d will look to raise money for the general election, though he said it would be more for the party and congressional candidates than for himself. Such a move could help ease tensions with other wings of the party, whose leaders have been sharply divided over Trump's rise since the beginning. Trump also told The New York Times that his VP selection committee will include former rival Ben Carson. Kasich and Cruz\u2019s decision to suspend their campaigns following a crushing defeat in Indiana allows Trump to leave the raucous primary behind as he looks ahead. Kasich\u2019s campaign initially said the Ohio governor would remain in the race until a candidate reaches the necessary 1,237 delegates, but reversed course Wednesday. With Cruz and Kasich now ending their bids, Trump would appear on a glide path to hitting that mark, having vanquished everyone in what was once a 17-person field \u2013 and now within easy reach of the party mantle, an outcome some pundits and power-brokers once refused to even contemplate. Cruz announced his decision to dismayed supporters in Indianapolis. \u201cI said I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory. Tonight, I\u2019m sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed,\u201d Cruz said. While a Trump-Clinton match-up now appears inevitable, Sen. Bernie Sanders kept the race alive on the Democratic side Tuesday night by pulling off a projected upset victory in Indiana. \u201cI understand that Secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over,\u201d Sanders said, adding that he has \u201cbad news\u201d for her. But on the GOP side, while Trump still could face drama at the party convention in Cleveland, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus declared him the \"presumptive\" nominee Tuesday night, as did Clinton. Trump addressed supporters at Trump Tower Tuesday night after his seventh consecutive victory, in Indiana. He called Cruz \"one hell of a competitor,\" calling his decision to drop out of the race \"brave.\" He also said that while he wasn't sure if Cruz likes him, he praised his former rival as a \"smart\" and \"tough guy\" who had an \"amazing future\" ahead of him. Trump then turned his attention to his likely Democratic opponent, saying, \u201cWe're going after Hillary Clinton.\" The New York billionaire criticized Clinton's recent comments about the coal industry. He says she wants to close mines and he promised to help coal miners get back to work. Cruz campaigned aggressively in Indiana, but could not overcome Trump. \u201cWith a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign. \u2026 But hear me now, I am not suspending our fight for liberty,\" Cruz said. Fox News projected Trump has the winner shortly after the polls closed at 7 p.m. ET. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Trump has 53.3 percent of the vote. Tuesday\u2019s primary capped off a bitter and personal clash between Trump and Cruz with each accusing the other of being an unhinged liar. As soon as the race was called, Trump demanded Cruz exit the primary race, tweeting that \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d should \u201cstop wasting time & money.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump rehashed claims on Fox News that Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael Cruz, appeared in a 1963 photograph with John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald -- citing a report first published by the National Enquirer. \"His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot,\" Trump said on Fox & Friends. \"Nobody even brings it up; I mean they don't even talk about that.\" Responding, Cruz called his father his \"hero,\" and labeled Trump an \"amoral\" liar. He also described Trump as a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon.\u201d Cruz went into the Indiana primary vowing to fight on even if he lost. The Associated Press now has Trump leading the delegate count with 1,047. Cruz suspended his campaign with 565. Kasich still has 153. To secure the Republican nomination, a candidate must have 1,237 delegates. According to the Associated Press delegate count, Clinton now has 2,202 delegates compared with Sanders\u2019 1,400. A Democratic candidate needs 2,383 delegates to get the party\u2019s nomination. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee addresses supporters in Virginia Beach, Virginia Donald Trump, in the wake of last week\u2019s deadly attack on Dallas police and a fresh wave of protests over police-involved shootings, voiced his full-throated support Monday for America\u2019s law enforcement and declared himself the \u201claw and order candidate.\u201d The presumptive Republican presidential nominee put himself foursquare behind police at a combustible time in the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Speaking at an address in Virginia Beach originally billed as a veterans policy speech, Trump opened by discussing the deep challenges police face. \u201cWe will always stand with you,\u201d Trump said. He compared the atmosphere to the hostility veterans faced after the Vietnam War, and called for that \u201chostility\u201d to \u201cend immediately, right now.\u201d He said inner-cities are \u201crife with crime\u201d and efforts to curtail law enforcement are \u201churting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.\u201d He then used the issue to draw a distinction between him and his presumptive presidential rival. \u201cWe must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country. \u2026 I am the law and order candidate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering and as proven by her recent email scandal \u2026 she\u2019s either a liar or grossly incompetent.\u201d Clinton -- who is looking to move beyond the email issue after the Justice Department decided not to pursue charges, and has defended her actions -- has voiced support as well for law enforcement in the wake of the Dallas murders. She spoke with the Dallas mayor after the shooting last week, and on Friday said the country must not vilify police officers. \u201cWhat happened in Dallas, what's happening to other police officers in our country is absolutely outrageous,\u201d she told PBS on Friday. \u201cWe have got to do much more to protect and respect the police.\u201d At the same time, she said, \u201cWe have to do much more to make sure that citizens in our country, particularly African-Americans, feel respected and protected by the police.\u201d The political arena has indeed been seized by a complex debate over law enforcement, crime and racial bias. On one hand, the killing of black men by police officers has not only fueled movements like Black Lives Matter but brought the criminal justice debate to the fore of the congressional and presidential campaigns. New protests, including the one that preceded the Dallas shooting, broke out after two black men were killed last week by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. At the same time, dozens of officers have been killed in the line of duty so far this year. The Dallas attack, in which five officers died, was the deadliest for law enforcement since 9/11. Taken together, the violence has fueled concerns that officers are not getting the support they need from their communities and political leaders. Meanwhile, Trump was pushing his plan Monday for cracking down on Veterans Affairs employees who fail to serve veterans. His 10-point plan would expand programs allowing veterans to seek government-funded private medical care. Trump also says he will fire or discipline VA employees who \"fail our veterans\" or breach the public trust. Trump has been working to repair his relationship with veterans since he suggested early in his campaign that Sen. John McCain was not a war hero because he was captured during the Vietnam War. Helping veterans, though, has long been a staple of Trump's campaign. And he hammered the Obama administration for the 2014 Veterans Affairs scandal over long wait times for veterans seeking medical care and falsified records by VA employees to cover up the delays. The presumptive GOP nominee spoke in Virginia Beach, Va., not far from the USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, where he first unveiled his plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs last October. Then he promised to modernize the system, minimize wait times for patients and improve care. \"The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,\" read the plan that Trump unveiled last fall. \"The guiding principle of the Trump plan is ensuring veterans have convenient access to the best quality care.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Final national poll before voters cast their ballots revealed on 'America's Newsroom' Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton barnstormed the country on election eve Monday to deliver their respective closing arguments before the raucous 2016 presidential race goes to the voters, with Trump vowing to make America safe and prosperous again and Clinton vowing to unite a divided nation. \u201cAnger is not a plan,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said in Pittsburgh, Pa. President Obama said Monday night that voters don't have to settle for just voting against Donald Trump. He told a crowd of over 20,000 in front of Independence Hall they \"have somebody extraordinary to vote for\" in Clinton. Obama delivered his closing pitch for Clinton during a star-studded rally in Philadelphia while trying to combat the notion that voters have to settle for Clinton because they're so turned off by Trump. While Obama said he's had to \"bite my tongue\" throughout the \"nonsense\" of the campaign, he hit back at \"vicious, crazy\" attacks against Clinton and said she's been held to double-standards. As Clinton spent the day blasting what she called her opponent\u2019s \u201cdivisive vision\u201d for America, Trump blamed her and her husband\u2019s policies for manufacturing job losses and vowed a change if he\u2019s elected. \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you. We\u2019re going to bring back wealth taken from this country,\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, said in battleground state North Carolina, the second of his five stops Monday. Trump began his day in Florida before heading to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He pulled out all the stops at the second to last rally of his campaign in Manchester, New Hampshire. Trump appeared with his running mate Mike Pence and many members of his family at the SNHU Arena, the same arena where he held his final rally before the New Hampshire primary. His win in that race paved his way to the party's nomination. \"It all began for me in New Hampshire,\" Trump said after taking the stage. The race remains tight hours before voting gets underway. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows Trump\u2019s prospects improving in four key states -- Arizona, Iowa, Utah and North Carolina \u2013 though Clinton still has the advantage on the electoral map. Clinton returned to the campaign trail Monday, less than 24 hours after the FBI concluded a revived probe into her personal email use as secretary of state, lifting a cloud off her campaign in the final hours as she seeks to become the first woman elected president in U.S. history. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time,\u201d Clinton said at her first rally, in Pittsburgh. \u201cWill we come together as a nation or split further apart? \u2026 We don\u2019t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive big-hearted America.\u201d Before embarking on her three-state campaign swing, Clinton told reporters that she has \"some work to do to bring the country together\" and that she wants to be president for those who vote for her and those who don't. Clinton after Pennsylvania went to battleground state Michigan before planning to return for an event in Philadelphia, then a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Trump on Monday resumed his breakneck race through the country to make a final appeal to voters to help him \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. In the wake of the FBI announcement, he urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box.\" On Sunday, Trump and running mate Mike Pence held events in seven states, with the last starting after midnight in Virginia. \u201cShe wants to fight ISIS?\u201d Trump said Monday in North Carolina about Clinton, who has essentially led for the entire 2016 election cycle. \u201cShe wants to fight nobody. She\u2019s got no chance.\u201d Trump is aiming for an upset victory Tuesday, which is still possible if he is able to win key toss-up states and pick off one or more strategic states considered Democratic territory. The former reality TV star shocked the country\u2019s political class this spring when he defeated 16 major candidates in the Republican primaries, among them several senators and governors. While seeking victories in the so-called battleground states, which have a mix of voters who could go for either major party candidate, Pennsylvania is considered critical for Trump. The state has not elected a GOP presidential nominee since 1988 in the candidates\u2019 race to get 270 Electoral College votes. Trump still expressed optimism Monday about winning Pennsylvania. \u201cAre you watching what\u2019s happening in Philadelphia?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cWe are going to win.\u201d The public transit system in liberal-leaning Philadelphia will be running in time for Election Day, after a weeklong strike, which is good news for Clinton and other Democratic candidates on Tuesday's ballots. City officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. Early voting in other battleground states suggests Clinton is leading among Hispanics, a key voting bloc. However, the African-American vote does not appear as strong for her as it was in 2008 and 2012 when black voters helped elect and re-elect Barack Obama. The Justice Department said Monday that it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That's a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago, amid Trump\u2019s persistent warning about potential voter fraud at polling stations. Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. The announcement also came amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show that the staff has not stopped Trump from tweeting despite a report suggesting otherwise. Many of Trump\u2019s most inflammatory comments during the campaign were made on Twitter. But he has exhibited unusual restraint on social media in the final days of the campaign. After days of attacks on Trump's qualifications and temperament, Clinton this past weekend cast herself as the candidate of \"healing and reconciliation,\" despite being one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Overshadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI Director James Comey's latest letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.

            "article_content": "Julian Assange has promised a document dump on the Democrat nominee Julian Assange canceled a dramatic London balcony address on Tuesday in favor of a video presentation in Berlin after WikiLeaks developed \"specific information\" regarding Assange's safety, the leaked emails clearinghouse tweeted on Monday afternoon. Some believe the video announcement by the WikiLeaks founder could be an \"October surprise\" geared towards the U.S. presidential election.\u00a0Supporters of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump have said they believe the announcement will be damaging to the candidacy of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Tomorrow's press conf in Berlin proceeds. London speech by Assange has been moved to Berlin due to specific information. #wikileaks10 Assange, 45, who has lived in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for five years as officials in Sweden have sought him on criminal charges, is set to address supporters in Berlin via a video link at 3 a.m. ET. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give it away,\u201d Assange told Fox News Channel\u2019s Megyn Kelly in August, when he indicated he had a major scoop that could influence the race. \u201cBut it\u2019s a variety of documents, from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting, some even entertaining.\u201d In a subsequent interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity last month, Assange said his next round of revelations was coming \u201creasonably soon.\u201d \u201cThe first batch is reasonably soon,\u201d he told Hannity. \u201cWe are quite confident about it now.\u201d Assange has already played a key role in the presidential race, with the release of 20,000 internal emails that indicated the Democratic National Committee appeared to conspire to prevent Bernie Sanders from winning the nomination. Those revelations surfaced in August, just before the party\u2019s convention, proving embarrassing to Clinton\u2019s campaign. They also led to the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Hillary Clinton on Assange \"Can't we just drone this guy\"  -- report https://t.co/S7tPrl2QCZ pic.twitter.com/qy2EQBa48y Though no recent public revelations directly tie to Assange's security fears, various U.S. officials and pundits have made threatening statements directed at him in the past. WikiLeaks on Monday tweeted an alleged quote from a 2010 State Department meeting at which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked if Assange could be killed in a drone strike. That same year, former Democrat strategist Bob Beckel said on Fox News Channel that \"a dead man can't leak stuff.\" Assange also has hinted that deceased DNC staffer Seth Rich may have been a source for WikiLeaks. Rich, 27, was found with multiple gunshot wounds to the back at a Washington, D.C., intersection in July. He died soon thereafter. Authorities believe Rich was the target of a botched robbery, but his death has inspired conspiracy theories. WikiLeaks has published more than 10 million leaked emails, including sensitive information about prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and a cache of diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies around the world.",

            "article_content": "James Rosen reports from Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court, while holding back on dealing with some of the country\u2019s most controversial issues amid the vacancy on the bench, is still scheduled to tackle some key cases in its new term that starts Monday. Almost 40 appeals are currently on the docket. About three-dozen more are expected to be added in coming months. The caseload is usually settled by February, with the term effectively ending in late June. Key cases already on the Supreme Court docket include: AT ISSUE:\u00a0Whether the exclusion of churches from a publicly funded aid program violates the Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses, if the state cannot establish a sufficiently valid Establishment Clause concern. THE CASE:\u00a0A local Christian church -- supported by the Alliance Defending Freedom -- sued after being denied Missouri state funds to improve the surface of a playground used by its preschool. The program gives grants to nonprofits seeking a safer recreational environment for children.\u00a0Missouri law prohibits direct government aid to educational institutions that have a religious affiliation. THE ARGUMENTS:\u00a0 A core tenet of the First Amendment says \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the Free Exercise thereof.\"\u00a0The state here says the church may still worship as it pleases without interference, but its constitutional rights do not extend to playgrounds.\u00a0The school counters that the government has not established a \"compelling\" interest for selective, discretionary exclusion. THE IMPACT:\u00a0 This may be the most-watched social issue addressed in the court's early term. The tension involving church-state intersections has been especially divisive in the current court. Some commentators have equated this religious liberty dispute with same-sex marriage, arguing the court should apply equal protection rights to churches, because the Missouri law actually makes it harder to seek aid from the government for a singled-out group. AT ISSUE: Separate appeals over what role race plays in creating voting districts. THE CASES:\u00a0Civil rights groups oppose the voting-district plan passed by the Virginia GOP-led House of Delegates, saying black voters were illegally packed into majority-black districts in a way that dilutes their voting power, boosting the prospects for GOP candidates in neighboring districts. A federal court sided with the state. North Carolina's voting districts were also drawn by a GOP-led legislature. Federal courts have found two of the state's congressional districts were the product of an unconstitutional gerrymander based on race, and ordered new maps be drawn. The high court in February refused the state's request to block that lower court order. The revised maps were used in North Carolina's June 7 primary, but now the larger issues are back at the Supreme Court. THE ARGUMENTS:\u00a0 Officials in both states say their maps were created to give Republicans an edge, but comply with the federal Voting Rights Act and were not based on illegal racial criteria. THE IMPACT:\u00a0 The issues will not be resolved before this election, but what the court does here will dramatically affect future partisan efforts to create electoral districts that would determine the balance of power in Congress and state legislatures. AT ISSUE:\u00a0 A pair of appeals from the nation's busiest execution state, testing the use of intellectual disability and race in criminal prosecutions. THE CASES:\u00a0\u00a0Bobby James Moore's lawyers say the state is not using the current medically accepted definition of mental competency, in violation of the 8th Amendment. Moore, who murdered a grocery store clerk during a robbery, has a 70 IQ, say his lawyers.\u00a0The Supreme Court initially agreed to decide a far more important companion question: whether Moore's 35-year death row incarceration was in itself \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" But the justices without explanation rescinded that aspect of the case two hours after issuing its order. In the separate case, Duane Buck's own trial lawyers called a psychologist to the stand, who testified Buck would be likely to be a societal threat in the future, if not put to death, because he is black. Buck, who murdered his girlfriend and another man, now challenges his legal team's effectiveness and the state's standards for allowing challenges to a jury's conclusions of a defendant's \"future dangerousness.\" THE ARGUMENTS:\u00a0 The Supreme Court in 2002 outlawed the death penalty for the intellectually disabled, but has struggled to clarify the mix of definitions used by different states, especially whether a clean IQ benchmark standard of competency exists. Separately, the justices in recent years have also thrown out instances of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, in a range of criminal cases, but have generally taken a case-by-case approach in determining when such behavior is so egregious that defendants deserve new trials. THE IMPACT:\u00a0 Texas has conducted nearly 540 executions since 1976, nearly five times the total of any other state. The cases come as use of capital punishment nationwide continues to shrink. AT ISSUE:\u00a0 The scope of a 1998 congressional law designed to limit the use of \"acting\" appointments to fill agency and board vacancies, specifically the naming of a general counsel to the NLRB. THE CASE: An Arizona ambulance service sanctioned by the board now challenges the appointment, since the general counsel had already been nominated to the post, but the Senate had not yet acted on it. THE ARGUMENTS: President Obama has asserted his constitutional authority to keep the government functioning when Congress refuses to do its job in a timely manner. But members of Congress counter the executive cannot do an end-run around the process, whatever the reason. THE IMPACT:\u00a0 The high court for the second time in two years will examine the limits of the president's power to fill government positions under his executive authority discretion.\u00a0The justices in 2014 separately ruled Obama has limited power to make \"recess\" appointments when the Senate is not in active session. AT ISSUE:\u00a0\u00a0 Does a key section of the federal trademark law banning \"offensive\" names represent an unconstitutional restraint of speech? THE CASE:\u00a0 An Oregon-based \"Chinatown dance rock\" band, \u00a0made up of Asian-Americans, was denied a trademark by an agency tribunal because its name -- the Slants-- was considered racially disparaging. THE ARGUMENTS:\u00a0\u00a0Section 2a of the Lanham Act excludes \"scandalous, immoral, or disparaging marks.\"\u00a0A federal court disagreed with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office's interpretation of the law. The owners of the Washington Redskins have tried to link their parallel case -- Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse -- to the Tam appeal, but so far the justices will only address the band's claims. The franchise's trademarks were canceled after officials concluded they disparaged Native Americans. IMPACT:\u00a0 Beyond the constitutional principles at stake, these cases are also about money, and the financial stakes for well-known brands could be huge if other questionable trademarks are also banned. AT ISSUE:\u00a0 Two separate challenges dealing with remedies for criminal suspects who make claims of racial bias. THE CASES: In a search and seizure dispute, Elijah Manuel, who is black, was stopped for a traffic violation by white police officers in Illinois. He claims officers were abusive and falsely arrested him, believing a bottle of vitamins in his pocket was illegal Ecstasy. For the other case, Miguel Angel Pena-Rodriguez was convicted of sexual harassment of two teenaged girls. Afterwards, two jurors told defense lawyers that a fellow juror made a number of racist comments about Mexicans during deliberations. THE ARGUMENTS:\u00a0 Manuel claims an individual Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure, which gives him the right to sue for \"malicious prosecution.\"\u00a0Pena-Rodriguez's lawyers argue jurors can be questioned after a trial is over about one of their colleague's support for a guilty verdict because of the defendant's racial or ethnic identity. The respective governments say the allegations do not rise to the level for new trials. THE IMPACT: The court in May signaled its concern for the racial makeup of juries, ordering a new trial for a Georgia death-row inmate, concluding prosecutors intentionally kept blacks off the jury.",

The Democratic base is in an uproar over the proposed strikes, but neither Biden nor Clinton can politely distance themselves from the president\u2019s policies. They own them. But they can begin a long, slow march away from their president. Biden could face grilling at steak fry - Vice President Joe Biden heads to Iowa Sunday for Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s annual steak fry. The Des Moines Register reports that President Obama\u2019s friction with Harkin and other liberal lawmakers about Obama\u2019s now-shelved request for congressional backing for strikes against Syria could complicate what is usually a casting call for presidential contenders in the home state for the first-in-the-nation nominating caucus.

Biden, speaking at\u00a0a celebration of the act\u2019s 19th anniversary at his official residence, prefaced his \u201cNeanderthal\u201d claim thusly: \u201cI'm going to say something outrageous.\u201d He also touted his legislative expertise: \u201cI think I understand the Senate better than any man or women who\u2019s ever served in there.\u201d WILL HILLARY ADDRESS SYRIA ON WORLD STAGE? - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in Scotland today to speak to the graduating class at St. Andrew\u2019s University. With Britain already backed out of a U.S. coalition for Syria strikes and strong public sentiment there against joining the conflict, what will America\u2019s former top diplomat say?

Corruption probe touches Hillary - WaPo reports federal investigators are probing a senior campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, Minyon Moore, as they seek to build a case against D.C. businessman Jeffrey Thompson for his role in launching a shadow campaign to elect D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray. Trickles down to Virginia governor race - WaPo also reports Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, the longtime top fundraiser for the Clintons, will not return a donation to his 2009 governor campaign from Thompson. [WSJ\u2019s Kimberly Strassel: \u201cThese questions stretch beyond shady money funneling to Gray and Clinton campaigns.

Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov continue their discussions today in Geneva over a Russian offer to help secure Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. [Watch Fox: Richard Grenell, former State Department spokesman, appears in the 10 a.m. ET hour] Not a game - \u201cExpectations are high.

Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Michael McCaul, R-Texas, to discuss the challenges of securing chemical weapons in civil war-torn Syria, and the potential pitfalls of relying on Russia. CONGRESS NOT WAITING ON OBAMA - Campaign Carl Cameron - \u201cCould the rare, bipartisan emergency meeting of the nation\u2019s top four congressional leaders Thursday signal that Hill leaders have given up hope of real help from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue on solving looming fiscal crises? Congress has learned to expect little from President Obama where budget matters are concerned. And the president's zig-zagging struggle for a coherent Syria policy has led many to conclude that the president is no longer becoming a lame duck. He is one. House Speaker John Boehner, along with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, sat down with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to discuss the possibility of a government\u00a0shutdown at the end of this month, raising the $16 trillion\u00a0federal debt limit debt in the next five weeks and dealing with the next round of \u2018sequestration\u2019 spending caps. Democrats and Republicans are light years apart on how best to deal with these fiscal issues.\u00a0 Most will be handled with a series of delaying tactics that will keep the government operating but ignore the hard choices needed for lasting solutions. Those fights will be fierce and could take the government to the brink, or over it. But the one politician in the mix who no longer worries about future elections is, of course, President Obama. On the Hill, friends and foes alike are already seeing signs that he is now thinking and acting that way.\u201d \u2013 Carl Cameron Boehner in a bind - Conservativemembers of House Speaker John Boehner's caucus are demanding a vote on a measure to defund ObamaCare as part of ongoing budget talks. Conservative lawmakers rejected a compromise plan from leadership earlier this week. Boehner told reporters: \u201cI'm well aware of the deadlines\u2026 I think there's a way to get there\u2026 There are a million options that are being discussed by a lot of people.\u201d Baier Tracks: Don\u2019t blame the messenger\u2026 \u201cAs the Obama administration is having horrible problems trying to contain the Syria crisis, House Speaker John Boehner appears to be having real problems controlling his Republican caucus. Some Republicans say it\u2019s being trumped up by the media with headlines like this in the NYT: \u201cBoehner Seeking Democrats\u2019 Help on Fiscal Talks.\u201d The problem: It is all true. This could be a bumpy road to Sept. 30 and a continuing resolution to fund the government, and an even bumpier ride to raise the debt ceiling by mid-October.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier The last time there was a shutdown - Glen Bolger of top GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies reviews\u00a0how the public blamed Republicans for the 1995 -1996 government shutdowns and how the party\u2019s standing quickly diminished. Then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s approval level bounced to 60 percent while a plurality (48 percent) of respondents blamed Republicans for the shutdown. The same share of voters approved of how Clinton handled the budget negotiations, with only 22 percent approving of then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s approach.

            "article_content": "Conservative YouTube star says his generation deserves answers about their future The pint-sized Georgia firebrand whose videos blasting President Obama and espousing conservative values have drawn millions of online views sparked a controversy - and an investigation - this week with the claim that a former teacher said he was \u201cnot worth saving in a fire.\u201d CJ Pearson, 13, and now in the eighth grade, wrote on his widely followed Facebook page that a schoolmate told him his sixth-grade teacher told his class Pearson had once passed around vocabulary words prior to a test, and that the boy thought he was \u201call that and a bag of chips\u201d and was \u201cnot worth saving in a fire.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s always great having a teacher that\u2019s not only a liberal bully, but someone who engages in slander.\u201d When classes resumed at Columbia Middle School after the Columbus Day weekend, officials vowed to investigate the claim. \u201cThis was brought to our attention after it was posted on social media,\" school Principal Eli Putnam told BizPac Review on Tuesday. \"We have been on an extended holiday weekend and will conduct a full review of the allegations once school resumes tomorrow,\u201d Putnam wrote. \u201cColumbia Middle School believes all students should be taught in a safe and positive environment. Accordingly, if the claims are substantiated we will handle the issue as a personnel matter.\u201d Pearson's videos have helped the Georgia boy develop a large following. (Facebook) Columbia County schools Superintendent Sandra Carraway later told The Augusta Chronicle that all 25 students in the class where teacher Michael Garrison allegedly made the remark were interviewed and that only some of the comments were verified. Carraway declined further comment and said the situation is considered a personnel matter and it would be addressed accordingly. She declined to comment about any specific disciplinary measures the teacher might face because of the incident. Pearson believes the comments were relayed accurately to him. \u201cIt\u2019s always great having a teacher that\u2019s not only a liberal bully, but someone who engages in slander,\u201d he said. Pearson has met with conservative politicians including presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as well as former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., who have praised him for videos in which he excoriates President Obama, Hillary Clinton, gun control, the Black Lives Matter movement and various other people and causes. \"But here\u2019s what you need to realize: Here in America, we don\u2019t back down to terrorists,\" Pearson said in a February viral video in which he addressed President Obama. \"We fight them on their own battleground, and we annihilate them till the very end. Here in America, we don\u2019t allow the government to take away what we work for, but we continue to work harder so that we may continue to succeed.\u201d",

            "article_content": "James Rosen reports from Washington, D.C. The White House confirmed Monday that Obama adviser Ben Rhodes will not be allowed to testify before House lawmakers on the Iran nuclear deal, after a last-ditch attempt by Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz to pry the controversial aide loose for the hearing. Chaffetz and the White House have been engaged in an escalating feud, all on the heels of a New York Times Magazine piece where Rhodes was quoted boasting about the administration\u2019s success in crafting a public narrative for the Iran deal. The profile on Rhodes quotes him saying they built an \u201cecho chamber\u201d of experts who sold that narrative to young, often inexperienced reporters. Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, wanted the deputy national security adviser to testify at a hearing set for Tuesday titled, \u201cWhite House narratives on the Iran Nuclear Deal.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re planning as if he is attending, and he\u2019ll have a comfortable seat awaiting his arrival,\u201d Chaffetz said Monday afternoon of Rhodes. But W. Neil Eggleston, White House counsel, sent a letter to Chaffetz late Monday saying Rhodes would not attend. He cited what appeared to be an executive privilege-related claim, asserting that such a senior presidential adviser\u2019s appearance \u201cthreatens the independence and autonomy of the President, as well as his ability to receive candid advice and counsel.\u201d For those reasons, he said, \u201cwe will not make Mr. Rhodes available to testify.\u201d Chaffetz earlier had made a last-ditch attempt to pressure Rhodes into appearing. After White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest initially said he should invite GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, whom he accuses of spreading false information about the deal, Chaffetz did exactly that -- inviting Cotton to testify, on condition that Rhodes appeared as well. \u201c[Earnest] suggested that you should be invited to appear at the hearing as well, because you have some 'interesting insight' into the JCPOA [the Iran deal]. Therefore your appearance before the Committee would be contingent on Mr. Rhodes\u2019 appearance at that hearing,\u201d Chaffetz said in a letter Friday. Asked earlier Monday about the possibility of a\u00a0Rhodes appearance, Earnest did not rule it out but expressed what he called \"thinly veiled skepticism about the whole exercise\" and reiterated his claim that it is Republicans who should answer \"for saying a lot of things about the Iran deal that turned out not to be true.\" The letter from Eggleston later made clear Rhodes would not attend. Though Eggleston cited an executive privilege claim, Earnest told Fox News just four days earlier that \u201cthis has nothing to do with executive privilege.\u201d Sources tell Fox News that the committee was keen for Rhodes to appear voluntarily so they avoid the territory of a possible subpoena. The magazine article that touched off the controversy outlined how Rhodes created a narrative of the deal coming out of the 2013 election of \u201cmoderate\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Iran\u2019s subsequent \u201copenness\u201d and willingness to negotiate. In fact, the story stated, the majority of the deal was hammered out in 2012, well before Rouhani\u2019s election. However, the Rhodes narrative was politically useful to the administration as it presented them as reaching out to the moderates who wanted peace. Fox News\u2019 James Rosen and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

Clementa Pinckney's casket to the  Statehouse, Wednesday, June 24, 2015, in Columbia, S.C. Pinckney's open coffin was being put on display under the dome where he served the state for nearly 20 years. Pinckney was one of those killed in a mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. (AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt) (The Associated Press) 1:15 p.m. Mourners are walking past the open casket of slain state Sen. Clementa Pinckney at the South Carolina Statehouse. Pinckney is dressed in a dark suit and red tie. The mourners were greeted Wednesday by at least half a dozen of his colleagues and his widow and two young daughters. Beside the casket, there's a portrait of Pinckney at the Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, where he was the lead pastor and where he was killed along with eight parishioners last week. On the other side of the casket, there's a painting of his smiling face and the Statehouse. Hundreds of people were waiting in line when the doors opened Wednesday. ___ 1:10 p.m. Hundreds of people were in line among the trees along the sidewalks on the Statehouse grounds as the viewing for slain state Sen. Clementa Pinckney began. Among those in line Wednesday, Bishop Robert Guglielmone of the Catholic Diocese of Charleston, which covers all of South Carolina, led a group of about half a dozen priests. \"This is an opportunity for all to come and be a part of this whole process of healing,\" Guglielmone said of participating in the viewing. The bishop says he has been in Charleston for more than six years and knew the Rev. Pinckney from various interfaith gatherings. Pinckney was pastor at Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, where he was killed along with eight parishioners last week. Guglielmone said he has asked his churches to participate in a series of prayers for the souls of those who died. He hopes \"all of us begin this healing that is needed because it has affected everyone.\" ___ 12:55 p.m. Four Confederate flags have been removed from the grounds of the Alabama Capitol at the order of Republican Gov. Robert Bentley. They came down Wednesday. Bentley says he issued the order late Tuesday after ensuring he had the authority. He says it's important to honor history but that it can be done without flying the flag on Capitol grounds. Bentley calls the Confederate battle flag a distraction and compares it to the swastika. He says: \"Unfortunately, it's like the swastika \u2014 some people have adopted that as part of their hate-filled groups.\" After the flags' removal, two men identifying themselves as members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans arrived to protest. When a group of black men, including the chief of staff for an Alabama Democrat who planned to introduce a resolution calling for the flags' removal, came to see that the flags had been removed, they spoke and shook hands with the flag supporters. Calls to remove Confederate symbols reignited after the massacre of nine people at a black church in South Carolina last week. The white suspect posed in photos displaying Confederate flags. ___ 12:30 p.m. Representatives of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence brought several boxes holding about 10,000 messages of support from people around the country to the historic Charleston church were the pastor and eight parishioners were slain. Dan Gross, the Brady Campaign president, said it had received messages from all 50 states. He gave brief remarks along with state Rep. Wendell Gilliard of Charleston and the state's poet laureate Marjory Wentworth, who read a poem she'd written for the victims. A note from Chicago says: \"My heart breaks for your loss.\" One from Columbia, South Carolina, says: \"With a heart filled with grief, I send you my love, hugs and sincerest sympathy.\" Throughout the morning, several dozen people were stopping by the front of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where people have placed bouquets, wreaths and other floral arrangements. ___ 12:25 p.m. St. Louis police are investigating after vandals targeted a century-old Confederate memorial, spray-painting the words \"Black Lives Matter\" on the statue. Police were called just before 8 a.m. Wednesday after a resident saw the damage on the 32-foot statue in Forest Park. Workers were cleaning the memorial. No arrests have been made. The Confederate flag and other Confederate symbols have come under renewed scrutiny in the week since a gunman killed nine at a black Charleston, South Carolina, church. A white man who has posed with the flag is charged. In April, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay directed a staff member to consider the future of the memorial. A report is expected by summer's end. The phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" took root in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in August, after 18-year-old Michael Brown Jr., who was black and unarmed, was killed by police officer Darren Wilson. Wilson was not criminally charged. ___ 12:20 p.m. Four former South Carolina governors issued a statement Wednesday applauding Gov. Nikki Haley's call to remove the Confederate battle flag from Statehouse grounds. The joint statement was signed by Ernest \"Fritz\" Hollings, Dick Riley, David Beasley and Jim Hodges. It reads, \"Last week's tragic events at Mother Emanuel AME Church have reminded us of the important bond we share as South Carolina citizens. We should fly only the United States and South Carolina flags on our Statehouse grounds \u2014 flags that represent us all.\" Beasley lost his bid for re-election in 1998 after advocating for its removal. He was at the Statehouse on Tuesday to encourage his former colleagues to support Haley's position. He said he was startled by how many legislators have switched positions in a matter of days. He says: \"Twenty years ago, they differed with me on this issue.\" Hollings, who went on to be a U.S. senator from 1966 to 2004, was governor when the Confederate flag was hoisted on top of the Statehouse dome. He called for it to come down in 2000, when legislators passed the compromise that moved a smaller, square version to a Confederate monument out front. ___ 12:10 p.m. A horse-drawn caisson carrying the body of slain state Sen. Clementa Pinckney is arriving at the South Carolina Statehouse so that people can pay their respects to him. The caisson passed directly by the Confederate flag on a pole on the Statehouse grounds. Pinckney, who was also a pastor at the African Methodist Episcopal Church, was one of nine people killed in an attack at the church a week ago. The caisson is flanked by two police cars with lights on. About 100 people stood in line Wednesday along the side of the Statehouse near the Confederate flag. Gloria Wingard, 66, of Columbia, had been there since 9:30 a.m. \"I'm here to honor him and the things that he'd done,\" she said of Pinckney. ___ 11:30 a.m. Workers are preparing the South Carolina Statehouse for the body of state Sen. Clementa Pinckney to lie under the dome in the place he served for nearly 20 years. A large, black drape was placed Wednesday over the big window of the second-floor lobby where Pinckney's coffin will be placed, blocking the view of the Confederate flag flying on a pole outside. Pinckney's head will be near the back of a statue of former Vice President John C. Calhoun, who forcefully suggested states should be able to decide not to follow federal laws they did not like in the 1820s and 1830s. Mourners will file past his feet. American and South Carolina flags are on poles near the statue. Workers are placing flowers as well as ropes to help line up the crowd. The last person to lie under the dome was former Gov. Carroll Campbell in December 2005. Pinckney will be the first African-American given the honor at least since Reconstruction. Public viewing starts at 1 p.m. Wednesday after a horse-drawn caisson brings Pinckney's body to the capitol. It ends at 5 p.m. ___ 11:25 a.m. Democrats say Congress should do better than vanquishing symbols of racism to fight discrimination, and they are moving forward with a plan targeting voting discrimination. A group of House and Senate lawmakers on Wednesday unveiled legislation to restore a requirement that some states get federal approval for voting procedure changes. Two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down the provision and, supporters of the policy say, set progress back. The move comes in the wake of the deaths of nine in a Charleston, South Carolina, black church. The massacre reignited a debate over the Confederate flag and other symbols of the Old South. Democratic Rep. Terry Sewell of Alabama says: \"It isn't enough that we have symbolic moments. We should not be able to choose our voters.\" The provision would require that any state with more than 15 voting rights violations since 1990 be subject to federal permission for any change in voting procedure or law. Sewell says that would mean 13 states right away would be subject to preclearance, until they go a full decade without a violation. ___ 11:15 a.m. One of Mississippi's Republican U.S. senators says the Confederate battle emblem should be removed from the state flag because it offends many people and gives a false impression of the state. Sen. Roger Wicker's statement Wednesday makes him the second top-tier Republican elected official calling for Mississippi to change the flag it has used since Reconstruction. He says it \"should be put in a museum and replaced by one that is more unifying.\" The state House speaker, Philip Gunn, said Monday that as a Christian, he believes the flag has become offensive. Mississippi voters decided in 2001 to keep the flag. The massacre of nine worshippers in a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, restarted debate about the Old South. The man charged in the slayings had posed in photos with the Confederate battle flag. ___ 11:10 a.m. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley has ordered Confederate flags taken down from the grounds of the state Capitol. It's the latest move to banish the divisive banner from state capitals, store shelves and monuments. The Republican governor issued the order Wednesday morning, one week after police say a white man killed nine black church members in Charleston, South Carolina in a racially motived attack. Since the mass shooting, there has been a groundswell of calls to remove the flag. For the past two decades, Alabama has displayed four Confederate flags around a large monument to Confederate soldiers outside the Alabama Capitol. On Wednesday, they had all come down. Bentley spokeswoman Jennifer Ardis tells The Associated Press that Bentley did not want the presence of the Confederate symbols to be \"a distraction.\" She said there was no law prohibiting the removal of the flags by executive order. ___ 10:45 a.m. A law enforcement official has confirmed to The Associated Press that investigators believe the suspect in the Charleston church massacre purchased the gun that was used in the crime at a store called Shooter's Choice in West Columbia, South Carolina. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss by name the details of a pending investigation. The officials says Dylann Roof purchased the weapon at the South Carolina store. The store has an indoor firing range and offers concealed weapons classes. On Wednesday, a man behind the store's counter said it doesn't give out information about customers. Roof is charged with nine counts of murder in the massacre. -- Associated Press writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed. ___ 10:40 a.m. Dash-cam video has been released of the arrest of the white man accused of opening fire inside a black church in Charleston, killing nine people. The nearly five minute video shows officers in Shelby, North Carolina, walking up to the car and then pulling 21-year-old Dylann Roof out of it. He doesn't resist. Roof is handcuffed and an officer searches him. The shooting happened on the night of June 17. Roof was arrested the following day in Shelby. The video also shows officers going through the trunk and when they walk away, they high five. ___ 9:35 a.m. An Episcopal Cathedral across from the South Carolina Statehouse is opening its doors for prayer and reflection during the time state Sen. Clementa Pinckney's casket is on view to the public. Trinity Episcopal Cathedral also plans to hold a noon prayer service and ring its bells each hour until 5 p.m. The church announced it would hold the special service with the assistance of the Rev. Calvin Griffin from St. Luke's Episcopal Church, which is the Cathedral's predominantly African-American neighbor parish. According to South Carolina historian Walter Edgar, the ties between Trinity and the state government go back to August of 1812. The eleven founding members of the congregation met in the Senate Chamber of the Old State House to form the nucleus of the Episcopal faithful, which would later become Trinity Church of Columbia.",

            "article_content": "FBI records show Pres. Obama used pseudonyms in emails with Hillary Clinton. When showed email, aide Huma Abedin asked, 'How is this not classified?' Fox News' Catherine Herridge reports President Obama\u2019s high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as \u201cwhitelisting\u201d that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News \u2013 pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account was used for government business. As the administration now acknowledges, Obama and Clinton emailed each other while she was helming the State Department. If received on his BlackBerry, the \u201cwhitelisting\u201d safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission \u2013 covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. \u201cThink of whitelisting like a bouncer in the VIP line at the party. If you are on the list you get in, if you are not, you get bounced to the pavement,\u201d said Bob Gourley, former chief technology officer (CTO) for the DIA, and now a partner with strategic consulting and engineering firm Cognitio. \u201cWhitelisting happens by design. The IT professionals who whitelist devices at places like the White House only add the email addresses authorized by management. To do otherwise would be to violate policy in ways that could introduce threats to the system,\u201d he added. A second former intelligence official, who asked to speak on background, described the same process for the president\u2019s BlackBerry, adding the timing is important. \u00a0If clintonemail.com were \u201cwhitelisted\u201d before March 2015, it would further undercut administration statements. President Obama initially claimed in March 2015, when the details of Clinton\u2019s secret server were first made public by the New York Times, that he only learned about the system from news reports, along with everyone else. Press Secretary Josh Earnest later walked that back, but maintained at the time that while Obama knew about Clinton\u2019s email address, he was not aware of how the address and server had been set up. While there is a difference between a private server and email address, if the president's BlackBerry were configured to accept the Clinton address, it would have been clear to those handling the request that clintonemail.com was not a government account. Both Gourley, and the second former intelligence official said typically these request comes from the White House Chief of Staff or a deputy, and are directed to the Secret Service and the White House Communications Agency (WHCA), which is a military unit assigned to the task. Earnest dismissed questions Wednesday about their March 2015 statements. \"The president's explanation in March of 2015 and my explanation of what the president knew in March of 2015 hasn't changed, and the truth is this is just critics of Secretary Clinton and President Obama recycling a conspiracy theory that has already been debunked,\" Earnest said. Emails hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account and posted by anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks have provided additional details about the problems Obama\u2019s initial statements caused in March 2015. One of Clinton's top aides urged colleagues to \"clean this up\" after Obama claimed he only learned of Clinton's private email system from news reports. According to one March 7, 2015 email, Cheryl Mills challenged the president\u2019s statement to CBS News. \"We need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov,\" Mills wrote to Podesta just before midnight. In emails released by the State Department earlier this year, Mills also asked Lewis Lukens, who was the executive director of the State Department\u2019s executive secretariat, about getting one of the highly secure BlackBerrys for then-Secretary Clinton. \u201cso I have now read up more on POTUS bb which appears not really to be a bb but a different device) \u00a0is there any solution to her being able to use encrypted bb like the nsa approved one he has in the vault, and if so, how can we get her one,\u201d she wrote. The request was never granted. Less than a month after Clinton became secretary of state, and the personal email domain that she would use exclusively for government business was registered, Hillary Clinton's team aggressively pursued changes to existing State Department security protocols so she could use her BlackBerry in secure facilities for classified information, according to new documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. \"Anyone who has any appreciation at all of security, you don't ask a question like that,\" cybersecurity analyst Morgan Wright told Fox News. \"It is contempt for the system, contempt for the rules that are designed to protect the exact kind of information that was exposed through this email set up.\" Current and former intelligence officials grimaced when asked by Fox News about the use of wireless communications devices, such as a BlackBerry, in a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) -- emphasizing its use would defeat the purpose of the secure facility, and it is standard practice to leave all electronics outside. A former State Department employee familiar with the Clinton request emphasized security personnel at the time thought the BlackBerry was only for unclassified material, adding their concerns would have been magnified if they had known Clinton's email account also held classified material. \"When you allow devices like this into a SCIF, you can allow the bad guys to listen in,\" Wright added. FBI records show that President Obama used at least one pseudonym to exchange emails with then Secretary of State Clinton. The State Department withheld eight email chains that totaled 18 messages between the president and Clinton which remain confidential under the Presidential communications privilege. Asked if the President\u2019s BlackBerry was configured to accept the clintonemail.com address, a spokesperson for the Secret Service referred questions to the White House Communications Agency and the White House Military Office. \u00a0Fox News is attempting to follow up with both.",

            "article_content": "President Obama said Saturday that the country is \"a better place today\" than when he graduated from college more than 30 years ago, citing his historic election as \"one indicator of how attitudes have changed.\" But gaps persist, he told Howard University's Class of 2016, citing racism and inequality. In a commencement speech at one of the nation's leading historically black schools, Obama said there were no black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and few black judges when Columbia University awarded him a bachelor's degree in 1983. \"A lot of folks didn't even think blacks had the tools to be a quarterback,\" Obama said. \"When I was a graduate, the main black hero on TV was Mr. T. Rap and hip-hop were counter-culture. Now (\"Scandal\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" producer) Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday night and Beyonce runs the world.\" Today, he said, \"we're producers, studio executives. We're no longer small-business owners, we're CEOs. We're mayors, representatives\" -- and someone in the crowd shouted out, \"President.\" \"I'm not saying gaps do not persist. Obviously, they do,\" Obama said. \"Racism persists, inequality persists.\" He called on the university's 2,300 graduates to step up and take on the work of closing those gaps. \"America needs you to gladly, happily take up that work ... so enjoy the party, because you're going to be busy,\" Obama said. He cited income inequality, an issue in the presidential campaign to choose his successor in November, as well as disparities in unemployment, pay and criminal justice. He also listed disease and conflict worldwide, along with terrorism and climate change as other issues needing attention. \"So make no mistake Class of 2016. You've got plenty of work to do,\" said Obama, who was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree. \"But as complicated and intractable as these challenges may see, the truth is your generation is better position than any before you to meet those challenges.\" \"America is a better place today than it was when I graduated from college,\" Obama said, adding \"by almost every measure.\" He said the country \"also happens to be better off than when I took office, but that's a longer story.\" The line drew cheers and applause. \"That's a different discussion for another speech,\" Obama said. Obama told the graduates to be confident and embrace being African-American and all that it entails, including \"our particular awareness of injustice and unfairness and struggle. That means we cannot sleepwalk through life. We cannot be ignorant of history. We cannot meet the world with a sense of entitlement.\" He urged them to vote and not to fear opposing voices. Many in the audience of about 15,000 chanted \"four more years\" as Obama received the honorary degree. He cited low voter turnout in general and among younger voters in particular for control of Congress switching from Democratic to Republican during his presidency. \"You don't think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I had to deal with,\" Obama said. \"And then people wonder why Obama didn't get this done or that done. \"Just vote. It's math.\" Obama, 54, opened by telling the graduates that most of them were just starting high school when he was first elected in 2008. \"I used to joke about being old. Now I realize I'm old. It's not a joke anymore,\" he said. The address was the first of three commencement speeches Obama has scheduled this spring, his final ones as president. Obama is set to speak May 15 at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and June 2 at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.",

            "article_content": "This is a huge weekend in The Bronx, with the rare \u201ccorpse flower\u201d blooming at the New York Botanical Garden. The enormous plant flowers only once every 10 years and is noted for, as the garden gently puts it, the \u201cinfamous odor it releases during its brief 24-36-hour peak.\u201d Visitors say the odor resembles a \u201cdead animal\u201d or \u201crotting flesh,\u201d while The Guardian newspaper found a 6-year-old boy who got a whiff and declared it \u201cworse than a thousand pukes.\u201d Naturally, huge crowds are rushing to smell for themselves. It could be a coincidence, but the bloom coincides with the start of the presidential general election, and there is another similarity as well: the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is also a hold-your-nose affair that is attracting huge crowds. Having spent most of the last two weeks at the parties\u2019 spirited conventions, I return to earth not with an infamous odor but with an ominous feeling. It goes beyond the flaws that Clinton and Trump both feature and the devilish web of problems the next president will face. My sense of dread stems from the fact that each party is speaking to a very different America. And not just about politics, but also about clashing concepts of pretty much everything. What those two Americas have in common is receding by the day, while their differences intensify and multiply. Here are some observations, and which party is which is obvious: We have the party of anger on one hand and the party of entitlement on the other. One party is fed up, the other wants to be fed. One wants free markets, the other wants free stuff. These are vast generalizations, but they contain much more than a kernel of truth. These differences dictate the choice of nominees and the policies they pursue. So one party wants lower taxes, the other wants higher taxes, one wants fewer regulations, the other wants more. Go a step further, and it\u2019s Blue Lives Matter vs. Black Lives Matter. One party vows to destroy radical Islam, the other refuses to say its name. Conventions always aim to offer contrasts as motivation, but this year\u2019s polarization is more dangerous because neither candidate has much crossover appeal. Trump and Clinton deserve each other because they share the distinction of having the highest negative ratings ever held by presidential nominees.

This is a major victory for the Heritage Action PAC, the group led by former Sen. Jim DeMint, which has threatened to help unseat any Republican who votes for any bill that does not strip out new funding for ObamaCare. It\u2019s also going to slow down the process of finding a way to avert a government shutdown on Oct. 1. [Watch Fox: Sen. Jon Barrasso, R-Wyo., Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee discusses ObamaCare in the 10 a.m. ET hour] Tick, tick, tick \u2013 Leadership aides say that under the plan, the House would pass the defunding bill, sending it to the Democratic Senate where Majority Leader Harry Reid would likely strip out the provision, setting up a days-long procedural battle with conservatives, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. With a government shutdown just 12 days away, leaders in both parties are anxious. The best-case scenario for avoiding a shutdown looks to be a swift defeat in the Senate for the measure, beginning the process of building a bipartisan coalition in support of an emergency funding bill in the House. The takeaway - DeMint is closer to his apparent goal of forcing a painful vote on members of his own party: Shut down the government or fund the president\u2019s health law. But the question stands, if the government shuts down, how would Republicans reopen it? By staking their fight on an ideological rather than a fiscal claim, Republicans would set up a battle with the president in which no compromise would be possible: A zero-sum game taking place against the backdrop of a chaotic disruption of government services.

            "article_content": "Does the Republican presidential nominee have evidence to support his case? After a week of political earthquakes, perhaps the biggest surprise is that the presidential race hasn\u2019t changed much. A bevy of national and battleground polls taken since a 2005 tape surfaced of Donald Trump\u2019s vulgar comments about women \u2013 followed by a cascade of groping allegations against the GOP nominee as well as numerous embarrassing revelations for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign from a WikiLeaks hack \u2013 shows the Democratic nominee widening her lead only slightly. Clinton, as before, maintains the clear advantage going into Nov. 8 and has many more paths to the necessary 270 electoral votes than Trump. And for the first time this year, Clinton is now above 45 percent in a four-way race, based on the RealClearPolitics average of national polls. But the race remains tight in key battlegrounds like Ohio, and Trump has even edged Clinton in at least one national survey since the Billy Bush bombshell. \u201cI think what's happening is this is a highly contested election, and it's going to be fought all the way to the finish,\u201d Trump running mate Mike Pence told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Democratic counterpart Tim Kaine, said, \u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve said this would be a very close campaign.\u201d While the Clinton campaign has hammered Trump over the allegations of sexual harassment and assault, the Republican nominee has adamantly denied them, while complaining that the media are conspiring against him. The trajectory of the polls could speak to how few undecided voters really are left in a race where the differences between the major-party nominees are stark. In some of the most recent findings, Rasmussen Reports released new results Monday showing Clinton edging Trump 43-41 percent among likely U.S. voters \u2013 retaking a slight lead after Trump led the same poll by 2 points late last week. Over the weekend, a Washington Post-ABC News poll also showed Clinton with a 47-43 percent lead over Trump, essentially unchanged compared to the groups\u2019 earlier polls. A Fox News national poll released last week showed Clinton expanding her lead among likely voters, to 45-38 percent when third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were included. One of the widest leads for Clinton was seen in Sunday\u2019s NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, showing Clinton with a significant 11-point lead over Trump among likely voters. But at the state level, the same pollsters showed Trump ahead by 1 point in Ohio. To be sure, Trump\u2019s potential path to victory is exceedingly narrow. In states considered essential for his campaign \u2013 Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and even Virginia \u2013 the RealClearPolitics average shows Clinton with the edge. In North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida, Clinton\u2019s lead is nominal. In Pennsylvania and Virginia, Trump continues to trail badly. New CNN battleground polls out Monday reflect a somewhat closer race, with Trump up by 4 points in Ohio and Clinton up by 1 in North Carolina among likely voters. The interviewing for the poll, however, stretches back to Oct. 10 and may not entirely reflect voters\u2019 reaction to all of last week\u2019s allegations.",

An Illinois Veterans Affairs hospital already under fire for excessive wait times, festering black mold and kitchen cockroaches faces a new shame \u2013 the bodies of dead patients left unclaimed in the morgue for up to two months without proper burial, whistleblower documents allege. The whistleblower, whose identity is not being revealed for fear of retaliation, complained last month to the VA\u2019s inspector general about the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital\u2019s handling of veterans\u2019 remains in cases where families have not come forward to claim the body. The complaint singled out Christopher Wirtjes, chief of Patient Administrative Services, saying \u201cThe Chief of PAS has the funds available, yet has no sense of urgency to lay the veteran to rest.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., whose office also received the complaint along with emails, is now calling for Wirtjes\u2019 firing and in a statement, slammed the hospital \u2013 located in the Western suburbs of Chicago -- over its recent history of controversies. \u201cHines VA -- the hospital that has been overrun with cockroaches and mold and left vets waiting for care for months on secret wait lists,\u00a0has reached a new low in the\u00a0treatment\u00a0of our veterans,\u201d Kirk told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe now have reports of bodies being left to decompose in the morgue for months on end.\u201d The whistleblower, who has spoken with Kirk\u2019s office, described a \u201chorrible issue\u201d at the hospital in the letter to the IG: \u201cSome veteran\u2019s remains have been left in our hospital morgue for 45 days or more until they are stacked to capacity at times.\u201d On at least one occasion, a body had liquefied and the bag burst when staff had attempted to move it, said Alissa McCurley, Kirk\u2019s deputy chief of staff. Kirk talked to VA Secretary Bob McDonald last week in Washington and demanded the firing of Wirtjes,\u00a0whom the Office of Special Counsel determined\u00a0had orchestrated a\u00a0secret wait list\u00a0that was exposed by another whistleblower in 2014. McDonald was noncommittal, Kirk said. Internal VA emails chronicle how a frustrated Hines clerk attempted to obtain permission from Wirtjes for burial of unclaimed veterans on three occasions. The first email chain began on Dec. 7, 2015. \u201c[There is] an invoice for an unclaimed veteran that has been here for over 30 days. Please approve for burial at Abraham Lincoln,\u201d the clerk wrote to Wirtjes and several others. Three days later, the clerk wrote again: \u201cApproval of unclaimed Vet D?? Status?\u201d On Dec. 23, the clerk wrote to human resources: \u201cAny further on my poor unclaimed? I WILL file a police report, but I hate doing that\u2026\u201d Emails from\u00a0 June 14, 2016 and Aug. 29, 2016 state that two different veterans languished in the morgue for a month or more. A manager, who is the chief of inpatient and processing, discussed the dilemma of how a local mortuary would be paid for accepting a veteran\u2019s body because the family did not have the money for a burial. He said he would \u201ctry to figure it out with the funeral home. \u2026 At least he would be laid to rest.\u201d \u201cI have not heard anything as to the approval for funeral home pick up. It will be a month tomorrow,\u201d the clerk responded. Cook County policy suggests embalming three days after death \u201cat the discretion of the medical examiner.\u201d Often, the body will be embalmed and returned to a freezer for up to a month while the medical examiner attempts to locate family members. Unclaimed bodies are then buried in a county cemetery. Veterans are interred in a national military cemetery within 60 days. However, Hines does not employ medical examiners or embalmers to properly care for decedents locked in their freezer for 30 days or more, McCurley said. Wirtjes could not be reached for comment despite inquiries to him, his office and a VA center spokesman. But the spokesman for the hospital, Rick Fox, disputed the allegations and said Hines was following all laws: \u201cWe take whistleblower allegations very seriously and absolutely agree that all of our veterans deserve dignity and respect, in life and in death. While our investigation into this matter is still ongoing, we have found allegations related to consistent problems with dignified and timely burials to be unsubstantiated. However, we have taken this opportunity to review our policies and procedures and are currently working to improve them.\u201d Staff from the VA\u2019s Office of Medical Inspector were at the hospital conducting an investigation Monday afternoon, but it\u2019s unclear what they found, McCurley said. Asked about the allegations, the IG office said: \"The OIG doesn\u2019t confirm or deny the existence of any ongoing investigations.\" Kirk, chairman of the Appropriations Committee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, last week introduced a bill titled Respectful Interment for Passing Veterans Act\u00a0which requires \u201cexpeditious and respectful provision of burial and funeral services for indigent, deceased veterans and remains of deceased veterans that are unclaimed.\u201d Earlier this year, Kirk authored a bill requiring VA kitchens to undergo regular health inspections after Hines\u00a0whistleblowers repeatedly documented cockroaches\u00a0served in food. The VA system currently has no required kitchen health inspections from an outside entity. In September 2015, veterans from Hines\u2019 long-term care facility complained of a\u00a0black mold infestation\u00a0that had gone unchecked. Hines is planning on demolishing the kitchen in an effort to destroy the roaches and will renovate the long-term care facility within 45 days, the spokesperson said. Kirk sent a two-page letter to the secretary Wednesday to press for Wirtjes\u2019 firing.\u00a0A 2014 law\u00a0created after the VA wait list scandal gave McDonald the power to fire civil service employees engaged in misconduct. \u201cIf manipulating scheduling wait times\u00a0putting veterans\u2019 health at risk\u00a0and failing to\u00a0allow the burial of\u00a0unclaimed veterans\u2019 remains is not misconduct, then I ask you what is,\u201d Kirk wrote. UPDATE \u2013 After the publication of this article, the VA issued the following statement: \u201cStaff at Hines VA Hospital conducted a fact-finding investigation that shows over the last two years, the vast majority - more than 95 percent - of Veterans\u2019 remains are being respectfully handled within seven days, and more than 99 percent within 30 days. Additionally, VA\u2019s Office of Medical Inspector (OMI) spent significant time at the facility last week interviewing employees and reviewing related materials. And while we are awaiting OMI\u2019s final report, we remain confident that our Veterans have been receiving dignified and timely burials.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream reports from Washington, D.C. BISMARCK, N.D. \u2013 A federal judge on Monday blocked North Dakota's voter identification law after a group of American Indians said it unfairly burdens them \u2014 the latest court ruling against voting laws that critics say disproportionately affect minorities. U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland issued a temporary restraining order and criticized the state for its 2013 repeal of provisions that let people without valid IDs vote if someone vouched for them or if they signed an affidavit swearing they were a qualified voter. \"The public interest in protecting the most cherished right to vote for thousands of Native Americans who currently lack a qualifying ID and cannot obtain one, outweighs the purported interest and arguments of the State,\" Hovland wrote. He added: \"There are a multitude of easy remedies that most states have adopted in some form to alleviate this burden.\" It was the latest setback in the courts for Republican efforts that critics say are intended to restrict voting rights but that supporters tout as anti-fraud measures that keep non-citizens from voting. In three separate rulings Friday, a federal appeals court blocked North Carolina's law requiring photo ID, a federal judge in Wisconsin ordered changes to make it easier for voters to get a valid ID, and a Kansas judge said the state must count thousands of votes from people who didn't provide proof of citizenship when they registered. Earlier in July, a federal appellate court ruled that Texas' voter ID law was discriminatory. The North Dakota lawsuit was filed in January by seven members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. North Dakota doesn't have voter registration, but the state has required voters to provide ID since 2004. Before that, casting a ballot was an informal process in most precincts, and identification cards were seldom requested. North Dakota accepts a driver's license as identification or identity cards issued by the state, long-term care facilities or North Dakota's American Indian tribes. All must have a valid address. The state argued that its requirements were reasonable and that the tribal members who sued hadn't shown that the burdens for them to obtain a valid ID were any more restrictive than for non-Native Americans. Before 2013, if a voter lacked an ID card but a poll worker had firsthand knowledge of the person's identity and residence, the voter was allowed to cast a ballot. The voter also could sign an affidavit attesting to his or her eligibility to vote in the precinct. Tom Dickson, an attorney for the north-central North Dakota tribal members, said the 2013 change by the GOP-controlled Legislature amounted to having people \"pay to vote.\" He said some tribal members can't afford the required identification, and others had to pay to get their tribal IDs updated with a valid address. \"This was blatantly discriminatory,\" Dickson said. \"The point of these laws is to keep people from voting and suppressing the Native American vote, who generally vote Democratic in North Dakota.\" Secretary of State Al Jaeger, North Dakota's top election official, said the state will follow the federal judge's order. \"We'll just have to go back to how it was prior to 2013,\" Jaeger said. \"That's all we can do at this particular point.\" Hovland wrote that \"undisputed statistics and studies support the finding that, given the disparities in living conditions, it is not surprising that North Dakota's new voter ID laws are having and will continue to have a disproportionately negative impact on Native American voting-eligible citizens.\" He cited expert witness who testified that almost one-quarter of eligible Native American voters do not have proper voting identification, compared with 12 percent for non-Native American Indians. The judge also wrote that only 78 percent of Native Americans have a driver's license that they could potentially use as voter identification, compared with 94 percent of non-Natives.",

            "article_content": "A policewoman demonstrates a Vietnamese-made pistol during celebrations to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Vietnam Public Security police force at the National Convention Center in Hanoi August 18, 2015. The Vietnam Police force was founded on August 19, 1945, the day of the anti-colonial people's uprising known as the August Revolution. REUTERS/Kham - RTX1OLM6 (Reuters) Gretchen Lager's fondest childhood memories involved shooting bullets at tin cans and balloons along the Slippery Rock Creek in western Pennsylvania - but one day in 1995, guns became a far more menacing presence in her life. Her brother-in-law killed his wife of 30 years - Lager's sister - with a deer hunting rifle. He then turned the gun on himself in a murder-suicide that orphaned their 15-year-old daughter. For years afterwards, Lager was stridently anti-gun. \"I have been hating guns with everything I believe until lately,\" she said. But earlier this year, Lager recalled those more pleasant childhood memories, \"and I thought, `there's something about guns that I really know and love. There's a mechanical beauty. There's something fun about it.\"' Lager, 64, who now lives in Hershey, purchased a .22-caliber pistol more than two months ago to rekindle her target shooting hobby and enrolled in a gun safety class at the Palmyra Sportsmen's Association. Still, she's far from the stereotype of a gun owner, decked out in camouflage and stockpiling weapons while waiting for the apocalypse. Lager hates the National Rifle Association - \"I think they are opportunists\" - believes in mandatory training for people purchasing guns, and would never want to use her firearm to hurt an animal, much less a person. Instead, she considers herself part of a \"silent majority\" between two political extremes on guns. Lebanon County residents are buying guns and obtaining permits to carry firearms with increasing frequency, according to data kept by the Pennsylvania State Police. Local gun stores said many of their first-time firearms owners are, like Lager, outside of the stereotypical gun-owning demographics: women, older couples, even 80-plus-year-old women and the disabled. Why people buy weapons Steve Wier holds one-on-one firearm safety courses for first-time gun buyers at Enck's Gun Barn in Myerstown, and always asks his students why they wanted the training. One man had agreed to learn to shoot as a bonding activity with his son. After his son passed away, he decided to become trained in firearms anyway in his son's memory. Couples have told Wier they are looking for a sport they can do together when one of them has a physical problem that prevents other activities. The most frequent reason is a desire to get involved in competitive shooting, and it's not uncommon to meet people who want to dress up as cowboys and cowgirls for Western-style weapon competitions. Personal defense is often a secondary reason, but it's on most students' lists, he said. Some people consider firearm safety to be like knowing how to swim - good general knowledge even if you don't plan to carry a gun. While Lebanon County still has a strong hunting and sport shooting community, the most commonly growing reason people are seeking firearms is personal protection, local gun sellers said. Shyda's Outdoor Center caters primarily to hunters, but Vice President Brad Shyda said interest in hunting rifles is down and purchases of semi-automatic weapons for self-defense purposes are up even at his store. \"You can tell all their lives they've been against guns, but now they want to feel safe,\" he said. \"They come in and say, `I want a 9mm' - they don't even know what a 9mm looks like, but they want a 9mm.\" Politics probably plays a role. Fears of a possible president Hillary Clinton banning firearms is likely motivating people to purchase guns in the same way President Barack Obama's two elections led to spikes in gun sales, Shyda said. \"We're seeing that deep mistrust everywhere, in every corner of society, whether it be guns, Black Lives Matter, the trans(gender) community,\" said Craig Good, an Annville resident and salesman for Elizabethtown-based Lanco Tactical. \"Just because (government leaders) say one thing, nobody really believes it because our politicians don't stand behind it.\" Improvements in the types of tactical semi-automatic weapons available to civilians may also be making such weapons more attractive, said Art Kalbach, a gun salesman for Lanco Tactical. \"When I bought my first AR-15, there were two choices: a long one or a short one,\" Kalbach said, but there are many more styles and types of semi-automatic guns available now. \"Tactic-cool\" If world emergencies magnified by media hype can fuel the fear of guns, gun store owners admitted they can also boost their sales. The world \"tactical\" has become such a buzzword that Lanco Tactical Owner Nathan Lamb jokes about being \"tactic-cool,\" although he opened his store years before the fad started, he said. The word has more to do with a mindset of being \"prepared for the unknown\" than a type of weapon, Lamb said. That demographic is often also interested in other products Lanco Tactical offers, such as non-perishable food and survival gear. \"I think people are finally starting to realize that just because it could happen to anybody, that doesn't mean it couldn't happen to you,\" Good said. Good said gun owners who want to be able to defend themselves from an increasingly scary world find themselves stereotyped by people who don't own weapons. He's heard gun control advocates go as far as wishing someone be shot with their own gun in an attempt to make a point on social media. \"They say unfair things like, `all gun owners are crazy.' I think that's unfair because they don't know me. They don't know that I'm a school teacher, they don't know my friends, they don't know the people I associate with,\" he said. But wait - Is there really a trend? Statistical information about firearm owners is limited due to concerns by gun rights supporters that gun registration would lead to confiscation, so it is difficult to get a handle on the amount of first-time firearm purchasers. Lebanon County Sheriff Bruce Klingler said in November that he had seen a spike in permit applications after terrorist attacks in Paris, but said more recently that the trend has leveled off. Statewide, the number of monthly background checks recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigations for gun permits and purchases spiked in December 2015 and have remained higher than the previous year for each month since then. Margot Bennett, executive director of Women Against Gun Violence, said claims that more people are becoming first-time firearm owners should be treated with caution due to the lack of available data. \"Although gun purchases are on the rise, they are being purchased by fewer households and by people who already own a gun(s),\" Bennett said in an e-mail. However, several people involved in Lebanon County's gun industry said there is steady demand for new gun owner training classes, and that middle-aged and retired women are one of the most interested demographics. Does owning a firearm keep you safer? Andrew Patrick, spokesman for the Coalition to End Gun Violence, also said it is difficult to tell whether first-time gun purchases are really rising - and if they aren't, he thinks that's a good thing. \"The studies we've seen over and over against indicate that buying a gun is more likely to be harmful to members of the family and the person than to harm an intruder,\" Patrick said. People living in homes with guns are 90 percent more likely to die of homicides than people in other homes, according to a 2004 story in the American Journal of Epidemiology, and they are also more likely to die of suicide. Gun ownership may also not make people safer. A comparison study of 27 developed countries published in the October 2013 edition of the American Journal of Medicine found that countries with more guns per capita had more firearm-related deaths, but did not have reduced overall crime rates. Kalbach, however, said the idea of banning all semi-automatic pistols and rifles would make the possibility of using your weapon for self-defense far more difficult. One of the most likely alternatives would be a revolver, which is limited to six bullets. \"If you've got three people who are breaking into your house, and they're high on PCP, you'd better be accurate with those 5-6 bullets,\" he said. Gun advocates also said those people who accidentally shoot themselves or others are simply not using their weapon safely. If proper techniques like always checking if a gun is loaded when first holding it and keeping the muzzle pointed in a safe location are followed, such accidents shouldn't happen, said Vic Buus Jr., a certified National Rifle Association pistol instructor who teaches classes with the Palmyra Sportsmen's Association. Experience and training Still, several gun sellers agreed that the possibility of accidental shootings or being ineffective with the weapon in a defensive emergency are good arguments for getting safety training. A person who buys a gun without training is no more likely to be able to defend themselves than they are to buy a guitar and become Jimmy Page, Wier said. \"Instead of buying a super-expensive handgun, buy a good, reliable handgun for less money and spend the rest of your budget on training, because the experience and the training is what helps you defend yourself,\" Kalbach said. Both Wier and Shyda said people sometimes come into the gun stores looking to buy a semi-automatic weapon they don't even know how to operate. While people often take offense at being asked why they are purchasing a gun, there are more subtle ways to encourage them to take a safety class, Wier said. Like driving a car, the more experience you have, the more likely you are to operate a firearm properly in an emergency, Good said. \"Now, who knows what I will do in that moment,\" he said. \"I hope that in that moment I make the right decision, my muscle memory kicks in, and I'm able to either take that shot or, more importantly, not take that shot if I don't have to - because that is an absolute last resort.\"",

            "article_content": "Gum disease may cause more than just bad breath, according to a new study presented at the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research meeting, which points to a connection between periodontal disease as a potential early marker for pancreatic cancer. This could pave the way for early detection of pancreatic cancer \u2013 one of the most deadly forms of the disease \u2013because of the advanced stage at which it is often diagnosed. It is estimated that in 2016, 53,070 new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed with only 7.7 percent of victims surviving 5 years. Researchers from New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center with a grant from the National Cancer Institute, found people with two types of periodontal disease-causing oral bacteria have a higher prevalence of pancreatic cancer than those who did not have the gum disease. The two types of periodontal disease bacteria the research team found were Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Saliva samples came from 361 individuals who developed pancreatic cancer and samples from 371 matched healthy individuals in large-scale, long-term prospective cohort studies. The DNA extracted from the saliva was sequenced, and variances in age, race, sex, smoking status, alcohol use, body mass index and diabetes were controlled. Participants with Porphyromonas gingivalis in the microbiome of their oral cavity had a 59 percent greater risk of pancreatic cancer than participants who did not have it. The association of participants with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was not as statistically significant even though they had at least a 50 percent increased relative risk of developing pancreatic cancer. These findings support the current study\u2019s hypothesis and previous research showing that people who have developed pancreatic cancer tended to have poor oral health. The researchers reasoned that periodontitis, which is inflammation of the tissue around the teeth often causing shrinkage of the gums and loosening of the teeth, is due to oral bacteria dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is a term for an unhealthy change in the normal bacterial ecology of a part of the body, such as the mouth. Many previous studies have shown a strong relationship between associated periodontal disease with pancreatic cancer..  Findings from a 2013 European prospective cohort study showed having high levels of P gingivalis antibodies in blood caused a 2-fold increase of developing pancreatic cancer. Another 2007 prospective cohort study looked at over 50,000 male health professionals with a history of periodontitis and found a 64 percent increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Both of these previous studies however, were unable to determine which came first, poor oral health or pancreatic cancer. This new study from NYU is the first study to determine that periodontal dysbiosis does in fact precede the development of pancreatic cancer and does not develop after the diagnosis. This was determined by looking at the oral samples of saliva collected prior to the onset of pancreatic cancer confirming the positive association with P gingivalis. Researchers pointed out that this finding does not confirm that the two periodontal disease-causing bacteria cause pancreatic cancer. Rather, they most likely correlate it with systemic inflammation occurring within the body, known to be a precursor for developing cancer. Having periodontal disease-causing bacteria in the mouth may increase the likelihood of inflammation. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer The pancreas is located deep within the abdomen sandwiched between the stomach and the spine, with a small portion of it nestled in the curve of the upper portion of the small intestine. It functions as a glandular organ having an essential role in converting the food we eat into fuel for the body\u2019s cells. It has an exocrine function of secreting digestive enzymes into the small intestine helping with digestion, and an endocrine function of releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream, a critical controller of blood sugar levels. Tumors of the pancreas are rarely palpable, which is why most symptoms of pancreatic cancer do not appear until the tumor has grown large enough to interfere with the functioning of the pancreas, or has spread to other nearby organs such as the stomach, liver, or gallbladder. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include: Risk factors which may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer include: Future additional studies are planned to determine if periodontal disease is a cause of pancreatic cancer. Until then, good oral hygiene including regular brushing and flossing of the teeth and visits to a dentist are recommended. If a person does have periodontal disease, they should be seen regularly by a periodontist for regular cleanings and checkups to get the condition under control. Anyone who has any of the potential symptoms of pancreatic cancer should make an appointment with their physician for an evaluation and testing as soon as possible.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee suggests the presidential election is being rigged Donald Trump would not commit Wednesday night to accepting the results of the presidential election if he loses on Nov. 8, in a striking moment during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that underscored the deepening tensions in the race \u2013 as the bitter rivals defined the choice for voters on an array of issues not three weeks from Election Day. The debate in Las Vegas, moderated by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, started with a measured discussion on policy disputes ranging from gun rights to abortion to immigration. But it ended with the candidates hurling a grab-bag of accusations and insults at each other. Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman.\u201d Clinton called Trump the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d person to run for president in modern history. The most pointed moment came when Trump \u2013 who for weeks has warned of a \u201crigged\u201d election \u2013 was asked whether he will commit to accept the results of the election. \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d Trump said, citing his concerns about voter registration fraud, a \u201ccorrupt media\u201d and an opponent he claimed \u201cshouldn\u2019t be allowed to run\u201d because she committed a \u201cvery serious crime\u201d with her emails. Pressed again whether he\u2019s prepared to concede if he loses, Trump again said: \u201cI will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d Clinton delivered a sharp rejoinder: \u201cThat\u2019s horrifying.\u201d \u201cThat is not the way our democracy works,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is denigrating, he\u2019s talking down our democracy and I for one am appalled.\u201d Trump responded by calling the Justice Department\u2019s handling of her email probe \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d The exchange was among many contentious moments at Wednesday\u2019s debate, which covered several issues including the national debt that have gotten little attention in the race so far \u2013 but flared with arguments between the candidates over WikiLeaks, over Russia, over the Clinton Foundation and over women\u2019s allegations of groping against Trump. Through the thicket of accusations and personal animus \u2013 they never shook hands on stage \u2013 the candidates tried generally to mount a closing debate-stage argument about experience. \u201cFor 30 years, you\u2019ve been in a position to help. \u2026 The problem is you talk, but you don\u2019t get anything done, Hillary,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you become president, this country is going to be in some mess, believe me.\u201d Clinton countered by contrasting some of her experiences against Trump\u2019s. She said when she was monitoring the Usama bin Laden raid in the Situation Room, \u201cHe was hosting \u2018The Celebrity Apprentice.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019m happy to compare my 30 years of experience \u2026 with your 30 years, and I will let the American people make that decision,\u201d Clinton said. Trump, meanwhile, again disputed the multiple allegations of groping that women have leveled against him since the candidates\u2019 last encounter. He also said he thinks the Clinton campaign is behind the claims, charging, \u201cThey either want fame or her campaign did it.\u201d Clinton said, \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\u201d Trump repeated that \u201cnobody has more respect for women\u201d than him. Trump then shifted to blast the Clinton Foundation as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d He pointed to donations from countries like Saudi Arabia to question Clinton\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s rights. He asked her if she would return money from countries that treat certain \u201cgroups of people horribly,\u201d which she did not answer directly. The candidates\u2019 third and final debate now sets a bitter tone for the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 a race that already stands out as arguably the most personal, caustic and unpredictable White House battle in modern politics. Trump, slipping in the polls amid various campaign controversies, said at the last debate that Clinton should be in jail. Clinton has blasted Trump all along as temperamentally unfit for office. Since the second debate, numerous women have come forward to accuse Trump of groping them, allegations he denies. WikiLeaks also has embarrassed the Clinton campaign by releasing thousands of hacked emails purportedly from her campaign chairman\u2019s account. FBI files alleging a State Department official sought a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to alter the classification on a Clinton server email added to the campaign\u2019s \u2013 and Obama administration\u2019s \u2013 woes. The WikiLeaks controversy came up Wednesday night when Clinton asked if Trump would \u201ccondemn\u201d Russian espionage. He denied knowing Vladimir Putin but said the issue is the Russian president has \u201cno respect\u201d for her. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet,\u201d Clinton shot back. Trump responded, \u201cNope. \u2026 you\u2019re the puppet.\u201d Trump later said he condemns any interference by Russia in the election. The candidates also sparred over gun rights, with the Republican nominee charging that the Second Amendment is \u201cunder absolute siege\u201d and would be eroded if his opponent wins. \u201cWe will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what we have now\u201d if Clinton wins, Trump said. The Democratic nominee countered, \u201cI support the Second Amendment.\u201d In a graphic exchange, Trump said Clinton\u2019s position on abortion is nearing a point where one could \u201crip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month.\u201d Clinton accused him of \u201cscare rhetoric.\u201d They also clashed on immigration, with Trump saying they need to deport \u201cdrug lords\u201d and deal with \u201cbad hombres\u201d in the country. Clinton said violent offenders should be deported but then mocked Trump for not pushing his controversial border wall proposal during his high-profile meeting with the Mexican president. \u201cHe choked,\u201d she said. Trump said Clinton \u201cwanted a wall\u201d when she voted for an immigration overhaul a decade ago \u2013 and now wants \u201copen borders,\u201d which she denied. To date, the mounting controversies facing both campaigns have appeared to hurt Trump more than Clinton, who gradually has expanded her lead over the GOP nominee in recent polls. A Fox News national poll released on the eve of the Las Vegas debate showed Clinton with a 6-point, 45-39 percent lead over Trump in a match-up that includes Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump, in the final three weeks, is thought to be zeroing in on several key battlegrounds including Florida, Ohio and North Carolina \u2013 but the polls suggest his path to the presidency remains narrow, as even once-reliably red states like Texas are being contested by the Clinton campaign.",

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (The Associated Press) BATON ROUGE, La. \u2013 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal appears ready to launch a long-shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination that rests on courtship of evangelical voters and his reputation as a man of ideas. The 44-year-old, two-term governor begins without the national prominence of rivals such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who are among a dozen contenders for the nomination in a highly competitive pack. But Jindal, an Oxford-educated son of Indian immigrants, points to a long political career filled with many unexpected achievements. He talked a governor into appointing him health secretary at age 24 with little background in either health management or government, won election to Congress at 32 and became governor four years later. \"If I were to become a candidate, I would certainly run to win and I would do it based on presenting detailed ideas about how to move our country forward,\" Jindal told reporters recently. His expected campaign launch was scheduled Wednesday afternoon in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner, where Jindal lived as a congressman. Unpopular at home, the Louisiana governor waited until the state legislative session had ended and lawmakers found a way to close a $1.6 billion budget gap before scheduling the announcement. But he has been building his campaign for months with frequent trips to key presidential voting states, particularly Iowa, where he's focused heavily on Christian conservatives. Raised a Hindu but a convert to Catholicism as a teenager, Jindal has talked of his religious faith in small churches across Louisiana. As he readied his presidential campaign, the governor held a prayer rally in Baton Rouge, met pastors across several states and put out an executive order to grant special \"religious freedom\" protections to people in Louisiana who oppose same-sex marriage. He's competing, however, with several contenders trying to appeal to the same pool of evangelical voters, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. As he approached his announcement, Jindal also showcased more of the policy wonk reputation that got him elected governor, rather than focusing solely on the culture wars. He's drawn distinctions from other GOP contenders by noting he's published \"detailed plans\" on health care, defense, education and energy policy. He's suggested governors are better equipped to become president because they've run state bureaucracies, balanced budgets and implemented policy. That's an argument, however, that other White House hopefuls are making or can: Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio, as well as Bush. \"We need somebody who will go to D.C. and rescue the American Dream from becoming the European nightmare,\" Jindal says. All told, a path to victory remains difficult for Jindal. GOP debates begin in August and it's unclear if he will make the cut if based on standing in national polls. What is certain is that the term-limited governor has worn out his welcome back home as his tenure approaches its end in January. Jindal's approval ratings in Louisiana have dropped into the low 30s due to repeated budget cuts to public colleges, near-constant state financial problems and a sense that he's crafted state policy based on his national political ambitions. The governor dismisses the low state poll numbers as a sign he's tackled difficult problems, with large shifts in education policy, dramatic reductions to the public sector workforce and the right-sizing of government. \"Making changes is tough,\" he said in a recent interview. \"It's easy to be a popular politician. If you want to be a popular politician, you kiss babies, you cut ribbons, you don't make tough choices. That's not what I got elected to do.\"",

            "article_content": "FILE - In this Jan. 23, 2014 file photo, the nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box is photographed in Washington. Nutrition facts labels on food packages are getting a long-awaited makeover, with calories listed in bigger, bolder type and a new line for added sugars. (AP Photo/J. David Ake, File) (AP2014) The new Food and Drug Administration guidelines for labels detailing Nutrition Facts are unlikely to make a significant difference in what most people choose to eat for one simple reason: The average consumer does not treat food shopping as a research project. Shopping is a habitual behavior with most decisions made in less than a second, far less time than it takes a consumer to locate, read and process the detailed information on the label. Although good intentions led to the new label rules, it is highly unlikely that the new design will substantially upgrade the quality of the American diet. If anything, they may widen disparities in dietary health, because\u00a0informational approaches favor individuals with a higher level of education and greater financial resources. People who are\u00a0economically stressed\u00a0have a harder time processing such complicated information, research has shown. Instead, choices in the grocery aisle are cued by a\u00a0variety of factors\u00a0that have little to do with information about micronutrients, including placement (eye level, end of aisle or in a promotional display), color of the packaging and images used on it, pricing, discounts and what the consumer is in the habit of buying. Despite an increasing amount of research on decision-making and behavioral economics, the findings used to inform the design of the new Nutrient Facts label were limited and incomplete.\u00a0Research on food choices\u00a0is typically conducted using surveys or in artificial settings with people who are not food shopping -- such as college students, recruits found via the Internet or even attendees of basketball games. These research designs do not include all the complex stimuli and distractions that people have to navigate every time they shop. Research has shown that a shopper\u2019s choice can be influenced by the time of day, how tired or hungry they feel or whether fidgety children are in tow. The first overhaul of nutrition labels in more than 20 years includes such changes as listing \u201cadded sugars\u201d and removing \u201ccalories from fat.\u201d One of the more controversial changes is the adjustment of serving sizes to reflect what Americans actually eat instead of what they should eat. The increase in portion sizes could potentially have negative consequences. For example, a serving of ice cream will grow from one-half cup to two-thirds of a cup under the new standards. Will this upsizing lead people to eat more or less ice cream? Critics have expressed concern that it would increase consumption by creating a new norm, but the FDA says that making more realistic calorie information available will help consumers limit what they eat. But in truth, no one really knows how this change will play out, since the label changes have not been tested in a real world setting. Research has shown that the\u00a0point of purchase\u00a0is the most important risk factor for diet-related chronic diseases. At the checkout counter,\u00a0people are challenged to either follow through on their long-term goals to stay healthy or tempted by impulse-marketing strategies to buy and consume junk foods that can lead to weight gain and increased risk of hypertension, diabetes and cancer. Even those dedicated to a healthy diet can often be undermined by point-of-purchase marketing intended to disrupt cognitive, thoughtful decision-making and promote instant gratification. Because people usually lack insight into how marketing practices interfere with their ability to make good food choices, regulators need to conduct careful research to learn how to protect consumers from such subliminal shopping hazards. To accelerate improvements to the American diet, the U.S. government should invest in efforts aimed at doing research in authentic shopping environments. A series of experimental retail outlets could be created where scientists in many regions would have the opportunity to manipulate the various factors that influence what people buy. Supermarket chains already do this with an eye toward increasing profit, rather than improving health -- and don\u2019t share the findings, saying they are proprietary. To improve dietary health,\u00a0a number of these experimental\u00a0grocery stores\u00a0could\u00a0be established that could provide health researchers with detailed information about consumers\u2019 purchases and simultaneously allow scientists to survey these shoppers about their diets and perceptions of their purchasing decisions. Identifying the risk factors that reduce healthy choices, along with protective factors that increase them, in a food retail environment is key to solving America\u2019s dietary difficulties. Only then can standards and regulations -- and more informative nutrition labels -- be developed that will work in the consumer\u2019s favor, and not against it.",

            "article_content": "Projections have Clinton winning 307 electoral votes, while Trump is set to get 181 Donald Trump\u2019s path to the presidency has narrowed considerably in recent weeks amid campaign trail controversies, with the latest Fox News electoral ratings showing reliably red states coming into play \u2013 a trend that only ups the pressure on the Republican nominee to tilt the race at the third and final presidential debate Wednesday night. The debate in Las Vegas, moderated by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, will mark the last face-off between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the home-stretch of the presidential campaign. Both candidates are dealing with their share of controversies \u2013 Trump, facing multiple allegations of groping dating back decades; and Clinton, grappling with embarrassing revelations from leaked emails and now the allegation in an FBI file that a top State Department official offered a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with the bureau to alter a Clinton server email\u2019s classification. Trump has seized on the latter revelation in the run-up to the debate. But so far, his poll numbers have taken a bigger hit than hers \u2013 and the latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard reflects this. In a significant shift, the scorecard shows the rating for Texas being changed from \u201csolid Republican\u201d to \u201clean Republican.\u201d Trump still appears to have the advantage but his lead over Clinton is now in the single digits in recent state polls \u2013 in a state that hasn\u2019t voted Democrat in the White House race since 1976. Last week, a poll released by the Texas Lyceum showed Trump leading Clinton 39-32 percent among likely voters in the Lone Star State. \"The combination of the slow march of demographic change and Trump's rhetoric appears to have made Texas' registered voter pool more Democratic than we have seen in previous presidential races,\" Joshua Blank, the Texas Lyceum's research director, told The Dallas Morning News. In another poll released Tuesday from the University of Houston, Clinton has pulled within 3 percentage points of Trump in the traditionally Republican stronghold. It\u2019s a stark difference from the 2012 race where GOP nominee Mitt Romney took the state by 16 points. Arizona Sen. John McCain led Barack Obama there by 12 points in 2008. Clinton\u2019s campaign, sensing an opening, has even gone on air in Texas with a one-week ad buy in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio. The ad highlights an endorsement from The Dallas Morning News \u2013 the first time the conservative-leaning newspaper has backed a Democrat for president since 1940. Nearly every major newspaper has backed the Democrat, though, just one factor fueling Trump\u2019s claims that the media are helping \u201crig\u201d the election against him. Trump also says the allegations by numerous women against him are false and the media are only feeding the allegedly erroneous claims. In a potential hint at the candidate\u2019s debate strategy, the Trump campaign came out with a new ad overnight suggesting Clinton helped \u201cspecial interests\u201d during her time in Washington. \u201cHillary Clinton wants you to believe that behind the fog of scandal that shrouds her political career you find results, where in reality all you find is a trail of destruction that has damaged our economy and put American lives at risk,\u201d spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. To watch the debate, tune in at 9 p.m. to Fox News Channel. The debate also will be streamed on\u00a0FoxNews.com\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0Fox News app. The electoral map, though, is looking dicier than ever for Trump. According to the latest Fox News ratings, if Clinton won all the \u201csolid\u201d and \u201clean\u201d Democrat states, she\u2019d have 307 electoral votes \u2013 well over the 270 needed to win. If Trump won all the \u201csolid\u201d and \u201clean\u201d Republican states, he\u2019d have just 181 electoral votes. That means even if he won all the pure \u201ctoss-up\u201d states \u2013 Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah \u2013 and their 50 electoral votes, he\u2019d still be short of 270. \u00a0He\u2019d have to flip some states currently leaning Democrat back into his column. That Utah is now in the \u201ctoss-up\u201d column represents another shift, and another headache for Trump. The Fox News Electoral Scorecard recently shifted Utah from \u201csolid Republican\u201d to \u201ctoss-up.\u201d The New York billionaire no longer has the clear advantage in the state, and is statistically tied in some polls with Clinton and Evan McMullin, an independent candidate who is pitching himself as the conservative alternative to Trump. A poll of likely voters, conducted over the weekend by Rasmussen Reports, shows that 2 points separate the three candidates. For both Clinton and McMullin, it is their best showing in the state in any major poll thus far, and could reflect lost support for Trump among the state\u2019s sizable Mormon population. Following the release of Trump\u2019s infamous 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, a number of top Republicans in the state swiftly pulled their endorsements, including Gov. Gary Herbert who called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cbeyond offensive and despicable.\u201d Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is a Mormon, said if he voted for Trump he would not be able to look his young daughter in the eye. Chris Karpowitz, director of Brigham Young University\u2019s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, told The New York Times that \u201cthe Republican establishment in the state of Utah is in all-out revolt again the Trump candidacy.\u201d The pressure now is on Trump to not only win the toss-up states and turn blue-ish states red, but to prevent states like Utah and Texas from abandoning the Republican ticket for the first time in years. Even Alaska, which is still rated \u201csolid Republican\u201d in the Fox News scorecard, has seen Clinton gaining on Trump in recent polling. The last time Alaska, one of the country\u2019s deepest-red states, voted Democrat was in 1964. Speaking Tuesday night on Fox News' \u201cHannity,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich cast doubt on the polls and predicted Trump would defy them. \u201cI think the polls are as accurate here as they were in Great Britain,\u201d Gingrich quipped. Fox News\u2019 Bryan Murphy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats projected to gain between 10-20 seats, not enough to overturn Republican majority Republicans were projected to retain control of the House and Senate after fending off Democratic challenges across the country on Election Day. Democrats, despite having been optimistic about this year\u2019s chances of retaking the majority in the upper chamber, failed to gain the five seats needed. The Democrats\u2019 candidate beat GOP incumbent Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, as expected, but the party lost most other tight races. As of early Wednesday morning, Republicans were on track to see their 54-46 majority erode only slightly. They could end up with at least 52 seats, according to the AP. MARIJUANA, ASSISTED SUICIDE MEASURES BACKED BY VOTERS Republican as expected also kept control of the House. The GOP entered Election Day with a 59-seat House advantage, so Democrats would have had to gain 30 seats to take control of the chamber. They will instead likely pick up 10 to 20 seats, falling short of majority control. In the bid to control the Senate, Fox News projected the outcomes of several key races including victories for Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, all fending off tough challenges to win reelection. Arizona Sen. John McCain won a sixth term, defeating Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick in a hard-fought race. Kirkpatrick represented McCain's strongest challenge in years, but his prolific fundraising and name recognition proved difficult to overcome Tuesday. In his victory speech, McCain thanked \"my employers, the people of Arizona.\" Portman, Burr, Johnson and Toomey were among a handful of incumbent Republicans whom Democrats had targeted early for defeat -- in their bid to win the Senate majority. \u201cHouse Republicans won tonight thanks to our members\u2019 relentless focus on the issues important to voters in their districts,\" said Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"Both parties have to work together to find common ground,\" Portman said in his victory speech. \"The best way to do that is to get things done. I\u2019ll do everything in my powers to expand opportunity for everybody.\u201d The race in Louisiana for the seat of retiring GOP Sen. David Vitter will as expected go to a run-off. Democrat Foster Campbell and Republican John Kennedy emerged as the top vote-getters in a field of nearly two-dozen candidates. But neither could win more than 50 percent of the vote to win the seat. The only major race that remained too close to call into Wednesday morning was the Senate contest in New Hampshire between GOP incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic challenger Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte is trying to appeal to the state\u2019s notoriously independent electorate while staying loyal to her Washington Republican base and supporters like the National Rifle Association and the billionaire, libertarian-minded Koch Brothers. Ayotte said early that she\u2019d support Trump but did not endorse him. She then called Trump a \u201crole model,\u201d only to retract the statement after another offensive Trump comment, then totally withdrew her support. In North Carolina, Burr defeated Democratic challenger Deborah Ross, to serve a third Senate term. And Johnson beat former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold in a rematch of their 2010 race. In Pennsylvania, Toomey\u00a0defeated Katie McGinty, a former Clinton administration adviser who was handpicked by Washington Democrats. Rubio keeps a Senate seat for Republicans that Democrats had hoped to win after he essentially abandoned the seat for his ultimately-failed presidential bid. However, Rubio re-entered the race in June and held off a tough challenge from Democratic Rep. Tim Murphy to win a second term. Republicans also held onto the Senate seat of retiring Indiana GOP senator Dan Coats. Rep. Todd Young kept the seat by fending off a strong, surprise challenge from former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh, who muscled into the race in mid-July. But in Illinois, incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk was defeated by Democratic challenger Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Kirk was considered the most vulnerable Republican senator in the 2016 election cycle. Duckworth is a veteran who lost both of her legs in the Iraq War. Kirk, a first-term senator who served in Congress for nearly 15 years, was seeking reelection in Democrat-leaning Illinois. He dimmed his comeback chances last month by insulting Duckworth\u2019s Thai ancestry. \u201cI'm here because of the miracles that occurred 12 years ago ... \u00a0\u2026 in a dusty field in Iraq,\u201d Duckworth told supporters afterward. \u201cSome I can explain, like the bravery of my crew. And some I cannot, like the shrapnel from the explosion passing through my helicopter spinning rotor blades and not destroy it, allowing us to land. \u2026 I live every day trying to honor you.\u201d Democrats liked their chances of retaking the Senate practically within days of losing the majority in 2014 -- considering they had to defend just 10 incumbents, compared to Republicans who would have to spend far more money and other resources to protect 24 sitting senators. Republicans had a very short 2016 wish list -- take the seat of arch-political rival Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, the retiring top Senate Democrat. Republicans had a top-tier competitor in Rep. Joe Heck. But all of the resources they put into the race couldn't defeat Democratic nominee Catherine Cortez Masto or change the fact that Nevada is a liberal-leaning state anchored by the Las Vegas area, home to a large Hispanic population, which\u00a0overwhelmingly supports Democratic candidates. In Ohio, GOP Gov. John Kasich\u2019s refusal to support Donald Trump made Portman\u2019s task of winning a second term even tougher. But the state\u2019s older, solidly-white population and a lackluster performance by Democrat challenger and former Gov. Ted Strickland gave Portman the win, after having built a nearly 20-point lead before polls opened Tuesday. Republicans pulled out a win in Missouri, but it took incumbent GOP Sen. Roy Blunt the political fight of his life. He defeated\u00a0Missouri\u00a0Secretary of State Jason Kander, an upstart Democrat with military experience who can assemble an AR-15 blindfolded. In Indiana, Republicans had a solid candidate in Young, a three-term House member. But Bayh\u2019s surprise decision to enter the race -- with a $10 million war chest -- made it much more competitive and expensive. The race remains surprisingly close until the end, amid disclosures about Bayh\u2019s profitable connections to K Street and Wall Street. \"When I grew up here in Indiana, my dad told me almost every day, 'If I worked really hard, good things would happen.' Well dad, this is a good thing,\" Young, a former Marine, said after the race. \"Tonight was a great victory, not for me, but for the state of Indiana.\" Republicans didn\u2019t expect such a hyper-competitive race in North Carolina. But Ross, a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer and state representative, had little state-wide name recognition. Toomey's challeger in Pennsylvania was Katie McGinty, among the handful of 2016 Democratic candidates whom political analysts said ran an uninspiring race. The Pennsylvania race was essentially deadlocked since the start of the election cycle. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Man arrested four times in two years The federal government can tell you how many \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\" stole a car, the precise number of \"American Indian or Alaska Natives\" who were arrested for vagrancy or how many whites were busted for counterfeiting in any given year. But the government agencies that crunch crime numbers are utterly unable -- or unwilling -- to pinpoint for the public how many illegal immigrants are arrested within U.S. borders each year. In the absence of comprehensive data, FoxNews.com examined a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics that revealed a wildly disproportionate number of murderers, rapists and drug dealers are crossing into the U.S. amid the wave of hard-working families seeking a better life. The explosive figures show illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their 3.5-percent share of the U.S. population would suggest. Critics say it is no accident that local, state and federal governments go to great lengths to keep the data under wraps. \"There are a lot of reasons states don\u2019t make this information readily available, and there is no clearinghouse of data at high levels,\" said former Department of Justice attorney J. Christian Adams, who has conducted exhaustive research on the subject. \"These numbers would expose how serious the problem is and make the government look bad.\u201d \u201cThey should have been sent back to their home country instead of being allowed to stay here and have the opportunity to kill Americans.\u201d Adams called illegal immigrant crime a \"wave of staggering proportions.\" He and other experts noted that the issue has been dragged into the spotlight by a spate of cases in which illegal immigrants with criminal records killed people after being released from custody because of incoherent procedures and a lack of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement officials. The murders, including the July 1 killing of Kathryn Steinle, allegedly by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco, have left grieving loved ones angry and confused, local and federal officials pointing fingers at one another and the voting public demanding secure borders and swift deportation of non-citizen criminals. San Francisco shooting suspect Francisco Sanchez and victim Kathryn Steinle are shown in this composite photo. (Associated Press) \u201cEvery one [of the recent cases] was preventable through better border security and enforcing immigration laws,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cThey should have been sent back to their home country instead of being allowed to stay here and have the opportunity to kill Americans.\u201d A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement told FoxNews.com that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrant crime are not available from the federal government, and suggested contacting county, state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally, a process that would encompass thousands of local departments. FoxNews.com did review reports from immigration reform groups and various government agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Sentencing Commission, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Government Accountability Office, the Bureau of Justice Statistics and several state and county correctional departments. Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants. Critics say better border security is needed to keep illegal immigrants out, but those caught committing crimes here must be imprisoned and deported. (AP) (Reuters) There are approximately 2.1 million legal or illegal immigrants with criminal convictions living free or behind bars in the U.S., according to ICE's Secure Communities office. Each year, about 900,000 legal and illegal immigrants are arrested, and 700,000 are released from jail, prison, or probation. ICE estimates that there are more than 1.2 million criminal aliens at large in the U.S. In the most recent figures available, a Government Accountability Office report titled, \"Criminal Alien Statistics,\" found there were 55,000 illegal immigrants in federal prison and 296,000 in state and local lockups in 2011. Experts agree those figures have almost certainly risen, although executive orders from the Obama administration may have changed the status of thousands who previously would have been counted as illegal immigrants. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals are being deported. In 2014, ICE removed 315,943 criminal illegal immigrants nationwide, 85 percent of whom had previously been convicted of a criminal offense. But that same year, ICE released onto U.S. streets another 30,558 criminal illegal immigrants with a combined 79,059 criminal convictions including 86 homicides, 186 kidnappings, and thousands of sexual assaults, domestic violence assaults and DUIs, Vaughan said. As of August, ICE had already released at least 10,246 criminal aliens. David Inserra, a policy analyst for Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at The Heritage Foundation, said letting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes go free while they await deportation hearings is putting the public at risk. \u201cWhile it is not certain how many of these individuals were here illegally, most of these individuals were in deportation proceedings and should have been detained or at least more closely supervised and monitored until their deportation order was finalized and executed,\u201d Inserra said. Adams opened a rare window into the dearth of public data when he obtained an internal report compiled by the Texas Department of Public Safety and revealed its contents on his Pajamas Media blog. The report showed that between 2008 and 2014, noncitizens in Texas -- a group that includes illegal and legal immigrants -- committed 611,234 crimes, including nearly 3,000 homicides. Adams told FoxNews.com that other states have also closely tracked illegal immigrant crime, especially in the wake of 9/11, but said the statistical sorting \u201cis done behind closed doors.\u201d States closely guard the statistics out of either fear of reprisals from the federal government or out of their leaders' own insistence on downplaying the burden of illegal immigrant crime, he said. \"There are a lot of reasons states don\u2019t make this information readily available and there is no clearinghouse of data at high levels,\" Adams said. \"These numbers would expose how serious the problem is and make the government look bad.\" Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, (l.), and Jose Fernando Villagomez, (r.), allegedly broke into the home of Marilyn Pharis on July 24. (Santa Maria Police Department) A smattering of statistics can be teased out of data made public in other states heavily impacted by illegal immigration, although a full picture or apples-to-apples comparison remains elusive. \u25a0 In Florida, there were 5,061 illegal immigrant inmates in state prison facilities as of June 30, but neither the state Department of Corrections nor the Florida Department of Law Enforcement track the number in county prisons, spokesmen for those agencies told FoxNews.com. \u25a0 In Illinois, where state prisons house 46,993 inmates, some 3,755 are illegal immigrants, according to Illinois Department of Corrections figures. Once again, state officials do not compile figures for county jails, although a Cook County official estimated that nearly 6 percent were illegal immigrants. \u25a0 In Arizona, neither state public safety officials nor the governor\u2019s office could produce figures showing the number of criminal illegal immigrants held in county jails, but state prison figures released by the Arizona Department of Corrections show out of 42,758 prisoners held in state facilities in July, about 10.8 percent were illegal immigrants. \u25a0 In California, there were 128,543 inmates in custody as of Aug. 12, but the state, which has been criticized for its leniency toward illegal immigrants, no longer keeps track of the citizenship status of inmates. As of July 31, 2013, the last time figures were documented, there were as many as 18,000 \u201cforeign-born\u201d citizens in California state prisons of 133,000 incarcerated. The Board of State and Community Corrections provided figures to Fox News from 2014, showing there were 142,000 inmates in 120 county prisons, but while everything from mental health cases to dental and medical appointments are closely tracked, the number of illegal aliens -- or even non citizens -- is not. \u201cFrankly, this is something every state should track, but they don\u2019t. Not even ICE publishes this much information on offenders and immigration status,\u201d Vaughan said. Several pro-immigration groups contacted by FoxNews.com declined to comment on the outsize role illegal immigrants play in the U.S. criminal justice system. One group that did insisted that even illegal immigrants provide a net benefit to the U.S. \u201cImmigrants, regardless of their legal status, make valuable contributions to our economy as workers, business owners, taxpayers and consumers,\u201d said Erin Oshiro, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. \u201cWe need an immigration system that that keeps families together, protects workers, and prioritizes due process and human rights.\"",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in The media are giving their official blessing to Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice of Tim Kaine, praising him as a calm, experienced and slightly dull guy who can help her govern. What they are not doing is picking the Virginia senator apart, and highlighting his disagreements with the nominee, which marked the coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s selection of Mike Pence. I happen to think that both Kaine and Pence are solid and serious choices who share some similarities, as both are religious and make little attempt to be flashy. But different media standards seem to apply. Of course, Trump\u2019s veepstakes was a roller-coaster ride that attracted relentless coverage as he tried to decide among Pence, Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich, at one point second-guessing himself. Clinton\u2019s process was deadly dull\u2014Kaine was always the front-runner, despite some buzz for Tom Vilsack and the press playing up Elizabeth Warren\u2014and even the way she texted the choice on Friday night seemed to mute the coverage. Pence may be an avid Christian, sitting governor and ex-congressman, but many of the accounts examined him in terms of drawing evangelical votes, differing with Trump on immigration and how his low-key personality doesn\u2019t match the Trump brand. If the media took a similarly adversarial approach on the Democratic side, they would be demanding to know how Kaine can run with Clinton when, as a Catholic, he is personally opposed to abortion and the death penalty. (He follows the law on both subjects.) The Weekly Standard has a piece on how Kaine supports the Hyde amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion, and how he deflected a question on efforts to oppose that amendment in the party\u2019s platform. But that story isn\u2019t getting much traction. The same goes for Kaine\u2019s position on free trade, which is more traditionally supportive, as Clinton was until Bernie Sanders pushed her to the left. It so happens that Kaine chose Saturday to come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, joining his running mate. Haven\u2019t seen any flip-flop stories. And Kaine\u2019s stance on banking regulation is more favorable to the industry than Hillary\u2019s. Why is the press not pounding away at that? MSNBC has been hailing the choice, and reporting favorable tidbits: He gave a Senate speech in Spanish! He won a spelling bee! He plays the harmonica! The New York Times introduces the former Virginia governor and Richmond mayor by saying that \u201cMr. Kaine has deftly managed his own rise as a progressive in a bastion of Southern conservatism.\u201d He is \u201cdriven by Jesuit ideals.\u201d The abortion and death penalty questions are dealt with in a sympathetic way: \u201cHe gets an F rating from the National Rifle Association, but a perfect score from Planned Parenthood, despite his personal opposition to abortion, which he says is a matter of his Roman Catholic faith.\u201d In the past, when \u201cMr. Kaine\u2019s opposition to the death penalty became a central issue. Mr. Kaine managed to deflect it with an ad in which he stared into the camera and declared his position a matter of faith; he won 52 percent of the vote.\u201d Another Times story said that \u201cin selecting Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate, Hillary Clinton is sending the clearest signal yet that she is confident she will win the presidential election\u2026His value is almost entirely about governing \u2014 about what he can do for Mrs. Clinton in the White House rather than at the ballot box.\u201d Do you recall many references to Pence helping Trump govern? The Washington Post says Kaine is \u201ccompleting a Democratic ticket that prizes experience and traditional notions of public service in a political year dominated by Republican rival Donald Trump\u2019s unorthodox, highly personal brand of leadership\u2026 \u201cKaine\u2019s affable, regular-guy presence may also help balance the perception of Clinton as remote, chilly and privileged.\u201d Virginia is part of the Post\u2019s turf, and the paper deserves credit for two more skeptical pieces. One is on left-wing groups not liking the pick: \u201cSeveral organizations, including some with ties to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the runner-up in the Democratic primaries, sharply questioned Kaine\u2019s liberal bona fides, pointing to Kaine\u2019s support of trade deals and regulations favorable to big banks.\u201d The other is something that Kaine did as governor and lieutenant governor that was legal but smells awful: accepting $160,000 in gifts, including an $18,000 Caribbean vacation and $5,500 in clothing. Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell was later convicted for accepting gifts from a businessman seeking favors, but that was overturned by the Supreme Court. While there have been media mentions about Kaine\u2019s gift-grabbing, they tend to be framed as criticism from the other side, as in this Post piece: \u201cRepublicans have signaled in recent days that they will use Kaine\u2019s acceptance of that and other freebies as a line of attack against the newly selected vice presidential candidate, looking to stoke concern among Democrats that Kaine is not the progressive candidate they had hoped for.\u201d Politico loved his Florida speech\u2014\u201cKaine Brings Down the House in Miami\u201d\u2014and also offers this upbeat assessment: \u201cIn Kaine \u2014 a politician who has never lost a race, whose name has topped Clinton\u2019s list of potential running mates since the process began in earnest back in April \u2014 the former secretary of state picked a partner who is similarly heavy on experience and light on dynamic political charisma. The hope, Democrats said, is that the Clinton-Kaine ticket will underscore to voters the value of a steady, dependable hand, at home and abroad, when contrasted against the inconsistent and mercurial Donald Trump.\u201d Everyone says Kaine is boring\u2014he pleaded guilty to that charge on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d\u2014but in the current hyperpartisan environment, boring translates into pretty placid coverage.",

            "article_content": "Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is a neurological condition that can make simple things like sound or touch become overwhelming. Young children can learn coping strategies in sensory gyms, but what about teens living with the condition? When Joanne Sciortino brought her 8-month-old daughter Victoria home from a Russian orphanage, she knew something wasn\u2019t quite right. \"From immediately being on the train and watching her rock herself in such a violent way\u2014 you knew she was trying to calm her body,\u201d Joanne told FoxNews.com. At 15 months old, Victoria Sciortino underwent early interventional testing and was clinically diagnosed with sensory processing disorder, or SPD. SPD is a neurological condition that causes the brain to process stimuli differently, and the condition has three subtypes. First, there\u2019s sensory modulation disorder, wherein people have certain sensory cravings, or may be oversensitive or under-sensitive to stimuli such as hearing and touch. Other individuals may suffer from\u00a0sensory discrimination disorder, which causes people to have difficulty distinguishing between sensory messages, like not being able to tell if a food is too sweet or salty, or understanding the tone of a funny joke. Last, there\u2019s sensory-based motor disorder, which is marked by having problems moving or planning a sequence of movements like balancing and riding a bike. \u201cThe brains and bodies of people with sensory challenges are wired differently,\u201d Lindsey Biel, a New York City based occupational therapist and author of \u201cSensory Processing Challenges; Effective Clinical Work with Kids & Teens,\u201d told FoxNews.com. \u201cCertain sensory signals might come in too loud or too softly. If the information is not coming in a reliable, accurate way\u2014 or feels uncomfortable or painful in that person\u2019s body\u2014 it\u2019s going to interfere with function, and that\u2019s when we start to talk about disorder.\u201d Studies suggest between 5 and 13 percent of preschool children are affected by SPD. However, SPD is not recognized as a disorder in standard medical manuals like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), in which more well-known disorders like depression and schizophrenia exist. Some experts believe SPD isn\u2019t a separate condition, but a symptom of other ailments like autism or ADHD. Sophie Molholm, an associate professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, has been working on new research with a group of pure-SPD\u00a0types (those who don\u2019t have any other conditions like autism), to measure their brain activity and see if there are any major differences in sensory input and how they put together sensory input. Her preliminary evidence suggests children with SPD have a larger brain response to sensory stimulation than an age-match control group. \u201cBut we can\u2019t say why at this point,\u201d Molholm told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s very tempting to say something like, \u2018This is either the brain amplifying the response or failing to dampen the response,\u2019 but that would be purely speculative. We still have a lot more work to do.\u201d For Victoria, challenges include an oversensitivity to touch. As a child, she refused to hold her mother's hand, and she continues to only wear soft and fuzzy fabrics because anything tight or scratchy agitates her. She also has vestibular challenges that make her crave constant movement, and she is hypersensitive to sound at certain pitch levels. When Victoria was in grade school, fire alarms caused her physical pain. \u201cI used to be terrified of going to school just in case a fire drill went off,\u201d Victoria told FoxNews.com. \u201cI was young, so I didn\u2019t know what was going on other than it was loud and painful. In order to get away from the overloaded stimuli, I used to hide in closets at school in my kindergarten classroom.\u201d While there is no known cause or cure for SPD, it's often managed through occupational therapy (OT) using a sensory integration approach (OT-SI). OT sessions typically begin with an initial assessment including a sensory challenge questionnaire to uncover which senses are problematic, followed by sensory-modulating activities to reduce the patient\u2019s over-reactivity to sensory input. For children, this can include wheelbarrow walking, arts and crafts, or resting with weighted blankets. But having playtime in sensory-type gyms is not always appropriate for older children and teens, so different tactics are needed as they age. \u201cThere is a lot of cognitive work involved when you\u2019re older. Mostly it\u2019s physical activities that change the neurological system,\u201d Carol Kranowitz, author of \u201cThe Out of Sync Child Grows Up,\u201d told FoxNews.com. \u201cThey need heavy work activities, so sports are helpful; swimming, track, martial arts is good for kids who don\u2019t want to be touched.\u201d Victoria started OT work with Biel twice a week when she was 15 months old. Biel taught Joanne and Victoria how to recognize when Victoria\u2019s senses were starting to overload and mechanisms to help soothe her. Victoria stopped her OT work with Biel six years later, when her family moved to Scarsdale, New York. But as Victoria entered adolescence, she soon discovered that horseback riding was just the type of sensory solution she needed. Horseback riding forced Victoria to control her body, process multistep directions and destress. \"It\u2019s helped me get that sensation of kind of being able to relax and breathe for a bit, and not have to worry about everything else going on, because at that moment it's just you and the horse,\" Victoria said. Long-term OT-SI goals are aimed at teaching people how to self-regulate when their senses become overwhelmed. \"By the time a child is school-aged, [in] middle school, certainly a teenager, I want that child to be able to self-advocate. To really have the self-knowledge to say, \u2018This hard for me\u2019, \u2018This is what I can do,\u2019 \u2018This is how I can overcome it,\u2019\" Biel said. While some doctors and school teachers remain skeptical about SPD and claim that some kids are just fussy or shy, Joanne says the most important thing to remember as a parent is to trust yourself. \"You\u2019ll still get a lot of pushback because SPD isn\u2019t in a classified [medical] listing yet, but the effects on your child\u2014 and how it affects them day to day and in school and in relationships\u2014 is very real,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "President-elect speaks to the nation from New York City Donald Trump, defying the pundits and polls to the end, defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election and claimed an establishment-stunning victory that exposes the depth of voter dissatisfaction \u2013 and signals immense changes ahead for American policy at home and abroad. Seventeen months after the billionaire tycoon\u2019s Trump Tower entrance into the race, the first-time candidate once dismissed by the political elite will become the 45th\u00a0president, Fox News projects. Speaking to cheering supporters early Wednesday morning at his victory party in New York City, the Republican candidate and now president-elect said Clinton called to congratulate him, and Fox News confirms she has conceded. Despite their hard-fought campaign, Trump praised Clinton for her service and said \u201cit is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d \u201cI will be president for all Americans,\u201d Trump vowed, after a brief introduction by running mate Mike Pence. TRUMP'S AGENDA: WHAT HIS ELECTION MEANS FOR AMERICA Sounding a call to \u201creclaim our country\u2019s destiny,\u201d Trump declared: \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \u2026 America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.\u201d Trump will be the oldest president in U.S. history, entering the Oval Office at age 70. With her defeat, Clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the United States. Though Clinton called Trump, her campaign initially did not concede defeat. Earlier, her campaign chairman John Podesta addressed supporters nearby in New York and said several states were \u201ctoo close to call.\u201d Clinton herself did not appear at the rally. Podesta had urged supporters to \u201chead home\u201d and said they would not have \u201canything more to say tonight.\u201d Amid Trump\u2019s victory, Republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the House and Senate, improving Trump\u2019s chances of advancing his agenda in office. A surge of support in key battlegrounds \u2013 and especially surprise victories in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 helped propel Trump to victory. The GOP nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Iowa. Clinton won her share of battlegrounds, including Virginia and Nevada and Colorado, but could not make up for Trump\u2019s strong performance in other states thought to favor the Democrat. The billionaire businessman\u2019s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround, after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be \u201crigged\u201d against him. Clinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into Tuesday\u2019s vote, yet the polls had been tightening in the race\u2019s closing days. His victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor \u2013 and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race. Without question, his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent. Eleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton\u2019s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but the political damage may have been done. And the WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Podesta\u2019s account became a constant distraction for the campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal concerns about the Clinton family\u2019s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries. This at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump that came out in October (which he denies), following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women. Trump\u2019s victory marks the second time Clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female U.S. president, having been defeated by President Obama in their 2008 primary race. But Trump has been able to defy expectations from the start. He defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the Republican primaries \u2013 stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider, populist message; throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates; and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable, learn-as-he-goes campaign style. He also defied party orthodoxy, railing against free-trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership and staking out a sometimes-confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve. Democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow. Trump was aided by the infrastructure of the GOP, but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by Clinton. While she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high-powered surrogates, Trump\u2019s campaign was driven mainly by him, an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers. Surrogates like retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani advocated aggressively for the Republican nominee, but he remained at odds with many influential elected Republicans who in some cases \u2013 as with House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 endorsed him, but only reluctantly. His stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals \u2013 including variations on a plan to suspend Muslim immigration from certain countries \u2013 also made party brass uncomfortable. The late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional Republicans to abandon him entirely. But even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding Trump, whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee\u2019s tensions with the GOP establishment and saw him as the true change-maker in the election.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, left, reacts as she takes the stage at a rally, Monday, June 6, 2016, in Long Beach, Calif. Eight years after conceding she was unable to \"shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling,\" Hillary Clinton is embracing her place in history as she finally crashes through as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. (AP Photo/John Locher) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) The results of Tuesday nights six primaries shocked many, in particular Bernie Sanders supporters who were convinced that their candidate was going to take the big prize in California. They had good reason for being optimistic, in the weeks leading up to the election Sanders criss-crossed the state, holding multiple rallies in a single day and drawing crowds in the tens of thousands. Moreover the polls showed the race tightening to within two percentage points in the final weeks, so much so that Hillary Clinton cancelled a fundraiser and headed out to California earlier than expected. Given Sanders momentum and the energy behind its campaign, the results were a blow to his fervent supporters, many of whom are still trying to make sense of what happened. The following five numbers help explain Tuesday's results and the state of the Democratic race today. 1. 2/3 vote early The Field Poll predicted that roughly two-thirds of Californians cast their ballots by mail or through early voting. If that turns out to be the case, it goes a long way towards helping to explain Hillary Clinton\u2019s sizable 12 percent victory in The Golden State. How so? Early voting times vary by county but began roughly thirty days before the election. At that time, most polls showed Clinton had a double-digit lead. Polls taken by Hoover/Golden State, KABC/Survey USA and the LA Times/USC beginning about a month prior to the election had Clinton leading Bernie Sanders by 10 to 19 percentage points. The more time Sander spent in the state and the closer we got to election day, however, her lead in most polls (Field, NBC/WSJ/Marist, CBS News/YouGov) shrank to 2 percent or well within the margin of error. 2. 18,000,000 new voters Last night heard a lot of references to Clinton\u2019s 2008 statement that her former and ill-fated run for the White House hadn\u2019t shattered the glass ceiling but instead had put 18 million cracks in it. While that is certainly worth remembering, another 18 million also worth nothing is the number of new voters who registered to vote in California\u2019s Tuesday primary. According to state officials, 650,000 new voters registered to participate in the last two months alone. And this is not a phenomena that is unique to California by any means, it is a story that has played out in most states across the country throughout this hard fought election cycle and across both sides of the aisle as new voters have come into the process in droves. 3. 83 percent Hillary Clinton won four states last night (California, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota) to Bernie Sanders two (Montana and North Dakota). More importantly, however, Clinton did something she has been doing throughout the primary and caucus season she won the biggest, most delegate rich states. California and New Jersey combined had 656 delegates up for grabs, Clinton not only won both those states but two others as well. Compare that with the states Sanders won which had a combined delegate count of just 37. If you want to understand why Clinton is the presumptive nominee of the party, the fact is she not only won more states (33) more votes (well over 3 million), more pledged and super delegates, but the states she won were the largest and most delegate rich. Of the 12 states with more than 100 delegates up for grabs on the Democratic side this season, she won 10 or 83 percent. If you consider the 30 states with more than 50 delegates, she won 20 of those or two-thirds. Either way, when the game is winning delegates, particularly pledged, Clinton trounced Sanders in the biggest most delegate rich states of them all. 4. 903 delegates After Tuesday nights\u2019 romp by Clinton, this is the number of delegates Sanders is behind. This means even if he wooed half of Clinton\u2019s 571 super-delegates (285) to his side and won all of the remaining pledged delegates (45) \u2013 both of which are near impossible scenarios \u2013 nevertheless, even then he would still be over 200 delegates shy of reaching the 2383 delegates necessary to capture the nomination. Put another way \u2013 Sanders is much farther behind Clinton than she was trailing Obama in 2008 when she decided to end her campaign. At that time, Clinton was just 69 delegates behind Obama and actually led him by 273,000 popular votes. The math is the math and it leads to what has to be the million dollar question coming out of the contests last night, when will Sanders drop his bid? He said last night that he will fight on until at least the last contest in Washington D.C. next Tuesday. Then came word of another call with President Obama who will surely join the chorus of elected Democratic officials urging and cajoling him to get out of the race for the good of the party, as well as reports that Sanders is going to being laying off at least half of his staff. Mathematically, if the writing was on the wall for Clinton in 2008, you have to say the same is true for Sanders. The one major difference being, Clinton wanted a future in the party and planned to run again, Sanders has no such ambitions which make it harder for the party to make him a deal he cant refuse. 5. 144 years It has been 144 years since Victoria Woodhull became the first female candidate for president of the United States. It has been 96 years since the 19th amendment was ratified giving women the right to vote. And it has been exactly 100 years since Jeannette Rankin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first woman to be elected to national office in the country. There are a lot of other female \u201cfirsts\u201d we can point to. And certainly last night, when Hillary Clinton officially became the first female to be selected as the nominee of a major party, is in keeping with these other historic moments. The Clinton campaign did everything they could to highlight the moment, playing a moving video montage before their candidate came on to the dais to speak last night. It may take a lot more education of this kind to remind an important sector of the electorate of the history of the moment. Ironically as Clinton bathes in this historic moment, she has to be cognizant that throughout the campaign she has struggled with one group in particular \u2013 not just young people, but young women. Throughout the primary season Sanders has beat Clinton by as much as 60 points among young voters and Clinton lost young women by about 30 percent. It is a baffling reality in a tumultuous primary that the Clinton team is going to have to address as the move into the general election.",

            "article_content": "'Megyn Kelly Presents': Presumptive Republican presidential nominee on his conduct on the campaign trail Donald Trump, in an extensive interview with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, responded to critics of his barbed campaign style by saying he never would have been successful in the primary race if he had acted \u201cpresidential\u201d and held back on hitting his political rivals \u2013 while declaring that if he doesn\u2019t win the election this fall, he\u2019ll consider his campaign a \u201ccomplete waste.\u201d The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was blunt in describing the stakes of the 2016 race as he sees it. Without a victory in the fall, he said, he won\u2019t be able to lower taxes, strengthen the military or \u201cmake America great.\u201d \u201cI will say this: If I don\u2019t go all the way, and if I don\u2019t win, I will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time, energy and money,\u201d Trump said, in the interview that aired Tuesday night on Fox Broadcast Network affiliates. The candidate addressed a range of topics in his sit-down with Kelly, from his tone to the lead-off presidential debates to his past clashes with the Fox News host. Trump conceded that, in looking back, he \u201cabsolutely\u201d has regrets, without going into detail. But he said if he hadn\u2019t conducted himself in this way, he wouldn\u2019t have come out on top. \u201cIf I were soft, if I were presidential \u2026 in a way it\u2019s a bad word, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with being presidential, but if I had not fought back in the way I fought back, I don\u2019t think I would have been successful,\u201d he told Kelly. Trump argued that he\u2019s a \u201ccounter-puncher\u201d who\u2019s only responding to the attacks against him. \u201cI respond pretty strongly, but in just about all cases, I\u2019ve been responding to what they did to me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-way street.\u201d The interview was conducted on the heels of an April meeting between Kelly and the Republican candidate at Trump Tower in New York City. Before that meeting, the two had been at odds for months \u2013 dating back to a Fox News-hosted debate last August, when Trump accused \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d host of asking him unfair questions. Today, Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, having vanquished 16 primary rivals and now turning his attention toward an expected general election battle against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state, while still trying to shake a primary challenge from Bernie Sanders, has sharpened her criticism of Trump as well in recent weeks, even saying Monday that he\u2019s a \u201cloose cannon\u201d who would be dangerous for the country. And she said he\u2019d return to \u201cfailed\u201d economic policies. Speaking with Kelly, Trump suggested the August debate actually helped prepare him for the battle ahead. \u201cIn a certain way, what you did might have been a favor, because I felt so good about having gotten through -- I said, \u2018If I could get through this debate, with those questions, you can get through anything,\u2019\u201d he said. Trump pointed to that debate when asked at what moment he realized he might actually win the race. \u201cI think that first debate meant something,\u201d Trump said, adding that he felt comfortable with the subject matter and the people he was competing against. At the same time, Trump tried to explain why he fired back at Kelly for confronting him about his past disparaging comments about women. \u201cI thought it was unfair,\u201d Trump said of the question, while noting it was the first question he\u2019d ever been asked at a debate. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying to myself, man, what a question.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t really blame you because you\u2019re doing your thing, but from my standpoint, I don\u2019t have to like it.\u201d As for his role in the presidential election in this year, Trump said: \u201cI really view myself now as somewhat of a messenger\u2026 This is a massive thing that\u2019s going on. These are millions and millions of people that have been disenfranchised from this country.\u201d Trump for the last several weeks has been working to reach out to members of the so-called Republican establishment in Washington he\u2019s spent much of his campaign railing against. He met last week with GOP congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 who has held back an endorsement for now. Trump and the lawmakers came away describing the meetings as positive. In the interview with Kelly, Trump briefly discussed his personal life, and how his older brother Fred died after a battle with alcoholism. \u201cI have never had a glass of alcohol,\u201d he said, calling his brother\u2019s death the \u201chardest thing for me to take.\u201d And while defending his tone on the campaign trail, Trump also said he takes \u201cvery seriously\u201d the responsibility of the office he\u2019s seeking. \u201cI understand what's going on. And when I see the fervor, when I see 25,000 people that have seats, and not one person during an hour speech will sit down. I say, sit down, everybody, sit down.\u00a0 And they don't sit down,\" he said. \"\u2026 I mean, that's a great compliment. But I do understand the power of the message. There's no question about it.\u201d",

            "article_content": " (Chevrolet) (Chevrolet) There\u2019s a heavy helping of \u201c\u2019bout time\u201d baked into the 2013 Chevrolet Corvette 427, but as far as birthday cakes go, it\u2019s plenty sweet. Built to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the legendary sports car, the 427 is the last iteration of the 6th generation of the \u2018Vette that will be introduced before an all-new model arrives next year. With a 505 hp V8 under the hood and a soft top overhead, the 427 is both the most powerful and fastest Corvette convertible ever made. It\u2019s powered by the same dry-sump 7.0-liter engine found in the Z06 coupe, more or less fulfilling a longtime wish of Corvette fans to have the biggest of the small blocks available in a drop-top body style. But while the 427 also gets the carbon fiber hood, front fenders and floor panel from the Z06, it passes on that car\u2019s lightweight aluminum frame, instead relying on the steel one from the standard Corvette Convertible, in part to help keep the price down. That was probably a good move, because it still costs $76,900 to start and cracks $90G once you add all of the optional anniversary badges and stripes, carbon fiber trim pieces and leather upholstered interior \u2013 and you know that you will. Why you want one: History like this doesn\u2019t come cheap, or very often. The 427 isn\u2019t technically a limited edition model, but Chevy will probably end up selling only about a thousand of them, so its collectability is almost guaranteed. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Chevy\u2019s 7.0-liter V8 is one of the greatest engines extant, and do you ever not want that in your car? Its noise alone will take years off of your mid-life crisis, especially with the absence of a hard top letting you enjoy it in full surround sound. Better than that, with only a six-speed manual transmission available, the 427 is literally geared toward the true driving enthusiast. Even at the end of its eight-year lifecycle, the Corvette platform remains a world-beater in the dynamics department and the power level on tap here is right on the money. The 427\u2019s fat rear tires can put all of it down in the turns and the car is as quick as anyone needs it to be in a straight line, no mater how long that line might be. Find one long enough and Chevy says you can hit 190 mph. Still, you\u2019ll never miss the aluminum frame because this is not the car you buy to set fast laps at the track. Canyon roads and highways are more its thing. GM\u2019s Magnetic Ride Control system is standard and lets you make the transition from level pavement to the bumps and bruises of inner city asphalt without wearing a kidney belt. Just don\u2019t scrape the front splitter on the way into the parking lot for cruise night, it\u2019s not a pretty sound. Why you might not want one: Did I mention the 7th generation Corvette is coming next year? As great a drive as the current Corvette is, it is from a long ago era. Even dressed in leather, the cabin wouldn\u2019t impress a Chevy Cruze owner and certainly not anyone that dropped this kind of money on whatever it is that they are driving. And while those trick shocks may dull the bumps, hit enough of them in succession and the 427's body will start rocking on that frame like a Crown Victoria during pothole season. The soft top isn\u2019t any more impressive. It looks like a pup tent when it\u2019s closed and doesn\u2019t keep out much more than the rain \u2013 but it does do that. One thing you need to know: The 427 is available as a DYI project, at least part of it is. You can go to the GM Performance Build Center in Wixom, Michigan, and hand-assemble your V8, which is then shipped to the Corvette factory in Bowling Green, Kentucky, for installation. You\u2019ll have to shell out $5,800 for the privilege, but that\u2019s what you get for not paying union dues. ---------- 2013 Chevrolet Corvette 427 Base Price: $76,900 As Tested: $91,320 Type: 2-seat, 2-door convertible Engine: 7.0L V8 Power: 505 hp, 470 lb-ft torque Transmission: 6-speed manua MPG: 15 city/24 hwy",

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Washington The most wounded man in Washington is James Comey. Ever since his legally incomprehensible announcement that he would not recommend criminal prosecution of Hillary Clinton, he has been the equivalent of an extra on the set of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d.\u00a0 His reputation tarnished.\u00a0 His legacy forever tainted. His own agents turned against him in disgust.\u00a0 Those, including lawyers, who had worked exhaustively gathering the incriminating evidence were furious that Comey had publicly laid out their case of how Clinton was grossly negligence under the Espionage Act, yet decided not to prosecute.\u00a0 Comey had gone from revered to reviled, all in one day. GREGG JARRETT: HILLARY, NIXON AND WATERGATE - THE PARALLELS ARE FRIGHTENING Now, his stunning announcement that he is reopening the criminal investigation of Clinton based on newly discovered evidence is, perhaps, the chance at redemption for which he may have been searching.\u00a0 He has disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner to thank for a second chance. According to confirmed reports, the FBI seized electronic devices in the possession of Weiner during the course of an investigation into his sexting with an underage girl for which he is now in legal jeopardy.\u00a0 Since Weiner is married to Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin, the FBI were legally entitled to access her emails on those same devices.\u00a0 Those are probably the messages that triggered a reopening of the Clinton probe. Whatever the source of the new evidence, it may have provided the excuse or pretext that Comey so desperately needed to remedy the wrong perceived by so many. \u00a0A legal \u201cdo over\u201d, if you will.\u00a0 A mistake corrected.\u00a0 An injustice rectified. Of course, it is altogether possible that Comey will reach the same conclusion as he did before \u2013that prosecutors could not prove Clinton broke the law.\u00a0 His statement stressed he does not know the \u201cimportance\u201d of the new emails. But if this is Comey\u2019s opportunity to atone, it is not good news for Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The Director may now be more determined than ever to reverse his legal judgment of Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified materials.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a first year law student getting to retake the final examination in criminal law after flunking the test.\u00a0 He can now change his legal analysis and arrive at a better conclusion. After all, it was Comey himself who testified before Congress that more than 2,000 classified documents were found on Clinton\u2019s personal server in her home \u2013clearly an unauthorized place under the law.\u00a0 He described her explanations as untruthful and her conduct \u201cextremely careless\u201d.\u00a0 That would be more than sufficient for criminal charges against anyone else whose name is not Clinton. What does all of this mean for Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the election a scant ten days from now?\u00a0 At this early stage, it is impossible to know. \u00a0Yes, at the moment, the electoral map favors Clinton substantially.\u00a0 But that could evaporate in a political instant. On its face, the revelation seems extremely damaging to her candidacy.\u00a0 Perhaps fatal.\u00a0 Yet, it is premature to say how voters will react on November 8th when they enter the voting booths across America.\u00a0 Some may view the resurrected FBI probe as patently unfair, coming a little more than a week before the election.\u00a0 Voters may feel she is being victimized and react with sympathy.\u00a0 The news may energize or motivate her supporters to cast their ballots in record numbers. For others, a reinvigorated FBI investigation will serve as proof they were right when they concluded, perhaps long ago, that Clinton is chronically corrupt.\u00a0 As pointed out in my recent column, a Clinton presidency would probably be engulfed in scandal and endless investigations, even in the absence of today\u2019s news.\u00a0 Do Americans want to cast a vote in favor of 4 years of acrimony and intransigence? And what happens if a President Clinton is indicted for crimes under the Espionage Act?\u00a0 Would she resign, as Nixon did\u2026 or temporarily step aside under the incapacity provision of the 25th Amendment\u00a0until her criminal\u00a0trial is concluded? \u00a0How would Congress react?\u00a0 The entire sordid affair could devolve into an impeachment trial reminiscent of her husband, Bill Clinton. Another national nightmare. These are weighty decisions which voters are now suddenly forced to consider.\u00a0 It may not be fair or right.\u00a0 But, in a democracy, freedom of choice inexorably falls to the citizenry. It brings both benefits and burdens.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In February 2009, the Senate intelligence committee gathered in a soundproof room to learn the stomach-churning details of the brutal interrogations the CIA conducted with its first important al-Qaida prisoners. Committee aides distributed a report based on a review of messages to CIA headquarters from two of the agency's secret overseas jails. Included was a 25-page chart with a minute-by-minute description of 17 days during which the first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, was kept awake, slammed into walls, shackled in stress positions, stuffed for hours into a small box and waterboarded to the point of unconsciousness. The captive ranted, pleaded and whimpered, an accompanying text said, but he never provided the information about brewing terrorist plots that the CIA thought he had. Senators were aghast. Some muttered that such horrific acts by Americans should never see the light of day, recalled aides who spoke on condition of anonymity because they could not publicly discuss a classified session. Other senators voiced outrage over how this new account differed from the antiseptic CIA descriptions of \"enhanced techniques.\" A few weeks later, the committee voted, 14-1, to begin a full investigation into the CIA's post-Sept. 11 detention and interrogation practices. The resulting report, a summary of which was released in December, was a rare instance of an oversight committee seeking to hold the CIA accountable in a public way. It also was the most detailed critique of the CIA in a generation. And it raised the question of how well other covert CIA programs are managed, from targeted killing with drones to the secret effort to train and arm Syrian rebels. Congressional intelligence committees long have been accused of being \"captured\" by the agencies they oversee. When they do expose and correct problems, it usually happens behind closed doors. Even for those who dispute some of the central conclusions, the 518-page summary of the 6,770-page classified study shows how a rigorous examination of a secret agency can expose misconduct, incompetence and bureaucratic spin. Based on a review of 6 million pages of CIA documents, the classified report covers 12 bound volumes. Senate investigators pored over records few outsiders ever see. Cables, chats, emails, internal memos and interview transcripts detailed not just the official story but the messy behind-the-scenes threads, including internal criticism and office gossip. The early bipartisanship quickly faded. Republicans withdrew from the investigation and at times actively opposed it. Written by Democrats working for California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, then the Senate intelligence committee's chairwoman, the report concluded that the brutal CIA interrogations failed in every case to produce unique, life-saving, otherwise unavailable intelligence, and that the CIA repeatedly distorted this fact. In dissent, Republicans and CIA officials say the report cherry-picks evidence, obscures context and suffers from the absence of interviews, which were not possible because of a pending criminal investigation. Still, the investigation forced the spy agency to publicly admit that it mismanaged the interrogation program, failed to punish misconduct and detained people it shouldn't have. Yet the intelligence committees have never taken a similar look at what is now the premier counterterrorism effort, the CIA's drone-killing program, according to congressional officials who were not authorized to be quoted discussing the matter. Intelligence committee staff members are allowed to watch videos of CIA drone missile strikes to monitor the agency's claims that civilian casualties are limited. But the aides do not typically get access to the operational cables, message traffic, interview transcripts and other raw material that forms the basis of a decision to kill a suspected terrorist. Nor have they been able to examine cables, emails and raw reporting to investigate recent perceived intelligence lapses, such as whether the CIA failed to predict the swift fall of Arab governments, Russia's move into Ukraine or the rapid military advance of the Islamic State group. And there have been no public oversight reports on the weak performance of the CIA's multibillion-dollar \"nonofficial cover\" program to set up case officers posing as businessmen, which has met with criticism. The six-year Senate investigation \"illustrates both the strengths and the weaknesses of the oversight process,\" said Steven Aftergood, an intelligence expert with the Federation of American Scientists. \"It represented a massive allocation of effort, tens of millions of dollars, years of research, millions of documents, all to generate a narrative account that will dominate public understanding of CIA interrogation for decades to come.\" But no one has been held accountable for the conduct described in the report, there is nothing in the law that would prevent the CIA from repeating it and there is no prospect of a similar investigation into other covert intelligence programs. Since the underlying CIA records remain secret, there always may be disagreement about whether detainees who were brutalized subsequently provided information important to the hunt for Osama bin Laden, for example_even if it's clear that CIA got much of its intelligence in that case from other sources. An anti-torture advocate, Georgetown law professor David Cole, wrote recently that he wasn't convinced by the report's argument that harsh measures were ineffective in every instance. The latest opinion polls find widespread support for the CIA's actions and for the notion that the government may occasionally need to torture terrorists. But if the report did not immediately change public sentiments or settle the question of whether CIA torture worked, it clearly documented dozens of instances of the CIA exaggerating and misstating the fruits of these interrogations to justify its actions, including inaccurate testimony to Congress about the bin Laden case. CIA officials reject some of those criticisms but embrace others. \"In some instances, we simply failed to live up to the standards that we set for ourselves and that the American people expect of us,\" CIA Director John Brennan told reporters at CIA headquarters in December. It is difficult to imagine him uttering those words in the absence of the Senate report. ___ A HISTORIC UNDERTAKING The report's principal author, Dan Jones, spent years of long nights and weekends sifting through millions of classified electronic pages in a secure government facility in Tysons Corner, Virginia. Others heavily involved included Mike Davidson, the committee's former general counsel; David Grannis, the current staff director; aides Evan Gottesman and Chad Tanner; and Alissa Starzak, a former CIA lawyer now at the Pentagon. Jones came to know the CIA's interrogation program better than any of the CIA officers who worked on it, colleagues say, because he could see the full picture over a period of years, including exactly what every detainee told his questioners, under what circumstances and how the information was used. Buried in the millions of pages were details that even CIA directors didn't fully grasp, as evidenced by then-Director Michael Hayden's error-filled 2007 briefing on the program to the Senate intelligence committee that is painstakingly chronicled in the report's appendix. (Hayden maintains he was discussing the program as it had evolved in 2006, not the one that existed in 2002.) The Senate's Church and the House's Pike committees of the 1970s applied similarly aggressive scrutiny to the CIA, said Loch Johnson, who worked on those investigations and wrote a book about the Senate probe. But those investigators, who documented widespread intelligence agency misdeeds in a seminal effort that paved the way for the modern system of congressional oversight, couldn't dig as deeply. They were looking at hundreds of secret programs instead of one, and they were operating in an era before instant messages and digital search tools. The Senate intelligence committee got the extraordinary access to internal CIA documents mainly because of the fateful decision by CIA operations chief Jose Rodriguez in 2005 to order the shredding of videotapes of some of the interrogations. When that destruction was revealed in 2007, Hayden, seeking to rebut charges of a cover-up, agreed to turn over the operational cables describing the interrogations. From there, it was difficult for the CIA to resist further demands for more records. In the end, the committee got nearly everything it asked for, with the exception of 9,000 pages blocked by the White House on the grounds of executive privilege. ___ OVERSIGHT CONTRADICTION Michael Colaresi, a political scientist who has written about how Western democracies police their spy agencies, believes access to internal agency records should be a regular feature of congressional intelligence oversight. The U.S. once led the way in keeping tabs on its spies, but now several Western nations conduct more thorough oversight of their intelligence agencies, he said. A Netherlands parliamentary commission, for example, employs outside experts who can demand documents, require witness testimony and issue public reports. \"Intelligence oversight is necessary to reassure the public that if there is bad policy being done behind the veil of classification, it's going to be revealed,\" he said. But U.S. congressional intelligence oversight committees have neither the staff nor the time to regularly conduct in-depth investigations. More commonly, oversight consists of weekly secret hearings at which lawmakers or aides listen to top CIA officials talk. Also, committee members tend to be big supporters of intelligence agencies. When Edward Snowden revealed secret National Security Agency surveillance programs that disturbed many Americans, most intelligence committee members defended the programs. The lawmakers had been briefed on them in secret for years by NSA officials who believed they were crucial tools. Feinstein embodies that contradiction. She backed the NSA after Snowden, and she long has been known as a staunch defender of the CIA. The torture investigation, she said in an interview with The Associated Press, has \"changed how I view management in the CIA. It's changed how I view the brotherhood of the CIA. I believe you do not lie to your oversight committee. And I think the way the program was managed was sloppy.\" The lesson for traditional intelligence oversight, she said, was that \"you can sit and listen to a report \u2014 you don't know whether it's all the truth, you don't know what gets left out. And part of (CIA) tradecraft is deception.\" She said she believes the CIA continues to lie about the effectiveness of torture. \"Absolutely,\" she said. \"The question is, what can you do about it?\" The CIA declined to comment on her remarks. Asked about CIA drones, however, she pivoted to a defense of the agency. Although her report includes examples of the CIA kidnapping the wrong person and brutalizing another detainee who was \"not the man we thought he was,\" Feinstein expressed confidence the CIA has not made such mistakes with drones. In killing with drones, \"the CIA takes its time,\" she said. \"They're very careful about the identification of the individual. And they're able to make that identification. Sometimes the intelligence gathering goes on for months.\" Feinstein points out that congressional oversight of drones has been far more thorough than was the early oversight of interrogations. The George W. Bush administration gave a small number of cursory briefings about the CIA interrogation program beginning in 2002 to a few congressional leaders, while the Obama administration regularly has updated the intelligence committees about drone killings. But drone opponents question whether Congress has been co-opted by a superficial semblance of oversight and is failing to push for answers to hard questions about drones, such as whether hatred engendered by the strikes outweighs their tactical benefits. The findings on interrogations \"do make you wonder what else we might not be conducting adequate oversight on,\" said Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. That appears to be an academic question, because the Republicans who now control the Senate have expressed misgivings about public intelligence oversight. Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the new committee chairman, has asked executive branch agencies to give back copies of the torture report's classified version, in what is widely seen as a move to prevent its future release. For the first time in many years, the Senate and House intelligence committees closed the normally public hearing in February featuring the CIA director discussing the threats facing the country. Burr's spokeswoman, Rebecca Glover Watkins, pointed out that the committee recently held an open oversight hearing during which the chief of the National Counter Terrorism Center faced tough questions on a number of matters. The chairman plans to hold more open hearings than Democrats did in years past, she said. ___ DISTORTIONS EXPOSED CIA officials have argued that after a rough start, there was plenty of internal oversight of the interrogation program, including by the agency's inspector general, who wrote a critical report in 2004. But the Senate investigation exposed misstatements by CIA officials as part of that inquiry that stood, uncorrected, for years. One example involves the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, the only person to be seized from the U.S. justice system, declared an enemy combatant and thrown in a military jail. In 2003, when the inspector general was gathering information about the interrogation program, a CIA lawyer asked analysts to supply \"a list of specific plots that have been thwarted\" through the fruits of brutal interrogations, according to the Senate report. In response, a senior CIA analyst sent an email rife with false information, the report says. Among the errors, she said that Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, after being waterboarded and otherwise brutalized, identified a photograph as an al-Qaida operative named Saleh al-Marri, who was then arrested. But, as the CIA finally acknowledged in its 2013 response to the Senate report, al-Marri had been in federal custody for 16 months before Mohammed was captured. He had been indicted in Illinois on credit card fraud and other charges, including lying to the FBI about his al-Qaida ties. It was one of many such errors made by that same officer, who remains in a senior position at the agency. But the CIA argues that Mohammed's information was nonetheless crucial to the government's understanding of al-Marri, implying that the al-Marri case stands as a justification for brutal interrogations. After Mohammed told interrogators al-Marri was sent to the U.S. to conduct a terrorist attack, the Bush administration had him placed in military detention under harsh conditions. He later pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in federal court. After serving the remainder of a 15-year sentence, he was released in January and deported to his native Qatar. One of al-Marri's lawyers, Jonathan Hafetz, says it's ridiculous to suggest that torturing Mohammed stopped al-Marri. When the FBI arrested him they seized a laptop containing searches about cyanide, material about bin Laden, coded messages to Mohammed and communications with an al-Qaida figure known to have handled the Sept. 11 financing. \"The FBI was on to him,\" Hafetz said. \"Had he been convicted on the original fraud and false statement charges, he faced a heavy sentence, potentially decades long.\" ___ LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO STOP IT Colaresi and other scholars argue that the full version of the report and some of the underlying documents should be released, so the public can sort through the competing claims by the CIA, Republicans and Democrats about what the records actually show. But while Obama publicly supported releasing the report's findings and conclusions, the administration privately pushed to keep significant parts of the summary secret, Feinstein said. \"The president said that he agreed the report should be made public, that he doesn't condone (the harsh interrogations), but it sort of ends there,\" Feinstein said. She said she perceived \"an incredible closeness\" between Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, and Brennan, \"and the president and John Brennan.\" In negotiations with Feinstein about what parts of the summary should be censored, McDonough spoke for the White House, but there was no daylight between him and the CIA, she said. Feinstein said both wanted to black out large chunks of the executive summary in the name of protecting sensitive information. In the end, she prevailed on many points after her staff demonstrated that much of what the CIA wanted to withhold was already public in memoirs and government reports. But she had to accede to the CIA's demand to leave out pseudonyms that would have allowed readers to trace the role of individual CIA officers without knowing their true names. White House spokesman Ned Price said all the redactions were justified for national security reasons. The already fraught relationship between the committee and the administration was complicated by the flap over allegations that the CIA late last year improperly snooped on investigators' computers, and by the CIA's countercharges that the investigators wrongly took documents to which they were not entitled. The documents were part of a CIA review that Feinstein says supports the committee's assertions that torture didn't work. The review remains classified and is the subject of a public records lawsuit. Even after an agreement on redactions was reached, Feinstein said, the executive branch made a last-ditch effort to stop the report from becoming public. And it almost worked. On Friday, Dec. 5, just days before Feinstein was to release the summary, she said, Secretary of State John Kerry called her to warn that embassies were likely to be attacked and Americans likely to die if the details of brutal CIA interrogations were made public. A classified intelligence assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the same thing, though Senate aides say it was based on an incorrect summary of what was in the Senate report. \"He was very concerned that it might spark an attack here or there. And I actually didn't think it would,\" Feinstein said. \"But how could I be sure?\" Feinstein delayed the release as she considered Kerry's request that she turn the report over to the president, who could decide when the time was right to make it public. But then James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, briefed senators in a conference call on the secret damage assessment. Most Democrats were not convinced. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, who had been defeated for re-election, told a local newspaper about the possibility he would make the report public on his own, by entering it into the Senate record. No attack or act of violence has been publicly attributed to the Senate report. \"You can either cover it up,\" Feinstein said, \"or you try to say that history must prevent this.\"",

Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he\u2019ll meet Tuesday with presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton to talk about how she\u2019d run the country if elected in November but indicated he has no plans to quit the race before the party\u2019s July convention. \u201cWhat we will talk about exactly is what kind of platform we have and\u2026 what kind of administration she will have,\u201d the Vermont senator told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Sanders is facing increasing pressure to end his campaign to create party unity in the general election race against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, especially since Clinton last week got enough delegates to clinch the nomination. However, Clinton needed the help of superdelegates -- those who have pledged their convention vote to Clinton and whom Sanders hopes to win over in the coming weeks. At a press conference late Sunday outside Sanders\u2019 Burlington, Vermont, home, the candidate made clear his campaign is still alive. \u201cWe're taking our campaign to the convention. We're good at arithmetic,\u201d said Sanders, despite trailing Clinton by more than 500 superdelegates. Sander also said he looks forward to talking to Clinton but that he needs to know whether she\u2019ll embrace two key parts of his campaign platform -- standing up \u201cforcefully\u201d for working families and taking on Wall Street and other \u201cbig money influences.\u201d More specifically, Sanders told ABC that he wants Clinton to commit to a progressive tax system that makes big banks and billion-dollar-a-year corporations \u201cpay their fair share of taxes\u201d to help America\u2019s under-class with health care costs and other needs. Sanders also said he wants Clinton to push for free tuition at public colleges and universities, on which both agree, despite different plans. The self-described democratic socialist also seemed to discredit arguments that staying in the race, which includes the final Democratic primary Tuesday in the District of Columbia, will hurt Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the general election. \u201cWhat my head is on right now is do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump, to do everything I can to make sure that the Democratic Party transforms itself into becoming a grassroots party that represents working people and young people, and not just a party that goes out raising money from the wealthy,\u201d Sanders said.",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on the 2016 presidential race (all times EDT): 11:15 a.m. Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, were back at their longtime church in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday, a day after the Virginia senator made his campaign debut with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as her running mate. Kaine \u2014 a former choir member at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church \u2014 sang a solo during Communion. His wife spoke briefly at the end of the service, telling parishioners how important they've been in their lives. She said \"you have helped shape us\" and that she and her husband \"will really need your prayers.\" And then, with the November election in mind, she said: \"We will all have a big party at the other end, no matter what happens.\" St. Elizabeth's is a majority black church in Richmond's Highland Park area. ___ 10:15 a.m. Bernie Sanders says he wishes Hillary Clinton had picked someone like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her running mate instead of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Sanders tells NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" that Kaine is a \"very, very smart guy\" and a \"very nice guy\" but wouldn't have been his vice presidential choice. Sanders \u2014 who describes himself as a democratic socialist \u2014 says Kaine is more conservative than he is. Warren is known for her fiery edges, particularly when going after Wall Street and big banks, and is a favorite of the party's liberal base. ___ 9:35 a.m. Bernie Sanders wants the head of the Democratic National Committee to step down \u2014 after leaked emails suggested the party played favorites during the presidential primary. Here's what Sanders tells ABC's \"This Week\": \"I'm not shocked, but I am disappointed.\" Emails posted to the website Wikileaks show that at least some DNC officials were looking at ways to undercut Sanders' campaign, including questioning his religious beliefs. Sanders says the party chairwoman, Rep., Debbie Wasserman Schultz, should resign immediately. The Vermont senator says a new leader is needed to focus the DNC on defeating Donald Trump, attracting young voters and improving the economy. ___ 9:30 a.m. Hillary Clinton's campaign manager accuses Russia of leaking emails on purpose from the Democratic National Committee to help Republican Donald Trump in the presidential election. Wikileaks has posted emails that including several denunciations of Clinton's primary rival, Bernie Sanders, and his supporters. Robby Mook says on CNN's 'State of the Union\" that experts are telling the campaign \"Russian state actors\" broke into the DNC's emails, and that other experts say these Russians are now selectively releasing the emails. He says it's no coincidence the emails are coming out on the eve of the party's nominating convention in Philadelphia. ___ 9 a.m. President Barack Obama says Donald Trump's suggestion that the U.S. might not come to the defense of NATO allies is another sign of what he calls Trump's \"lack of preparedness\" on foreign policy. Obama tells CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Trump's comments amount to an admission that the U.S. \"might not abide\" by NATO's \"most central tenet.\" NATO members promise that an attack against any of them is considered an assault against all. ___ 8:50 a.m. It's become a bit easier for Hillary Clinton to formally claim the nomination at the upcoming Democratic National Convention. The Democratic National Committee has released a slightly trimmed list of superdelegates \u2014 those are the party officials who can back any candidate. There are now 4,763 total delegates, and 712 of them are superdelegates. Two superdelegates left their positions in the last month, while Rep. Mark Takai of Hawaii died from cancer. It now takes 2,382 delegates to formally clinch the nomination. Heading into the convention, Clinton now has 2,814, when including superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. Sanders has 1,893. More than 50 remain uncommitted.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee states President Obama was born in the United States Donald Trump tried to tamp down a newly revived campaign dust-up Friday over his views on President Obama\u2019s birthplace, declaring the president was born in the United States \u2013 \u201cperiod\u201d \u2013 after declining to make that statement earlier this week. The Republican presidential nominee also tried to blame Hillary Clinton for starting the controversy back in 2008, which her team denies. He cast his remarks as a bid to put the issue to rest once and for all, at a time when his poll numbers are rising. \u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,\u201d Trump said in Washington, D.C. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.\u201d He spoke at his new Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a visit that began with lengthy remarks from military supporters and veterans. He briefly addressed the \u201cbirther\u201d issue at the end. The statement comes after Trump\u2019s response on the matter in an interview Wednesday revived the issue. In the interview with\u00a0The Washington Post, Trump was asked whether he believed Obama was born in the U.S. \"I'll answer that question at the right time,\" Trump told the paper. \"I just don't want to answer it yet.\" Trump\u2019s campaign spokesman, trying to calm the waters, said overnight the Republican candidate now believes Obama was born in the U.S. Campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Trump \"did a great service to the country\" by bringing closure to the debate. \"In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,\" Miller said. But the Clinton campaign seized on Trump\u2019s reluctance to address the issue in his Post interview. Speaking shortly before Trump across town at the Black Women's Agenda Symposium, Clinton said Friday the Republican nominee was \u201cfeeding into\u201d the \u201cbigotry and bias that lurks in our country\u201d \u2013 and should apologize. \u201cBarack Obama was born in America,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.\u201d Her campaign called his Friday comments \"disgraceful.\" The dust-up comes as Trump gains on Clinton in national and battleground state polls, even surpassing her in some states. A new Fox News poll shows Clinton topping Trump by just one point among likely voters in the four-way ballot nationally. In the head-to-head matchup, Trump\u2019s up by one point. Both candidates were fundraising Friday after events in Washington. Clinton has endured a rough week on the campaign trail, after criticizing some Trump supporters last Friday as \"deplorables\" and then having to take time off from the campaign due to a bout of pnemonia. She used the birther issue to try and go back on offense. While Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump several years ago was a key figure in stoking the so-called \"birther\" controversy. Critics saw it as an attempt to delegitimize the nation\u2019s first black president. Trump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the \"birther\" issue. The Trump campaign\u2019s statement late Thursday claimed that Clinton launched the \u201cbirther\u201d movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008. \"Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,\" the statement said. \"This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer.\" Clinton has long denied the claim, and fact-checkers previously have found no public evidence that she or her campaign directly pushed the issue. Rather, Trump\u2019s comments appear to refer to reports that Clinton supporters circulated an email during the bitter 2008 primary race questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship. Yet former McClatchy D.C. bureau chief James Asher said on Twitter Friday that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in fact \u201ctold me in person\u201d that Obama was born in Kenya. Obama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election. Anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed, long-form document must submit a waiver request, and have that request approved by Hawaii's health department. In 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump about his birthplace, Obama submitted a waiver request. He dispatched his personal lawyer to Hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to Washington on a plane. The form said Obama was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. It is signed by the delivery doctor, Obama's mother and the local registrar. At the White House on Friday, Obama declined to comment at length on the issue, saying he\u2019s got other business to attend to \u2013 and is confident about where he was born. Fox News\u2019 Nicholas Kalman and Tamara Gitt and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

What seems more likely here is that having suffered in 2012 for indulging their desires for conservative purity, Republican primary voters are making a calculated choice to emphasize electability. President Obama, not the GOP greybeards, taught them that lesson. Republican insiders could take a lesson from him too: always, always be taking care of your base. While functional parties require order to be kept, a victory should always be followed by magnanimity. So GOP flacks considering whether to tweet that tweet or offer that triumphal quote to a reporter may want to chillax, man. If they want to expand the map and increase their chances to control the Senate, Republican leaders will need activists to work hard for long-shot candidates in places like Minnesota and Virginia.

The 15-second ad, posted to YouTube on Tuesday, which says it is paid for by the Freedom Pioneers Action Network, takes footage from an ad run by Sasse, in which his two daughters talk about how conservative their father is and how much he dislikes Obamacare. \u2018Fact: Ben Sasse said Obamacare \u2018is an important first step,\u2019 \u2019 says a female narrator, pointing to a quote that has been repeatedly leveled against Sasse, which he says was taken entirely out of context. \u2018Then he dodged responsibility,\u2019 the narrator says, as a clip of Sasse\u2019s daughters talking in the candidate\u2019s ad runs. \u2018Tell Ben Sasse, Nebraskans protect their families, they don\u2019t hide behind them,\u2019 the narrator says\u2026.According to FEC filings, the Super PAC previously spent more than $100,000 attacking Sasse.

But even a few high-risk patients could add millions of dollars in costs to those plans. The costs could be passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums and to taxpayers in the form of higher subsidy expense\u2026.

Under Obama, the United States has suffered some real reputational damage. I say that as someone who sympathizes with many of Obama\u2019s foreign policy goals.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the State Department to speed up the release of documents related to a decision made under former Secretary Hillary Clinton to allow a foreign defense contractor that admitted criminal wrongdoing to continue doing business with the Pentagon. The Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request in 2013 for emails and internal memos involving a U.S. subsidiary of the British aerospace giant BAE Systems. AP sued after the State Department failed to provide those and other requested public records, including Clinton's official calendars and emails transmitted through her private server. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon told the government at a court hearing in Washington that the documents must be provided to AP well before the November election. Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \"Tell your colleagues at the State Department ... weekend trips to Nantucket should be off the table,\" Leon told one of the government lawyers. \"They should be rolling up their sleeves to get this done.\" BAE pleaded guilty in March 2010 to one criminal count of conspiring to making false statements about its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paid a $400 million fine. The Justice Department said that BAE had conducted a 20-year practice of illegal payments to Saudi Arabian officials related to arms deals. The conviction could have resulted in the American subsidiary losing billions in U.S. military contracts. But an assistant secretary working for Clinton signed off on BAE keeping its lucrative U.S. business. Documents show Clinton was briefed on the issue before the decision was made. In a court hearing last week, AP lawyer Jay Brown told Leon the documents likely contain information of public interest, including the reasoning behind allowing BAE to keep its U.S. weapons contracts. \"Many of those elements relate directly to decisions that American voters are going to have to make in this election,\" Brown said. \"At least they potentially relate to that. We don't have the documents.\" The department estimates it will have to sort through at least 10,000 pages. Only a small fraction of them have been provided to AP so far, most heavily censored. In previous affidavits to the judge, State Department lawyers said they expected to show some internal documents to attorneys for BAE to allow the firm to ask for redactions of any proprietary trade secrets. A lawyer for the State Department said last week that BAE's attorneys were reviewing the materials \"pretty quickly.\" The government lawyer added, however, that in some cases the agency and BAE's law firms have differed sentence by sentence over how much material should be blacked out before release to the AP. Among the items redacted as \"trade secrets\" so far include the entirety of a published news article about the BAE case. In another instance, the number of potential criminal violations the Justice Department figured the military contractor had committed was also obscured as a \"trade secret.\" Justice Department lawyer Carol Federighi, representing the State Department, told Leon Wednesday she had personally reviewed all the redactions and stood by them. \"He's already got a lot more than we normally release,\" she said, gesturing toward the AP's lawyer. Leon, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2002, warned Federighi he would hold the government accountable for any unnecessary redactions, even if it meant hauling U.S. officials into court and holding a closed-door hearing on the purportedly secret information. \"As many claims as you are asserting, you are probably going to be in this courtroom every day for a month,\" the judge told the government lawyer. \"It'll be painful for all involved -- including me.\"",

            "article_content": "PayPal founder addresses the Republican National Convention CLEVELAND \u2013 Pro-gay Republicans have held Donald Trump up as the most supportive nominee in GOP history, but at this week's Republican National Convention, their excitement is clashing with the stark realization that their party is still pushing a very different message. While Republicans seek to broaden their appeal ahead of November's election, the party adopted a platform that moves farther away from gay rights with a new admonition of gay parenting, adding language that says kids raised by a mother and father tend to be \"physically and emotionally healthier.\" Even as Trump declares himself a \"friend of the gay community,\" the GOP platform maintains its opposition to gay marriage and to bathroom choice for transgender people. Yet in a first for a GOP convention, an openly gay speaker acknowledged his sexuality Thursday from the podium -- and put fellow Republicans on the spot by saying he disagreed with parts of the platform. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, said only Trump was being honest about how \"fake culture wars\" distract from America's economic decline. \"I am proud to be gay,\" Thiel declared. \"I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American.\" He was greeted with wild cheers and extended applause as some delegations jumped to their feet, in a striking moment for a Republican gathering. The closing-night moment aside, Trump's nominating convention featured awkward silences on the rare occasions when gay rights have come up. Connecticut State Rep. Cara Pavalock said that's a reflection of how much work the party needs to do on the issue. \"I joined the party not for what it is but for what I know it will be in the future,\" said Pavalock, a Trump supporter. For those hoping Trump's nomination will help repair the perception that Republicans are hostile to equality, there's another challenge: Mainstream gay rights groups are denouncing the New York billionaire, arguing that tolerance for one minority group doesn't excuse prejudice toward others -- like Hispanics and Muslims. Trump, who has said he'd nominate Supreme Court justices who might overturn gay marriage, has nonetheless spoken effusively about his friendships with gay people while avoiding anti-gay rhetoric that many other GOP candidates have embraced. After a gunman claiming Islamic State allegiance killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Trump said he'd be better than Hillary Clinton because he wouldn't allow in Muslim immigrants who want to \"murder gays.\" At the same time, Trump has rattled many voters with unflattering comments about women, while insisting Mexico sends rapists and criminals into the U.S. \"His hatred toward anybody is a huge concern,\" said Jay Brown of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights group. \"When he attacks women, he attacks us. When he attacks Muslims, he's attacking us.\" Gay Republicans who attended one event in a downtown ballroom Tuesday -- titled \"Wake Up! (the most fab party at the RNC)\" -- said it promoted the message that Islam and LGBT tolerance are incompatible. Outside the party, police kept at bay protesters with signs reading \"Queers Against Racism.\" Though gay rights groups have pointed to Trump's rhetoric about other minorities as evidence of intolerance, Republicans say that's an attempt to blur the issues to help Democrats win elections and raise money. \"They are hell-bent on keeping this a political issue,\" said Republican strategist Richard Grenell. Four years ago Grenell, who is gay, was hired by 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney to be his foreign policy spokesman, but resigned under pressure from social conservatives who questioned Romney's conservatism. This week, he attended a \"Big Tent Brunch\" on the convention's sidelines, hosted by the American Unity Fund, a GOP group that promotes LGBT rights. At the brunch -- held in a literal big tent at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, pro-LGBT Republicans sipped mimosas and mingled with transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner while a man carried a rainbow version of the Gadsden flag -- a tea party symbol. Added was the phrase \"Shoot Back,\" employed by gun rights advocates after the Orlando shooting to suggest the victims should have been armed. And at the Quicken Loans Arena where Trump was nominated, there were mostly vague allusions if any to gay rights from convention speakers -- such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who praised police for protecting, among others, people of \"every sexual orientation.\"",

(AP) Authorities in Louisiana were forced to use pepper spray on a crowd of nearly 70 protesters during a U.S. Senate debate at one of the state\u2019s historically black universities Wednesday night, which featured white supremacist David Duke. Dillard University police used pepper spray twice to try and disperse the protesters who were ttrying to get into the building as the debate started. Police also forcibly separated a group that linked arms at a gate to the campus so a police unit believed to be carrying Duke could exit. At least one person was detained during the debate and police were seen escorting several away from one of the campus gates but it was unclear if anyone was charged. There were six candidates on stage, but the focal point of the debate was the former Ku Klux Klan leader even though he lagged in the polls and hasn\u2019t made a big enough splash in politics this time around. Democratic lawyer Caroline Fayard called Duke a \"snake.\" Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy called Duke a liar. Democratic Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell said Fayard has been lying about him as she tried to connect him to Duke. Campbell said he has nothing in common with Duke except both men were \"breathing.\" Republican U.S. Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming largely tried to ignore Duke as they sought to distinguish themselves from the major competitors, but the debate turned time and again to Duke, who narrowly reached the 5 percent polling benchmark set by Raycom Media for participation in the debate broadcast across most of Louisiana. Duke suggested Kennedy, the race's front-runner, tried to raise taxes on homeowners and that all five of his competitors on the stage were \"beholden to big money.\" In response, Kennedy cited Duke's prison number. Duke spent a year in federal prison after pleading guilty in 2002 to bilking his supporters and cheating on his taxes. Duke claimed he was \"targeted by the government.\" When moderator John Snell of WVUE-TV interrupted Duke to explain he pleaded guilty to the crime, Duke yelled: \"You're a typical media hack!\" Two dozen people are vying Republican David Vitter's seat. He isn't seeking re-election. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Memos obtained by the House Oversight Committee are not official enrollment numbers, but say that as of the morning of Oct. 2, \u201csix enrollments [had] occurred so far.\u201d After two days, only 248 enrollments were on the books out of an estimated population of uninsured Americans in the tens of millions. More from Fox News. [Watch Fox: Health Oversight and Government Reform Committee Head, Rep. Darell Issa, R-Calif., discusses new ObamaCare subpoenas in the 11 a.m. ET hour] Dire digits - President Obama and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have refused to share enrollment numbers, but this snapshot shows the extent of the failure as ObamaCare opened for business. That\u2019s significant as bipartisan demands for delaying penalties for the uninsured continue to grow. Team Obama is trying to hold the line, but with a steady stream of stories showing the plight of families losing coverage because of ObamaCare regulations, the failure to launch becomes increasingly dire. The scope of the debacle also ups the chances that Sebelius will have to be cashiered as part of a re-launch in the months to come.

This is more of a show-me moment,\u201d \u2013 Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., describing the ObamaCare briefing to reporters. Welfare dominates - ObamaCare\u2019s architects envisioned a nearly even split between enrollees in private-sector policies and the government program for low-income Americans, Medicaid. But as WaPo points out, the first month of the program shows a massive skew toward the welfare program. Maryland, for example, has seen 96 percent of its ObamaCare enrollments going into Medicaid. Federal tax dollars pay for the first three years of the expanded Medicaid offerings under the law, but then, taxpayers in those states that opted to join the program are on the hook.

Congressional investigators caught an improper February 2009 back-channel request for information in a document dragnet of IRS emails, but the agency managed to avoid revealing Lerner\u2019s response.

            "article_content": "Raw video: Republican lawmaker serves subpoena at House hearing demanding full investigation file on Hillary Clinton email probe from FBI A powerful Republican lawmaker abruptly stopped a hearing Monday on Capitol Hill to serve a subpoena demanding the FBI\u2019s full investigative file on the Hillary Clinton email probe to a top official, telling the man \u201cyou are hereby served.\u201d The dramatic moment came as House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, expressed frustration that the FBI would not guarantee to provide the committee with the full, unedited, unredacted investigative summaries of the federal inquiry into Clinton\u2019s homebrewed server and the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s potential mishandling of classified information. \u201cThat\u2019s the way a banana republic acts, not the way the United States of America acts,\u201d Chaffetz told FBI acting legislative affairs chief Jason Herring. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to have to issue a subpoena to see unclassified information.\u201d The FBI could fight the subpoena, though analysts say a resolution could come quickly. \u201cThere are judges sitting in an emergent capacity for applications like this,\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s resolved by the end of this week.\u201d Chaffetz and other Republicans on the panel say the FBI has withheld summaries of interviews with witnesses and unnecessarily blacked out material from documents sent last month. \u201cWe decide what's relevant -- not the Department of Justice, not the FBI,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cWe are entitled to the full file.\u201d Democrats on the panel dismissed Chaffetz\u2019s theatrics at the emergency hearing and insisted the sole purpose of the hearing was to undermine Clinton's presidential bid. \u201cAs far as I can tell, the only \u2018emergency\u2019 is that the election is less than two months away,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said. Witnesses at the hearing on several occasions said they could not answer the questions from lawmakers in an open forum and the committee later voted to hold the remainder of the hearing in closed session. FBI Director James Comey last week defended the decision to forgo criminal charges against Clinton after a lengthy probe into whether then-Secretary of State Clinton mishandled classified information that flowed through the private email system located in her New York home. Comey told bureau employees in an internal memo that it wasn't a close call. Republicans have assailed Comey's ruling and demanded that the Justice Department open a new investigation into whether Clinton lied during testimony last year before the House panel investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi. The FBI provided portions of the Clinton probe file to Congress last month and warned lawmakers that the documents \"contain classified and other sensitive material\" and are not to be made public. But Republicans have said the documents \"did not constitute a complete investigative file,\" as many of the records had been substantially blacked out or were missing altogether. \u201cSo here\u2019s what we have heard from people who have seen this stuff: that the FBI is attempting to create a false impression of what they want us to think they found by selectively releasing all information,\u201d Napolitano said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cIf all of it had been released, people could form their own opinions about the wisdom and lawfulness of the FBI\u2019s decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Barry Bennett on the dismissal of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s abrupt firing Monday came down to a battle of ultimatums. And ultimately, Lewandowski lost. Paul Manafort, the veteran operative who since March has been amassing influence inside Trump HQ, recently telegraphed through third parties he would be gone in 48 hours if Trump didn\u2019t oust Lewandowski, who'd run his campaign from the outset. Manafort was fed up with battling Lewandowski and let the campaign know the two of them \"just couldn't get along.\" From there, it became a family affair. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner didn\u2019t want to lose Manafort, believing him to be the more experienced hand to guide the campaign into the general election. They convinced Trump to keep him \u2013 and the only way to do that, given Manafort\u2019s terms, was to dump Lewandowski. Faced with a choice, Trump chose Manafort. This account was relayed to Fox News by a campaign source. The details shed light on arguably the biggest staff shake-up of the 2016 cycle. Despite the shock of Trump parting ways with Lewandowski, one of his closest and most loyal advisers, just weeks before the convention, in some corners the decision was not so surprising. The former conservative activist played a central role in daily operations, fundraising, and Trump's search for a running mate, but Lewandowski's aggressive approach also fueled near-constant campaign infighting that complicated Trump's shift toward the general election. Another Trump campaign official, Michael Caputo, resigned Monday afternoon over a tweet he sent out earlier in the day about Lewandowski's firing, a campaign source told Fox News. Ding dong the witch is dead! https://t.co/pSqQwmAGz1 pic.twitter.com/5dE7GMeEK6 Caputo tweeted \"Ding, dong, the witch is dead\" shortly after news about Lewandowski broke.\u00a0\u00a0Accompanying the tweet was a photo from the \"Wizard of Oz,\" showing the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East protruding from under a house. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed Caputo is no longer with the campaign. Reached on Monday by The Associated Press, Lewandowski deflected any criticism of his approach, pointing instead to Manafort. \"Paul Manafort has been in operational control of the campaign since April 7. That's a fact,\" Lewandowski said, declining to elaborate on his dismissal. In a subsequent interview with CNN, Lewandowski repeatedly said he didn\u2019t know why he was fired. But he said working for the campaign was \u201can honor and a privilege\u201d and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t change one second.\u201d He also claimed there was no animosity in the relationship with Manafort. A person close to Trump told the AP that Lewandowski was forced out largely because of his poor relationship with the Republican National Committee and GOP officials. On Capitol Hill, a Republican congressional aide close to pro-Trump lawmakers told Fox News the campaign did not inform members of Congress of the Lewandowski departure. Still, some sources said they were not surprised by the move and had been given the impression there would be a pivot soon to the general election, involving a potential staffing change. Fox News is told that Trump\u2019s children ultimately convinced the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to lose Lewandowski \u2013 an effort preceded by the tensions between Manafort and Lewandowski. Manafort was originally brought on in March to help the Trump campaign\u2019s delegate operation. He was later promoted to the role of campaign chairman \u2013 and will now take over as campaign manager, Fox News is told. \u201cHe\u2019s the campaign chairman, so yeah \u2013 he\u2019s the person in charge,\u201d Trump senior adviser Barry Bennett told Fox News. Whether the ouster is simply an effort to smooth over rifts inside the Trump campaign or signals a major shift in strategy remains to be seen. Bennett downplayed the notion that there would be any dramatic changes, but suggested Trump would be talking more about the issues in the weeks ahead. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren in an \"On The Record\" interview he thought the staff change was a \"new direction\" for the Trump campaign. \"I see a pivot and seriousness to the general election,\" he said. Lewandowski has long been a controversial figure in Trump's campaign, but benefited from his proximity to the presumptive Republican nominee. He traveled with Trump on his private plane to nearly every campaign stop, giving him more direct access to the businessman than nearly any other campaign staffer. He was a chief promoter of the idea that the best campaign strategy was to \"Let Trump be Trump.\" He frequently dismissed the notion that Trump needed to hire more experienced political hands, spend on polling and sophisticated data operations, or moderate his rhetoric as he moved toward the general election. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement: \"The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign. The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.\" The decision to part ways followed a rough patch for Trump at a time when he had an opening to crank up his general election operation as presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was still fighting to fend off Bernie Sanders. Instead, Trump\u2019s poll numbers against Clinton slipped, as Trump has found himself caught up in several controversies over his own comments \u2013 in turn stoking tensions with other top Republicans. Aside from the controversies that have hung over the Trump campaign in recent weeks \u2013 including his comments claiming a judge is biased against him in the Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage; his renewed calls for a Muslim immigration ban; and his decision to revoke credentials for The Washington Post \u2013 the campaign is also entering a new and arguably tougher phase as Democratic groups start spending big against him. Clinton and her Democratic allies have invested at least $41 million in commercials in crucial states such as Ohio, Florida and Nevada over the next six weeks. Those messages will be echoed by hundreds of Clinton workers in those same states and amplified by President Obama and other top Democrats. Vice President Biden was also delivering an anti-Trump speech Monday. Fox News\u2019 John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A look at the voters that decided the election NATIONAL Donald Trump\u2019s victory today came as a deeply divided country opted for change. His strength among white voters \u2013 and particularly working-class whites \u2013 led to an impressive performance in the upper Midwest, and he was able to attract enough support from blacks and Hispanics to hold Hillary Clinton at bay. The election was marked by a record gender gap and widespread voter concern about the candidates\u2019 honesty. Trump also weathered concerns about his temperament, qualifications, and treatment of women. Trump won among men by 12 percentage points, while women backed Clinton by 12 points. This 24-point gender gap eclipses the previous record of 22 points, set in the 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Trump dramatically improved on Mitt Romney\u2019s performance among men \u2013 the Republican won by 7 among men in 2012. Clinton only improved slightly on President Barack Obama\u2019s 11-point margin among women. Plus, women made up 52 percent of the electorate, down one point from 2012 and similar to 1996 and 2000 (52 percent). She won blacks by 80 points, down from Obama\u2019s 87-point margin in 2012. Hispanics opted for Clinton by 36 points, a dramatic decrease from Obama\u2019s 44-point win in the last election. Nearly three-in-ten Hispanics (29 percent) voted for Trump, more than the 27 percent Romney received in 2012. Trump won by 21 points among white voters, an uptick from Romney\u2019s 20-point edge in 2012 and the widest Republican margin among whites since at least 1992. White men voted for Trump by 32 points, while white women broke for him by 10 points. Some of Trump\u2019s strongest support came from white voters without a college degree (67 percent) \u2013 and particularly white men without a degree (72 percent). Voters with a college degree favored Clinton by nine points, though college-educated whites went for Trump, 49-45 percent. Trump also ran up big margins among core Republican constituencies, including conservatives (81 percent) and white evangelicals (81 percent). These numbers were comparable to Romney\u2019s performance (82 percent among conservatives, 78 percent among white evangelicals). Democrats made up 37 percent of the electorate and Republicans 33. That is a decrease in the Democratic, when they held a 38-32 percent edge. Union households \u2013 long a stronghold of Democratic support \u2013 went for Clinton by eight points. That\u2019s a 10-point drop from Obama\u2019s total last time, and the lowest union support for a Democrat in the past 20 years. THE CANDIDATES Four-in-ten voters (39 percent) were looking for a candidate who could bring about needed change. These voters favored Trump, 83-14 percent. Clinton won those who wanted a candidate who cares about people like them by 23 points, by 40 among those who prioritized judgment, and by 82 among those who said experience was the most important quality to their vote. After a campaign dominated by various candidate scandals and not the issues, voters had unfavorable opinions of both candidates. Clinton\u2019s favorability was under water by 10 points (44 percent favorable and 54 percent unfavorable). Still, that\u2019s better than views of Trump: 38 percent favorable, 60 percent unfavorable. Voters were put off by Trump\u2019s controversial comments about women. Fully seven-in-ten voters said his treatment of women bothered them. These voters favored Clinton, 65 to 29 percent. Controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state reemerged in the final days of the campaign, and 63 percent of voters were bothered by her email practices. This hurt Clinton, as 70 percent of those bothered by her email scandal went for Trump. Against this backdrop, just 41 percent cast their vote because they strongly favored their candidate. More said they liked their candidate but had reservations (32 percent) or disliked the other candidates (25 percent). Trump\u2019s supporters were split between favoring their candidate (37 percent), liking him but with reservations (33 percent), and voting against Clinton (28 percent). Clinton voters, on the other hand, were more likely to say they favored their candidate (46 percent) than say they liked her with reservations (32 percent) or disliked Trump (21 percent). Voters did not see either candidate as honest and trustworthy, though ratings were slightly better for Clinton (36 percent) than for Trump (33 percent). Clinton was seen as the more qualified candidate and the one with the temperament to lead. Over half (55 percent) of voters said Clinton had the right temperament. Far fewer \u2013 35 percent \u2013 said the same of Trump. Voters had similar evaluations of the candidates\u2019 qualifications: 52 percent said Clinton was qualified for the job, compared to 38 percent who said the same of Trump. MOOD OF THE COUNTRY Trump\u2019s win came as a majority of Americans were dissatisfied (46 percent) or angry (23 percent) with the way the federal government is working. Trump won big among these \u201cangry\u201d voters. Half of the electorate thinks the government is doing too many things better left to business and individuals. That\u2019s about the same as 2012 (51 percent). More than six-in-ten voters have a gloomy assessment of the economy: 41 percent rate the economy as \u201cnot so good\u201d and another 21 percent say \u201cpoor.\u201d Still, that\u2019s an improvement from 2012: 45 percent not so good and 31 percent poor. Although they may not be happy with the way the government is working or the state of the economy, a 53-percent majority approves of the job Obama is doing as president. Bill Clinton left office with a 57-percent approval rating in 2000, while Bush had 27-percent approval in 2008. Despite the president\u2019s approval rating, more voters think the next commander-in-chief should adopt more conservative policies (48 percent) than continue Obama\u2019s policies (28 percent) or adopt more liberal ones (17 percent). E pluribus unum? After an election season that included protests of police use of force against minorities and claims by Trump that the system was rigged against him and his supporters, Americans are deeply divided about the fairness of U.S. institutions. Overall, a 48-point plurality thinks the nation\u2019s criminal justice system is unfair to blacks. Slightly fewer \u2013 43 percent \u2013 think the system is fair to all. Black voters are particularly likely to feel the system treats them unfairly (81 percent). THE ISSUES For more than half of voters (52 percent), the economy is the most important issue facing the country. Far fewer cite terrorism (18 percent), foreign policy (13 percent) and immigration (13 percent). More voters trust Trump to handle the economy: 49-46 percent. Clinton is trusted by more to handle foreign policy, 52-43 percent. For two-in-ten voters (21 percent), appointments to the Supreme Court was the most important issue to their vote. These voters broke for Trump, 56-41 percent. Seven-in-ten voters think illegal immigrants currently working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship (70 percent), rather than being deported (25 percent). In 2012, 65 percent said chance for citizenship and 28 percent favored deportation. Clinton won those who believe illegals should have a chance at citizenship by 26 points. Trump dominated among those who prefer deportation (+70 points). Trump\u2019s signature immigration proposal \u2013 to build a wall along the Mexican border \u2013 received support from 41 percent of voters. Three-in-ten Latinos (29 percent) support the idea. WISCONSIN Trump\u2019s strength among working-class white voters carried him to an upset win in Wisconsin, as he became the first Republican to win the Badger State since 1984. Trump did better among white men (59 percent) than Romney did in 2012 (56 percent). Clinton garnered 48 percent among white women, well below the 53 percent Obama got in 2012. White voters without a college degree proved to be the bulwark of Trump\u2019s support, as he racked up a 63-32 percent win among this group. College-educated whites broke for Clinton by a narrower 10-point margin. Trump\u2019s criticism of NAFTA and other U.S. trade deals played well in Wisconsin. Half of Wisconsin voters think international trade takes away U.S. jobs (50 percent), while 35 percent think it creates jobs. And those who say it takes away jobs heavily favored Trump: 63-32 percent. Union workers have long been a source of support for Democrats in Wisconsin \u2013 two-thirds (66%) voted for Obama in 2012. But Trump cut into this margin, as Clinton only won 52 percent of the union vote. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and the subsequent FBI investigation also played a big role: 66 percent of Wisconsin voters said Clinton\u2019s email practices bothered them. These voters broke for Trump by a 50-point margin. Trump spent time in Wisconsin toward the end of the campaign. That, combined with the FBI\u2019s additional investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails, may have tipped the state into Trump\u2019s column. He won a majority of late-deciding voters. OHIO As Ohio goes, so goes the nation: the last seven Republicans who have won the state have won the presidency. Donald Trump flipped the state into the Republican column this year. Trump\u2019s criticism of international trade played particularly well in Ohio. Nearly half of Ohio voters (48 percent) think trade with other countries takes away jobs, compared 32 percent who think it creates jobs. Those who think trade hurts jobs broke for Trump by 67-29 percent margin. His message on trade also appears to have helped him among union voters. He won a majority of union members \u2013 52 percent \u2013 a dramatic improvement over the 37 percent Romney took home in 2012. White evangelical voters made up one-third of the electorate (33 percent), up from 31 percent last time around. Trump made major inroads among these voters, winning 76 percent \u2013 an improvement on Romney\u2019s 69 percent. In 2012, Obama won among voters without a college degree, 53-46 percent. This year, that dynamic flipped: Trump won those without college degrees by 4 points. He won college graduates by eight points. Clinton was also hurt by a downturn in support from black voters. While African-Americans turned out (they made up 14 percent of the electorate this year and 15 percent in 2012), she won 90 percent of them \u2013 down from Obama\u2019s 96-percent win. FLORIDA Trump won the Sunshine State thanks to an uptick in support among non-white voters. The white share of the electorate has continued to decline \u2013 from 71 percent in 2008, to 67 percent in 2012, and 62 percent this year. Trump won Florida\u2019s white voters by 31 points. Trump racked up large margins among both college-educated whites (+27 points) and working class whites (+35 points). Florida\u2019s Latino voters turned out in force, accounting for 19 percent of all voters, up from 17 percent last time around. Clinton won 63 percent of Latinos, up from the 60 percent that Obama won in 2012. Trump won by 13 points among Florida\u2019s sizable Cuban-American population, a dramatic reversal of Obama\u2019s two-point win in 2012. Trump also doubled the support Romney received from black voters, tallying 8 percent this year. Nearly half of all Floridians felt Obama\u2019s signature health care law went too far (46 percent). Trump won these voters by a whopping 78-17 margin. Florida has a large share of seniors, a group that favored Trump by 18 percentage points. Seniors went for Romney by 17 points in 2012. NORTH CAROLINA With the first African-American president no longer on the ballot, the electorate in North Carolina was less diverse than in 2012 \u2013 which led to a win for Trump. White voters made up 71 percent of the electorate this year, and broke for Trump by 30 points. Trump amassed huge wins among working-class whites (+44 points) and white evangelicals (+64 points). The \u201cObama coalition\u201d did not warm to Clinton. She underperformed among both non-whites and young voters. Blacks accounted for 19 percent of the electorate, down from 23 percent in 2012. While Clinton won blacks by 83 points, that was a decrease from Obama\u2019s 92-point margin. Clinton\u2019s margin among Hispanics (+20 points) was also a notable drop from Obama\u2019s 37-point margin in 2012. Young voters propelled Obama to victory in North Carolina in 2008 and kept the state close in 2012 \u2013 but Clinton won 60 percent of the young vote this year, well off the 67 percent Obama won last time. Racial tensions in North Carolina came to the forefront this year after the killing of a black man by Charlotte police officers in September and allegations that the state curtailed blacks\u2019 access to early voting. Voters were divided on whether the justice system treats all people fairly (41 percent) or treats blacks unfairly (47 percent). Most blacks (81 percent) feel the system treats them unfairly. COLORADO The changing Colorado electorate provided Clinton a much-needed swing state win. She benefitted from strong support among Latinos, young voters and newcomers to the state. Latino voters accounted for 13 percent of the Colorado electorate, down from 14 percent in 2012. Clinton won Hispanics by 40 points, down from Obama\u2019s 52-point margin last time. Trump won among white voters, 45-42 percent. Clinton racked up a sizable 10-point win among young voters. Seniors split: 49 percent for Clinton, 47 percent for Trump. Roughly six-in-ten Colorado voters were not born in the state. Clinton won these non-natives by seven points. Trump won Colorado\u2019s sizable collection of independent voters by three points. Romney won independents by four points in 2012. Trump was out of step with Coloradans on immigration. By more than four to one, more voters believe illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should have a chance at citizenship (78 percent) than think they should be deported (16 percent). Voters who favor a path to citizenship broke for Clinton by 25 points. Nearly one-third of Colorado voters (31 percent) are angry with the way the government is working these days. These \u201cangry\u201d voters overwhelmingly supported Trump (67-18 percent). Trump also won big among Colorado\u2019s rural voters (+20 points).

            "article_content": "Officer Joe Gliniewicz was shot twice with his own weapon This Labor Day weekend marks one year since Fox Lake, Illinois Police Lieutenant Joe Gliniewicz staged his on-the-job suicide to look like murder\u2014sparking a massive investigation and nationwide manhunt for three \"killers\" who didn\u2019t exist. Fox Lake officials are still picking up the pieces of the stunning event. \u201cIt was a betrayal to the profession and the community,\u201d Chris Covelli, a Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office detective, told FoxNews.com. On Sept. 1, 2015, 52-year-old Gliniewicz radioed in from a rural area of Fox Lake that he was getting out of his cruiser to check on three suspicious men, two white and one black. A short while later Gliniewicz was found shot to death, one bullet hitting his bulletproof vest, the other striking him below the vest, near his heart. His glasses and other belongings were found strewn around the swampy area, leading investigators to believe the officer engaged in some type of struggle. Melodie Gliniewicz in September 2015. (Patrick Kunzer/ Daily Herald via AP, File) However, in a stunning twist, police discovered Gliniewicz carefully staged his suicide to look like murder. Investigators learned the corrupt cop apparently caved under the pressure of living a shocking double life for nearly two decades. \"It's unheard of in our profession that anyone would think to do something like that and it just shows the emotional state that he must have been in over all of this and knowing that we were getting closer to finding out what was really going on,\" said Fox Lake Village Administrator, Anne Marrin. According to investigators, Gliniewicz embezzled tens of thousands of dollars from the Fox Lake Explorer program, the 'police academy for teens' he was hailed as a hero for managing for years. Police say Gliniewicz used the money for vacations, car repairs and even adult websites. It was also discovered Gliniewicz had extramarital affairs and arranged for his own mistress to marry his son in order to gain added military benefits. Perhaps the biggest bombshell was that Gliniewicz contacted a hit man to have Marrin murdered. \"It's crazy. I can't describe it any other way,\u201d Marrin said. Marrin is credited with discovering Gliniewicz's corruption by asking the officer for paperwork to account for the spending and inventory of the Explorer program. Following Gliniewicz's death, his wife Melodie immediately declared her husband a hero and murder victim. However, through the massive federal and state investigation, officers concluded Melodie Gliniewicz was a partner in her husband's crimes. The pair even took an estimated $9,000 vacation to Hawaii -- allegedly on the Explorer program's dime. Earlier this year Melodie Gliniewicz was\u00a0indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy, felony money laundering and misuse of charitable funds. She awaits trail. Attorneys for Gliniewicz say she is innocent and is a victim of her husband's schemes. Melodie Gliniewicz also filed for her husband's pension, a total of $1.5 million in payments over 20 years, according to Marrin. The village pension board has approved a motion to withhold a decision on payment until after Melodie's criminal trial. In addition to the embezzled funds, the couple obtained a substantial amount of military equipment including vehicles, helmets and vests through\u00a0the 1033 Program, according to investigators. The federal program gives unused and dated military equipment to needy police departments. Following Gliniewicz 's death, Marrin led the tedious task of itemizing each item Gliniewicz received. Marrin tells FoxNews.com the village has given items like flashlights and traffic cones to its police department. Military items have been placed in an inventory and will be returned. The death of Gliniewicz came amid tensions between police and citizens in communities around the country and in the midst of the \"Blue Lives Matter\" movement. Marrin says Gliniewicz's death marred that police support. \"Because of the betrayal, nationwide, it was a terrible thing that message was lost,\" Marrin said.\u00a0\"The worst part fell upon our police department. They had to carry the stigma of what that wayward officer did and that's unfair.\"",

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a charity gala organized by the Archdiocese of New York, Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (The Associated Press) Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, right, reacts as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner, Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT): 12:25 p.m. Hillary Clinton has a new ad featuring the Muslim-American father of a U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. The father, Khizr Khan, was repeatedly criticized by Donald Trump after Khan spoke at the Democratic National Convention. In the ad provided by a Clinton campaign official, Khan talks about his son, Capt. Humayun Khan. He says his son sought to protect his unit from a suicide bomber. He concludes by asking: \"Mr. Trump, would my son have a place in your America?\" The ad will air in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. ___ 12:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton appears to be displaying strength in the crucial battleground states of North Carolina and Florida among voters casting ballots before Election Day. Data compiled by The Associated Press show she may also be building an early vote advantage in Arizona and Colorado. Donald Trump, meanwhile, appears to be holding ground in Ohio, Iowa and Georgia. Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina. More than 4.2 million early votes have been cast, far outpacing the rate for this period in 2012. Balloting is under way in 34 out of 37 early-voting states. In all, more than 45 million people are expected to vote before Election Day. ___ 11:55 a.m. Hillary Clinton plans to meet with Black Lives Matter activists in Cleveland. Clinton's campaign said Friday that Clinton will meet with two activists before an early voting event in Cleveland. A campaign aide said they will discuss how to \"advance equity and opportunity in the African-American community.\" The Democratic presidential candidate has promised to work on race and criminal justice issues, including reforming the justice system, improving relationships between police and communities and improving education and job opportunities. Clinton has drawn scrutiny over husband Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill. Critics say that resulted in mass incarceration disproportionately affecting blacks. Bill Clinton, who has tangled with protesters over the issue, has acknowledged the legislation contributed to high incarceration rates of black people for nonviolent crimes. ___ 10:35 a.m. A new ad promoting Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire says she's needed in the Senate \"no matter who the next president is.\" The ad by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce shows a tactic Republicans could use widely if Donald Trump continues to sink in the polls. If his loss seems inevitable Republican down-ballot candidates may start asking voters to return them to Washington to act as a check and balance against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Chamber ad doesn't make that explicit argument, but opens with an image of an empty debate stage as the narrator says: \"America's future is far from certain, but no matter who the next president is, New Hampshire needs a strong voice in the U.S. Senate.\" The ad was first reported by CNN. ___ 7:50 a.m. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan says there were \"touching moments\" between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton at a charity dinner that was otherwise marked by barbed remarks by the presidential candidates. Dolan told NBC's \"Today show\" Friday that at one point at the dinner, Trump leaned in and told Clinton: \"You are one tough and talented woman.\" According to Dolan, Clinton responded by saying: \"Whatever happens, we need to work together afterward.\" Both candidates attended the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner on Thursday. That is a white-tie gala in New York that is often the last time the two presidential nominees share a stage before Election Day. At the dinner, Dolan called his seat between Trump and Clinton the \"iciest place on earth.\" ___ 3:30 a.m. Donald Trump is stepping back only slightly from his refusal to say during his debate with Hillary Clinton whether he would concede if he loses on Election Day. Trump now says he will accept \"a clear election result\" but still reserves his right to \"contest or file a legal challenge\" if he loses \u2014 and he says he won't lose. Republicans and Democrats alike criticize Trump over an attitude some contend strikes at the heart of American democracy. While Trump maintains he will win, numerous Republican leaders concede that he is heading for defeat barring a significant shift in the campaign's closing days. The GOP's top concern is turning to salvaging its majority in the Senate, followed closely by worries over the Republicans' once comfortable grip on the House.",

Fox News Election Headquarters opens for business at 6 p.m. ET, bringing viewers the latest news as Americans register their votes for Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic standard bearer Hillary Clinton. Top Fox News Channel personalities and pundits will helm the desks of Studio F, illuminated in red, white and blue and visible from New York City\u2019s Avenue of the Americas. The two-story studio will bring Fox News Channel viewers all the latest information as America picks its next president. \u201cThis race has captured the imagination of the entire country,\u201d Hemmer, anchor of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d said. \u201cFor us, we have been on the story every day for 15 months. It\u2019s finally here, and we have given it -- what we believe -- an appropriate new home.\u201d Under a 29-foot ceiling, Studio F is home to 46 monitors, each pumping out more than 100 million pixels to bring the night to life for the viewers at home. Broadcast veteran Hemmer has seen many studios, but never one quite like Studio F. \u201cWe have so many different screens to display information on and so many different ways to give the producers opportunities to tell the story,\u201d Fox News Senior Vice President of Technology & Operations Warren Vandeveer said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t technology just for technology\u2019s sake -- these screens are all real estate to put information in.\u201d Months of planning and coordination went in to installing the sleek new studio in space at the base of the News Corp building. \u201cWhat we built here is a very dynamic environment, so the way we are able to present the election results is going to be very clear,\u201d Fox News Vice President of Broadcast Technology Peter Blangiforti said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the accomplishment.\u201d Fox News Channel personalities and pundits will bring all the latest to viewers around the world. Tonight, under the 528-square-foot video chandelier, viewers will see Bret Baier and Megyn Kelly leading the coverage, with Martha MacCallum presenting the latest exit poll data from the massive media wall, standing 9 feet tall and 30 feet wide. Just off camera lies the nerve center -- a state-of-the-art control room where Fox News producers employ the latest technology to bring information and stunning graphics into living rooms around the nation. Just up the tempered-glass stairs is the Fox News Data Deck, where Hemmer will manage his video billboard, joined by top analysts who will break down the numbers as polls close and returns come in. Shannon Bream will join Hemmer on the balcony, keeping an eye on what people are posting on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this studio grow from infancy to the big unveiling tonight,\u201d Fox News Election Headquarters Line Producer Valeria Riccioli told FoxNews.com. \u201cOur biggest task has been to make sure we don\u2019t get lost in the technology and make sure it functions editorially. The possibilities in this studio are endless.\u201d Fox News Senior Executive Producer Alan Komissaroff said the studio must live up to a dramatic and tumultuous election, between two candidates who captivated the public and generated unprecedented controversy. \u201cEither you have Donald Trump, this guy who no one even thought would be the nominee -- much less this close to the presidency -- going to the White House,\u201d Komissaroff said. \u201cOr, you have Hillary Clinton, the first female president, the wife of such a storied president in Bill Clinton. Either way, it\u2019s a big story.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump and Clinton release medical details amid growing debate The presidential race is tight. \u00a0Hillary Clinton tops Donald Trump by just one point among likely voters in the four-way ballot. \u00a0In the head-to-head matchup, Trump\u2019s up by one point. Clinton receives 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 40 percent, according to a new Fox News Poll, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 8 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 3 percent. In a two-way matchup, likely voters give Trump the edge over Clinton: 46-45 percent. The poll, released Thursday, was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings, at a time when Clinton faced new questions about her health after falling ill at a 9/11 memorial event. It\u2019s the first Fox News Poll this season that includes results among likely voters, so a direct comparison can\u2019t be made to previous polls. An apples-to-apples comparison is possible among registered voters, and the two-way vote trend shows the race has definitely tightened: \u00a0Clinton was up by 10 points at the beginning of August (49-39 percent). \u00a0By the end of August she was up 6 points (48-42 percent) -- and now she\u2019s up by just 3 points (46-43 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS Likely voters are those registered voters who report a high probability they will cast a presidential ballot this year. \u00a0At this point, fewer non-white and younger voters are saying they intend to vote compared to other groups -- and that hurts Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s clear what the Clinton campaign needs to do, and that\u2019s make sure non-white and younger voters show up on Election Day,\u201d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. \u00a0\u201cIf these traditional Democratic voters turn out at past rates, she probably wins.\u201d Both tickets have the backing of most of their key voting blocs. \u00a0In the four-way race, Trump has the advantage among white evangelical Christians (+52 points), whites without a college degree (+31), and men (+13). Clinton is preferred among non-whites (+51 points), women (+13), and those voters living in households earning less than $50,000 (+16). Independents prefer Trump over Clinton by 36-31 percent, while 16 percent go for Johnson and 7 percent Stein. \u00a0Eighty percent of Republicans back Trump, and 81 percent of Democrats support Clinton. \"Lately Trump\u2019s avoided the sort of controversy that undermined his efforts throughout August,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Anderson. \"By allowing Clinton's problems to be the story, he may finally be consolidating Republican support.\" Fewer Democrats (77 percent) than Republicans (86 percent) are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d interested in the presidential election right now. Even so, supporters on both sides are about equally enthusiastic about their candidate. \u00a0Almost all of those backing Clinton feel certain they\u2019ll vote for her in November (87 percent) and say it\u2019s important to them she win (91 percent). \u00a0That\u2019s matched among Trump supporters, as they overwhelmingly say they\u2019re certain to vote for him (90 percent) and it\u2019s important he win (87 percent). In addition, 53 percent of Clinton\u2019s backers strongly favor her, while 24 percent have some reservations. \u00a0For Trump, 50 percent strongly favor him and 27 percent have reservations. \u00a0On both sides, about one in five says their support is driven by dislike of the other candidate. Seven in ten voters don\u2019t like the way the government is working, including 44 percent who are dissatisfied and 27 percent who are \u201cangry.\u201d Over half would go even further: \u00a057 percent say the world\u2019s \u201cgoing to hell in a handbasket.\u201d \u201cAngry\u201d voters prefer Trump over Clinton (by 54 points), as do \u201chandbasket\u201d voters (by 35 points). That\u2019s driven by the fact that Republicans are nearly three times as likely as Democrats to feel angry about the way the government is working, and about twice as likely to feel the world\u2019s going to hell. Likely voters trust Trump over Clinton on handling the economy (+7 points) and corruption in government (+11). They favor Clinton on race relations (+24 points), immigration (+5), nominating the next Supreme Court justice (+1), and terrorism/national security (+1). On immigration, while there\u2019s been some back-and-forth on Trump\u2019s position on deportation, he\u2019s been consistent on building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \u00a0Over half of likely voters disagree with the GOP nominee and oppose building a wall. \u00a0The same is true among registered voters, which is a change in sentiment. \u00a0In the past, half or better favored the wall. \u00a0That shift is mainly due to a double-digit increase in opposition among Democrats. Seven-in-ten Republicans favor the wall, and a recent Fox News Poll found nearly three in ten favor deporting as many illegal immigrants as possible (August 28-30). The new poll finds many voters think those favoring deportation are motivated by racism (37 percent say racism is a major factor in favoring deportation and 32 percent minor factor). Pollpourri Among registered voters: -- Republicans split over their nominee, as 50 percent are happy with Trump, while 48 percent wish it were someone else. \u00a0That\u2019s mostly unchanged since June. -- 52 percent of Democrats are happy with Clinton at the top of their ticket. \u00a0That\u2019s down from 58 percent in June. \u00a0Forty-three percent would rather have Bernie Sanders, up from 37 percent. -- 12 percent of Republicans who preferred someone else as their nominee defect to Clinton in the four-way ballot. \u00a0Only five percent of Sanders backers back Trump. The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from September 11-14, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 867 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Get ready: Voting in the 2016 election is now underway. Advance voting begins Friday in North Carolina, the first of 37 states that will allow balloting by mail for any reason or in person before the actual Election Day of Nov. 8. It's part of a nearly nine-week campaign frenzy in which millions of voters will have the ability to fill out a ballot and be done with the 2016 presidential race. North Carolina residents are first, and they can now submit absentee ballots by mail without an excuse. They also will be able to vote early at polling booths beginning Oct. 20. In a possible sign of increased interest, 34,788 voters as of Friday had requested absentee ballots, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, up from about 25,600 from a similar timeframe in 2012. Broken down by party, the requests were somewhat evenly divided -- 37 percent Democrat to 35 percent Republican and 28 percent who were unaffiliated with a party. Ballots were being mailed Friday with votes likely to start arriving in the coming days. \"North Carolina's voters are among the first in the nation to make their voices heard in this election,\" said State Board of Elections Executive Director Kim Westbrook Strach. \"With high turnout expected, we encourage voters to consider all their voting options.\" While no votes will be counted until Nov. 8, many states such as North Carolina report the party affiliation of people who have cast ballots, offering solid clues. Ballots from all 50 states will be sent to members of the armed services and voters living abroad the week of Sept. 19. And Georgia residents may also begin mailing in ballots that week, followed by battlegrounds Wisconsin and Virginia. Iowa will accept early ballots starting Sept. 29, three days after the first presidential debate. \"If one campaign does significantly better in harvesting early votes, that campaign will have a substantial advantage as election day approaches,\" said Paul Gronke, a Reed College professor and director of the Early Voting Information Center in Portland, Oregon. The stakes are high: Voters who cast ballots in advance are expected to make up between 50 to 75 percent or more of all ballots in the battlegrounds of North Carolina, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. Nationwide, about 45.6 million people or roughly 35 percent of the electorate attracted by its convenience voted prior to Election Day in 2012, and that number is expected to increase in 2016. The campaigns know it, too. Hillary Clinton appeared in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday and applauded a recent federal appeals court decision invalidating restrictions that the judges determined made it harder for non-whites to vote. \"Get out and vote and make it clear we're not putting up with that,\" she said. The Clinton campaign said Friday it was planning a series of events this month aimed at boosting turnout, including a nationwide \"weekend of action\" on Sept. 17 and 18 focused on voter registration and mobilization. Clinton hosted a call with campus organizers and supporters Thursday to help mobilize efforts. Next week, President Barack Obama will visit Philadelphia and First Lady Michelle Obama will be in northern Virginia to drum up support. The Trump campaign, working with the Republican National Committee to boost absentee mail balloting in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Iowa, described its early efforts as key to a \"path to victory.\" The campaign has made it clear it will work hard for every vote but also stressed the billionaire's appeal to a \"silent majority that's had enough.\" Its total number of field offices is fewer than half what Clinton has, though it's been expanding. \"We must reach every voter before early voting and Election Day,\" wrote campaign manager Kellyanne Conway in a Sept. 5 memo.",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. We jumped the shark on this campaign a long time ago. First, there was the hostile takeover of the Republican Party by a candidate with no qualifications to be president, given to shaming women about their looks, insulting Mexicans, and even demeaning a former prisoner of war, himself a former GOP presidential nominee, for getting captured. Then the American press played stupid. They equated one candidate\u2019s reckless use of a private email server with the other candidate\u2019s litany of disrepute \u2014 his reported failure to pay taxes; his insults of a Gold Star family; charges that he regularly groped women; as well as federal charges of racial bias against black people trying to rent apartments. Oh, and don\u2019t forget charges of fraud at Trump University and the stories \u2014 never convincingly rebutted \u2014 of his corrupt use of money intended for charity. Along this twisted road to elect a president, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia is trying to influence the election by attacking one candidate. And when \u2014 days before the election \u2014 the FBI director took a shot at the same candidate, the 2016 campaign totally went off the rails. By that, I mean it went past all bounds of my prior experience with hardball political campaigns over the last 40 years. The smart money is still on a Hillary Clinton victory. The bettors in Las Vegas and the polling/statistical analytics crowd have her as the favorite to seal the deal. But her lead in the polls \u2013 both nationally and in the battleground states \u2013 has dwindled in the last week. The nation is still shaking its collective head over FBI director James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress stirring new suspicion about Clinton, without charges of misconduct or any evidence. The FBI\u2019s credibility has been damaged. That damage has not been repaired by Comey's statement on Sunday, stating that the new emails had not changed his earlier conclusion that Clinton's deeds did not rise to the level of prosecutable offenses. The actual election won\u2019t end the craziness. This year\u2019s campaign is just the latest chapter in years of polarized, dysfunctional national politics. So as you watch Fox News for election coverage on Tuesday night, here is a viewer\u2019s guide. As we begin the contest, Clinton dominates the map. States that would be safe for any Democratic nominee give her just under 200 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Then there are four states very likely to add to her total \u2014 Virginia and the Midwestern trio of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. If she can add Electoral College votes from Pennsylvania and New Hampshire \u2014 20 from the former and four from the latter \u2014 she is on the brink of victory. Either Colorado or Nevada would carry her over the finish line. Any sign that Donald Trump might grab one of those states threatens Clinton\u2019s path to early victory. Pay particular attention to\u00a0Virginia.\u00a0An early call that Clinton has won the state is a good sign for her in states with lots of college-educated whites and strong racial diversity \u2014 read that as auguring well for her chances in Colorado too. Also keep an eye on\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0where the polls close at 7 p.m. The state has voted Republican in every presidential election for the last two decades. But Trump\u2019s toxicity with racial minorities has given Democrats reason to believe they can do well. Trump holds the lead in polls. A close race here is bad news for him while a quick call for him will cheer his backers. Staying in the south, there will be much attention paid to\u00a0Florida\u00a0and\u00a0North Carolina. Florida is critical with 29 electoral votes but it is never an early call because part of the state is on central time. The Tar Heel state, however, is likely to be an early bellwether. Polls close there at 7:30 p.m. As of Sunday, the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state showed a small advantage for Trump. Texas\u00a0is on my list for fun.\u00a0The state has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976. But Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric about Latinos has given Democrats new hope in the state with the second largest share of Hispanics in the nation: 39 percent. Polls show Trump leading but home-state Sen. Ted Cruz beat him in the state\u2019s GOP primary by 17 points. Stay up late to keep an eye on\u00a0Utah.\u00a0Trump can\u2019t afford to lose a solid GOP state. But some recent polls show that independent candidate Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and a Mormon, is competitive with Trump and Clinton. If McMullin wins, he will be the first third party candidate to claim electoral votes since George Wallace in 1968. Arizona\u00a0is worth watching too, because the Democrats see the state as their best hope for an election night shocker. Since September, Clinton has spent over $1 million on ads in the state, where 31 percent of the population is Hispanic. One indication that Clinton has a chance: she nabbed the endorsement of the state\u2019s largest newspaper, the Arizona Republic, which has never endorsed a Democrat for president since it began publishing in 1890. Get out the popcorn, start Tweeting and watch the returns come in. This is politics as soap opera or World Wrestling Federation \u2014 entertaining but at the end disheartening. When all is said and done, 2016 remains the year that American politics jumped the shark.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz reacts to members of the media attempting to justify why their reporting is so negative towards Donald Trump The media\u2019s legions of Trump-bashers are finally acknowledging the obvious. And trying their best to justify it. But there\u2019s one problem: Tilting against one candidate in a presidential election can\u2019t be justified. This is not a defense of Donald Trump, who has been at war with much of the press since he got in the race. Too many people think if you criticize the way the billionaire is being covered, you are somehow backing Trump. And it\u2019s not about the commentators, on the right as well as the left, who are savaging Trump, since they are paid for their opinions. This is about the mainstream media\u2019s reporters, editors and producers, whose credo is supposed to be fairness. And now some of them are flat-out making the case for unfairness\u2014an unprecedented approach for an unprecedented campaign. Put aside, for the moment, the longstanding complaints about journalists being unfair to Republicans. They never treated Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush or Bob Dole like this. Keep in mind that the media utterly misjudged Trump from the start, covering him as a joke or a sideshow or a streaking comet that would burn itself out. Many of them later confessed how wrong they had been, and that they had missed the magnitude of the anger and frustration that fueled Trump\u2019s unlikely rise. But since the conventions, and fueled by his own missteps, Trump has been hit by a tsunami of negative coverage, all but swamping the reporting on Hillary Clinton. Liberal investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald recently told Slate that \u201cthe U.S. media is essentially 100 percent united, vehemently, against Trump, and preventing him from being elected president\u201d\u2014and, given his views, he has no problem with that. Now comes Jim Rutenberg, in his first season as media columnist for the New York Times. He\u2019s a good reporter and I give him credit for trying to openly grapple with this bizarre situation. But Rutenberg is, in my view, trying to defend the indefensible: \u201cIf you view a Trump presidency as something that\u2019s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you\u2019ve ever been to being oppositional. That\u2019s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, nonopinion journalist I\u2019ve ever known, and by normal standards, untenable.\u201d Yet normal standards, says Rutenberg, may not apply. By \u201ccloser to being oppositional,\u201d he means openly siding against Trump and thereby helping Clinton. And that\u2019s precisely the kind of thing that erodes our already damaged credibility. If a reporter believes Trump is a threat to America, he or she should go into the opinion business, or quit the media world and work against him. You can\u2019t maintain the fig leaf of neutral reporting and favor one side. Rutenberg acknowledges that \u201cbalance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy. For the primaries and caucuses, the imbalance played to his advantage, captured by the killer statistic of the season: His nearly $2 billion in free media was more than six times as much as that of his closest Republican rival.\u201d I have to push back on this $2-billion argument. Trump got more coverage not just because he was good for clicks and ratings, but because he did many, many times more interviews than anyone else running. Much of this \u201cfree\u201d media, rather than being a gift, was harshly negative. But that too helped Trump, because he drove the campaign dialogue and openly campaigned against the press. Next Rutenberg argues that Trump is just too over the top in his rhetoric: \u201cAnd while coded appeals to racism or nationalism aren\u2019t new \u2014 two words: Southern strategy \u2014 overt calls to temporarily bar Muslims from entry to the United States or questioning a federal judge\u2019s impartiality based on his Mexican heritage are new.\u201d What\u2019s disappointing is that Rutenberg doesn\u2019t cite a single example of biased coverage from his paper, or any other paper or news outlet. (He does point to criticism from MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who is, as the columnist acknowledges, a commentator.) Instead he quotes Carolyn Ryan, the Times\u2019 senior editor for politics, as saying Trump\u2019s candidacy is \u201cextraordinary and precedent-shattering\u201d and \u201cto pretend otherwise is to be disingenuous with readers.\u201d And Rutenberg agrees, saying it would \u201cbe an abdication of political journalism\u2019s most solemn duty: to ferret out what the candidates will be like in the most powerful office in the world.\u201d No one wants to abdicate that duty. No one is pretending Trump\u2019s candidacy isn\u2019t extraordinary. No one is saying he shouldn\u2019t be fully vetted. But there is an assumption among many journalists and pundits that of course Hillary Clinton is qualified, she\u2019s been around forever, she just doesn\u2019t need the relentless reporting that Trump requires. And so critical stories about Clinton\u2014even when she said she \u201cshort-circuited\u201d in that Chris Wallace interview on the email mess\u2014are overshadowed by the endless piling on Trump. Many of the reporters who feel compelled to stop Trump are undoubtedly comfortable because all their friends feel the same way. But they are deluding themselves if they think that going after one candidate in a two-candidate race is what journalism is about.",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on the Senate votes on gun control legislation (all times Eastern): 3:45 p.m. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte says she will support a Democratic amendment to allow the government to ban the sale of guns to suspected terrorists, a reversal after voting against a similar version in December. Ayotte, who is in a tough re-election race in New Hampshire, says she will vote for the amendment sponsored by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She'll also back a Republican alternative to delay gun sales to suspected terrorist for 72 hours, but require court action to block the sale permanently. Ayotte says she is working with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine on a compromise. That version would prohibit the sale of guns to terrorism suspects who are on the government's no-fly list and allow an appeals process for those who may be mistakenly on the list. New Hampshire is home to some of the nation's most lenient gun laws, but Ayotte's approval rating fell after she voted against expanding background checks following the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. ___ 2:30 p.m. A top Republican is rejecting a potential compromise on gun control negotiated by moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday that Collins' proposal is problematic because it would immediately prohibit the sale of guns to people on the government's no fly list \u2014 even those mistakenly identified as terrorism suspects. Cornyn says the appeals process in the bill comes too late. The Senate is voting Monday on an amendment from Cornyn to allow the government to delay a gun sale to a suspected terrorist for 72 hours, but require court action to block the sale permanently. It's unclear if Collins' legislation will get a vote. Cornyn said that \"any time you are denying an American citizen their constitutional rights it ought to be with evidence.\" He says the \"burden ought to be on the government and it ought to come from a court.\" A spokeswoman for Collins says the bill has \"thorough and robust\" protections for those who may mistakenly be on the list.",

            "article_content": "AP (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) Can money buy an election? Hillary Clinton better hope so. Thanks to Director Comey\u2019s bombshell announcement that the FBI is reopening the investigation into Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information, a close race will almost surely tighten further. Hillary goes into the home stretch under pressure, with lagging enthusiasm and falling \u201cfavorables\u201d, but with this to fall back on: piles of cash. Comey\u2019s announcement may cause a shift in the polls, but the more important impact could be on turnout. By reminding Americans of what they most dislike about Hillary Clinton \u2013 the scandals that trail her like a sulfurous cloud \u2013 the renewed FBI probe could cause tepid Hillary supporters to stay home. At the same time, it arguably reenergizes the Trump camp, whose followers have been depressed by sinking polls and the media\u2019s suggestion that the race was already decided. Throughout the campaign, the Clinton camp has worried that the so-called Obama coalition would simply not show up; surrogates including President and Mrs. Obama have repeatedly urged blacks, in particular, to vote. There are signs that those fears were well founded. In North Carolina, for example, black voting is lagging 2012 levels. Similarly, a brand new poll shows Clinton\u2019s advantage over Millenials shrinking. Elsewhere, the New York Times reports Clinton has a slim edge in several toss-up states, and acknowledges that she has a \u201clarge organizational advantage.\u201d That advantage is the result of a sturdy years-long Democratic program dedicated to voter turnout, and also the Trump camp\u2019s refusal to invest in the nuts-and-bolts efforts so critical to national campaigns. Hillary\u2019s ground game, fueled by her constant schmoozing with billionaire donors, could make the difference in this election. For all that she rails at the evils of \u201cdark money\u201d on the campaign trail, Hillary and her SuperPacs have raised over one billion dollars in this election cycle, compared to only $512 million for Trump. \u00a0In the first three weeks of October, Clinton kept up a relentless fund-raising program, pulling in $52 million compared to Trump\u2019s $29 million. Even after a heavy bout of advertising, Clinton\u2019s campaign ended the period with $62 million left in the kitty while Trump had only $16 million. So strapped is his team that Trump has announced that he is writing a ten million dollar check to his campaign; he may need it. Ironically, with Hillary clearly ahead in the polls for the last two weeks, her campaign seemed to have briefly taken its foot off the accelerator. In these closing days, and after months of being outspent 3:1, Trump was set to spend slightly more than his Democrat rival on TV ads for the first time ($14.4 million vs. $13.9 million).\u00a0 Trump\u2019s camp, in a last-ditch effort, is ramping up its TV presence in swing states Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. By contrast, Clinton\u2019s team for the first time bought more than $100,000 in ads to air in Wisconsin, where most polls show she has a secure lead of five or six points. Her Wisconsin campaign director explained that the ads were designed in part to boost other Democrats like former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold who is battling incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. Clinton\u2019s team is also dedicating millions to Indiana and Missouri, where Trump has a comfortable lead but where senate seats are up for grabs. Taking control of the Senate is a high priority for Democrats; Hillary\u2019s campaign apparently thought she could afford to share her wealth. Even more surprising was the Clinton camp\u2019s modest ad buy in Texas, a red state for generations, but where the Dallas Morning News, for the first time since 1936, endorsed the Democratic candidate. It seemed that Hillary was almost taunting Trump, and hoping he would divert his scarce resources to what is normally a Republican stronghold. Now the tables are turned, and Hillary will have to refocus her millions on the get-out-the vote push. There is no question Clinton\u2019s field operation tops Trump\u2019s. In Ohio she has 300 staffers while Trump has fewer than half that number. In Florida, as of September, Trump had one office to Clinton\u2019s 51. These \u00a0\u00a0advantages will make or break Clinton now. Clinton\u2019s hefty checking account will fund more phone banks, more flyers and more buses to deliver supporters to the polling places on Election Day. Will it be enough? Obama adviser David Axelrod said in an interview that Clinton\u2019s ground game and consequent advantage in turning out voters could add 1 to 3 percent in swing states. As we head into the home stretch, with a number of states within the margin of error, that could make the difference. The songwriters could be wrong: maybe money can buy you love.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry on Thursday urged his party to fight for the African-American vote and said black families should hold Democrats accountable for what he called decades of unsuccessful anti-poverty programs. \"I am here to tell you that it is Republicans, not Democrats, who are truly offering black Americans the hope of a better life for themselves and their children,\" the former Texas governor said in a speech focused largely on race. Perry is the latest White House hopeful to weigh in on the racial divide, an emerging theme in the 2016 presidential contest. President Barack Obama last week addressed race when he eulogized a South Carolina state senator who was among nine African-Americans shot to death in a Charleston church. Perry did not echo the president's call for South Carolina to taken down the Confederate flag flying on the Statehouse grounds, saying that was a decision for the people of South Carolina. He did promote policies such as education reform, Medicaid grants to give states more control over health care programs and sentencing laws that keep nonviolent drug offenders out of prison. \"I am proud to live in a country with an African-American president. But President Obama cannot be proud of the fact that the prevalence of black poverty has actually increased under his leadership,\" Perry said, while acknowledging that his party has \"much to do to earn the trust of African-Americans.\" Perry is among the dozen-plus Republicans competing for the nomination. The GOP has struggled with black voters since Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. No Republican has earned more than 15 percent of the black vote in a presidential election since 1960. \"When we gave up on trying to win the support of African-Americans, we lost our moral legitimacy as the party of Lincoln -- as the party of equal opportunity for all,\" Perry said. He said the country should not dismiss \"the historical legacy of slavery, nor its role in causing the problem of black poverty.\" \"And because slavery and segregation were sanctioned by government, there is a role for government policy in addressing their lasting effects,\" he said.",

Those divisions are laid bare in the split reactions to the decisions by two grand juries not to indict white police officers who killed unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y. Both times, protesters responded with outrage and politicians called for federal investigations. Yet Americans don't think of the cases as a matched set of injustices, the poll found. A majority agreed with the Ferguson decision, while most objected to the conclusion in the Staten Island death, which was captured on video. The divergent opinions-52 percent agreed on Ferguson compared with 25 percent who approved of the Staten Island outcome.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou know when you're dealing with something as deeply rooted as racism or bias in any society, you got to have vigilance; you have to recognize that it's going to take some time and you just have to be steady so that you don\u2019t give up when we don't get all the way there.\u201d \u2013President Obama, BET Network interview airing tonight.Holder cracks down on \u2018racial profiling,\u2019 including for national security cases - WaPo: \u201cAttorney General Eric H.

            "article_content": "During manhunt, Vester Lee Flanagan leaves disturbing video of shooting and clues about his motives on Facebook and Twitter - one of his final statements to the world before shooting himself Angry employees like self-described \u201cpowder keg\u201d Vester Lee Flanagan, the onetime TV reporter who killed two former co-workers on live television Wednesday, are able to move from job to job because old bosses are too leery of legal action to talk when called for a reference, according to experts. The 41-year-old Flanagan\u2019s career was checkered with baseless complaints against co-workers, lawsuits alleging racism and incidents of bullying and belittling colleagues at WDBJ-7, in Roanoke, Va.. But as with many other problematic employees, his reputation did not always precede him as he built his resume. Employers who have rid themselves of a bad apple may see no benefit to sparing others of the same problem. \u201cEmployers are concerned about lawsuits,\u201d said Susan Heathfield, a human resources consultant. \u201cThere has been a trend in recent years for employers to adopt policies that state that all information shared about a former employee must come from HR, and many HR departments have also developed a policy that says they will not provide a prospective employer with any information except dates of employment, salary, and job titles.\u201d \u201cThis was someone with a serious mental disorder that went well beyond typical workplace anger.\u201d After landing the job in March, 2012, Flanagan, who reported under the name Bryce Williams, quickly developed a reputation for complaining about co-workers, being difficult to work with and displaying poor news judgment, said station manager Jeff Marks, who nonetheless defended his station's screening of new hires. \"By and large, we get really good employees here, but every now and then, one slips through the cracks,\" Marks said Thursday at a news conference. When it came time to fire Flanagan in February, 2013, the station's human resources officials called the police to oversee Flanagan\u2019s ouster, and co-workers hid in another room. The precautions proved well-founded, as Flanagan made a scene by issuing threats and refusing to leave peacefully. Former station manager Dan Dennison said later in a deposition for a racial discrimination case Flanagan filed that she scene left employees terrified. \u201cHe repeated his feeling that firing him would lead to negative consequences for me personally and for the station,\u201d Dennison said in the deposition for the case, which was dismissed. The incident was foreshadowed several years earlier, when Flanagan was fired at Tallahassee TV station WTWC in 2000. After a promising start, he quickly became a pain in the neck, recalled co-workers there. Don Shafer, Flanagan\u2019s former boss at WTWC, called Flanagan a \u201cpretty good reporter\u201d but said \u201cthings started getting a little strange with him.\u201d \u201cWe ended up having to terminate his contract and let him go for bizarre behavior and fighting with other employees,\u201d Shafer said on San Diego 6, where he now serves as news director. \u201cHe threatened to punch people out, and he was kind of running fairly roughshod over other people in the newsroom,\u201d Shafer added. When Flanagan left Tallahassee, he filed a discrimination suit which was settled out of court. That is the type of thing a former employer would be hesitant to warn a prospective one about, and Flanagan likely had only to show some footage of his best work and make a good impression in \u00a0his interview, said one expert. \u201cIndividuals with poor work histories may present well in a time limited interview,\u201d said Jude Miller Burke, author of \u201cThe Millionaire Mystique: How Working Women Become Wealthy and You Can Too!\u201d and a corporate consultant. \u201cAnd, often when a potential employer calls a past employer for a reference, the calls are not returned and people give up.\u201d Employers are legally permitted to answer questions honestly and completely when asked for a reference, but whatever they say must be documented in case litigation follows, said Heathfield. An employer may choose to communicate between the lines, answering \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in such a way that communicates their opinions without leaving a verbal trail. \u201cSmaller places might just shoot from the hip and tell the truth,\u201d said Seth Allcorn, a professor of professional practice at University of Missouri. \u201cBut they may have legal exposure if [the subject of the reference] finds out.\u201d In the lengthy manifesto Flanagan sent ABC News shortly after the killings, Flanagan called himself a \"powder keg\" and accused WDBJ-7 of sinking his chances to land a job at a station in Pennsylvania. He reportedly wrote that he was offered the job at the unidentified TV studio, but the offer was then rescinded. But the claim could not be verified, and experts said any number of red flags could have prompted a station to give Flanagan the cold shoulder. Once an employer unwittingly hires a volatile worker, supervisors face a minefield of delicate challenges, according to Allcorn, author of the 1994 book \u201cAnger in the Workplace.\u201d \u201cYou have to try to help them, and solve the problem in an incremental fashion,\u201d said Allcorn. \u201cBut if the person is running out of control, eventually he does become a security issue. At that point, you just say, \u201cWell, we gave it a run.\u201d Some six months before firing Flanagan, Dennison warned him in a memo that he \u201cmust make improvements immediately\u201d or \u201cface termination of employment.\u201d He was singled out for an inability to work well with colleagues and for wearing a President Obama sticker while reporting on the 2012 election. Dennison and WDBJ-7 appear to have done everything by the book with Flanagan, according to Allcorn. Given that he struck some two years after he was fired, there may have been little anyone could have done to protect themselves or their employees, Allcorn acknowledged. \u201cThis was someone with a serious mental disorder that went well beyond typical workplace anger,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Dinesh D'Souza discusses corruption in the Democratic Party and his new book and film 'Hillary's America' Editor's note: The following column is excerpted from Dinesh D'Souza's new book, \"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party\" (Regnery Publishing, July 18, 2016). Contrary to what we learn from progressives in education and the media, the history of the Democratic Party well into the twentieth century is a virtually uninterrupted history of thievery, corruption and bigotry.\u00a0 American history is the story of Democratic malefactors and Republican heroes.\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s true. I begin with Andrew Jackson. He\u2014not Thomas Jefferson or FDR\u2014is the true founder of the modern Democratic Party.\u00a0 Progressives today are divided about Jackson.\u00a0 Some, like historian Sean Wilentz, admire him, while others want to remove him from the $20 bill because he was a slaveowner and a vicious Indian fighter.\u00a0 He was, in this view, a very bad American. I support the debunking of Jackson, but not because he was a bad American\u2014rather, because he was a typical crooked Democrat.\u00a0 Jackson established the Democratic Party as the party of theft.\u00a0 He mastered the art of stealing land from the Indians and then selling it at giveaway prices to white settlers.\u00a0 Jackson\u2019s expectation was that those people would support him politically, as indeed they did.\u00a0 Jackson was indeed a \u201cman of the people,\u201d but his popularity was that of a gang leader who distributes his spoils in exchange for loyalty on the part of those who benefit from his crimes. Jackson also figured out how to benefit personally from his land-stealing.\u00a0 Like Hillary Clinton, he started out broke and then became one of the richest people in the country.\u00a0 How?\u00a0 Jackson and his partners and cronies made early bids on Indian land, sometimes even before the Indians had been evacuated from that land.\u00a0 They acquired the land for little or nothing and later sold it for a handsome profit.\u00a0 Remarkably, the roots of the Clinton Foundation can be found in the land-stealing policies of America\u2019s first Democratic president. The Democrats were also the party of slavery, and the slave-owning mentality continues to shape the policies of Democratic leaders today.\u00a0 The point isn\u2019t that the Democrats invented slavery which is an ancient institution that far predates America.\u00a0 Rather, Democrats like Senator John C. Calhoun invented a new justification for slavery, slavery as a \u201cpositive good.\u201d\u00a0 For the first time in history, Democrats insisted that slavery wasn\u2019t just beneficial for masters; they said it was also good for the slaves. Today progressive pundits attempt to conceal Democratic complicity in slavery by blaming slavery on the \u201cSouth.\u201d\u00a0 These people have spun a whole history that portrays the slavery battle as one between the anti-slavery North and the pro-slavery South.\u00a0 This of course benefits Democrats today, because today the Democratic Party\u2019s main strength is in the north and the Republican Party\u2019s main strength is in the South. But the slavery battle was not mainly a North-South issue.\u00a0 It was actually a battle between the pro-slavery Democrats and the anti-slavery Republicans.\u00a0 How can I make such an outrageous statement?\u00a0 Let\u2019s begin by recalling that northern Democrats like Stephen Douglas protected slavery, while most southerners didn\u2019t own slaves.\u00a0 (Three fourths of those who fought in the civil war on the confederate side had no slaves and weren\u2019t fighting to protect slavery.) Republicans, meanwhile, to one degree or another, all opposed slavery.\u00a0 The party itself was founded to stop slavery.\u00a0 Of course there were a range of views among Republicans, from abolitionists who sought immediately to end slavery to Republicans like Abraham Lincoln who recognized that this was both constitutionally and politically impossible and focused on arresting slavery\u2019s extension into the new territories.\u00a0 This was the main platform on which Lincoln won the 1860 election. The real clash was between the Democrats, north and south, who supported slavery and the Republicans across the country who opposed it.\u00a0 As Lincoln summarized it in his First Inaugural Address, one side believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, and the other believes it is wrong and ought to be restricted. \u201cThis,\u201d Lincoln said, \u201cis the only substantial dispute.\u201d \u00a0And this, ultimately, was what the Civil War was all about. In the end, of course, Republicans ended slavery and permanently outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment.\u00a0 Democrats responded by opposing the Amendment and a group of them assassinated the man they held responsible for emancipation, Abraham Lincoln.\u00a0 Republicans passed the Fourteenth Amendment securing for blacks equal rights under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment giving blacks the right to vote, over the Democrats\u2019 opposition. Confronted with these irrefutable facts, progressives act like the lawyer who is presented with the murder weapon belonging to his client.\u00a0 Darn, he says to himself, I better think fast.\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he now admits, \u201cmy client did murder the clerk and rob the store.\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t kill all those other people who were also found dead at the scene.\u201d In other words, progressives who are forced to acknowledge the Democratic Party\u2019s pro-slavery history promptly respond, \u201cWe admit to being the party of slavery, and we did uphold the institution for more than a century, but slavery ended in 1865, so all of this was such a long time ago.\u00a0 You can\u2019t blame us now for the antebellum wrongs of the Democratic Party.\u201d Yes, but what about the postbellum crimes of the Democratic Party? From Democratic support for slavery, let\u2019s turn to the party\u2019s complicity in segregation and the Ku Klux Klan.\u00a0 Democrats in the 1880s invented segregation and Jim Crow laws that lasted through the 1960s.\u00a0 Democrats also came up with the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d rationale that justified segregation and pretended that it was for the benefit of African Americans. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1866 in Pulaski, Tennessee by a group of former confederate soldiers; its first grand wizard was a confederate general who was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.\u00a0 The Klan soon spread beyond the South to the Midwest and the West and became, in the words of historian Eric Foner, \u201cthe domestic terrorist arm of the Democratic Party.\u201d The main point of the Klan\u2019s orgy of violence was to prevent blacks from voting\u2014voting, that is, for Republicans.\u00a0 Leading Democrats including at least one president, two Supreme Court justices, and innumerable Senators and Congressmen were Klan members.\u00a0 The last one, Robert Byrd, died in 2010 and was eulogized by President Obama and former President Bill Clinton. The sordid history of the Democratic Party in the early twentieth century is also married to the sordid history of the progressive movement during the same period.\u00a0 Progressives like Margaret Sanger\u2014founder of Planned Parenthood and a role model for Hillary Clinton\u2014supported such causes as eugenics and social Darwinism.\u00a0 While abortion was not an issue in Sanger\u2019s day, she backed forced sterilization for \u201cunfit\u201d people, notably minorities.\u00a0 Sanger\u2019s Negro Project was specifically focused on reducing the black population. Progressives also led the campaign to stop poor immigrants from coming to this country.\u00a0\u00a0 They championed laws in the 1920s that brought the massive flows of immigration to this country to a virtual halt.\u00a0 The motives of the progressives were openly racist and and in the way the immigration restrictions were framed, progressives succeeded in broadening the Democratic Party\u2019s target list of minority groups. While the Democratic Party previously singled out blacks and native Indians, progressives showed Democrats how to suppress all minorities.\u00a0 Included in the new list were Central and South American Hispanics as well as Eastern and Southern Europeans.\u00a0 Many of these people were clearly white but progressives did not consider white enough.\u00a0 Like blacks, they were considered \u201cunfit\u201d on the basis of their complexion. During the 1920s, progressives developed a fascination with and admiration for Italian and German fascism, and the fascists, for their part, praised American progressives.\u00a0 These were likeminded people who spoke the same language, and progressives and fascists worked together to implement programs to sterilize so-called mental defectives and \u201cunfit\u201d people, resulting subsequently in tens of thousands of forced sterilizations in America and hundreds of thousands in Nazi Germany. During the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent members of his brain trust to Europe to study fascist economic programs, which he considered more advanced that anything his New Deal had implemented to date.\u00a0 FDR was enamored with Mussolini, whom he called the \u201cadmirable Italian gentleman.\u201d\u00a0 Some Democrats even had a soft spot for Hitler: young JFK went to Germany before World War II and praised Hitler as a \u201clegend\u201d and blamed hostility to the Nazis as jealousy resulting from how much the Nazis had accomplished. Yes, I know. Very little of this is known by people today because progressives have done such a good job of sweeping it all under the rug.\u00a0 This material is simply left out of the textbooks even though it is right there in the historical record.\u00a0 Some progressive pundits know about it, but they don\u2019t want to talk about it. Indeed many progressives have been working hard to come up with lies that can be passed off as facts.\u00a0 Progressives have a whole cultural contingent\u2014Hollywood, the mainline media, the elite universities, even professional comedians\u2014to peddle their propaganda.\u00a0 From the television show Madame Secretary to the front page of the New York Times to nightly quips by Stephen Colbert, the progressive bilge comes at us continually and relentlessly. In this bogus narrative, Republicans are the bad guys because Republicans opposed the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\u00a0 For progressive Democrats, the civil rights movement is the canonical event of American history.\u00a0 It is even more important than the American Revolution.\u00a0 Progressive reasoning is: we did this, so it must be the greatest thing that was ever done in America.\u00a0 Republicans opposed it, which makes them the bad guys. The only problem is that Republicans were instrumental\u2014actually indispensable\u2014in getting the Civil Rights Laws passed.\u00a0 While Lyndon Johnson pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the backing of some northern Democrats, Republicans voted in far higher percentages for the bill than Democrats did.\u00a0 This was also true of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u00a0 Neither would have passed with just Democratic votes. Indeed, the main opposition to both bills came from Democrats. Interestingly enough the GOP is not merely the party of minority rights but also of women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 Republicans included women\u2019s suffrage in the party\u2019s platform as early as 1896. The first woman elected to Congress was Republican Jeanette Rankin in 1916.\u00a0 That year represented a major GOP push for suffrage, and after the GOP regained control of Congress, the Nineteenth Amendment granting women\u2019s suffrage was finally approved in 1919 and ratified by the states the following year. The inclusion of women in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was, oddly enough, the work of group of racist, chauvinist Democrats.\u00a0 Led by Democratic Congressman Howard Smith of Virginia, this group was looking to defeat the Civil Rights Act.\u00a0 Smith proposed to amend the legislation and add \u201csex\u201d to \u201crace\u201d as a category protected against discrimination. Smith\u2019s Democratic buddies roared with laughter when he offered his one-word amendment.\u00a0 They thought it would make the whole civil rights thing so ridiculous that no sane person would go along with it.\u00a0 One scholar noted that Smith\u2019s amendment \u201cstimulated several hours of humorous debate\u201d among racist, chauvinist Democrats.\u00a0 But to their amazement, the amended version of the bill passed. It bears repeating that Republicans provided the margin of victory that extended civil rights protection both to minorities and to women.

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream reports from Washington A doctor for a Planned Parenthood tissue harvesting partner appears to admit a baby\u2019s \u201cheart actually is still beating\u201d at times following abortions and an ex-procurement tech gives a first-person account of watching a baby\u2019s heart beat before she dissects its brain in the latest release from an anti-abortion group. The allegations are part of a new video from the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion activist group that has released a series of undercover and first-person interview videos focusing on Planned Parenthood and its partners. Wednesday\u2019s 11-minute, edited release features first-person interviews with Holly O\u2019Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress, a tissue harvesting company that worked with Planned Parenthood. It also features clips from previous CMP releases and new undercover audio and video. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Watch the new Planned Parenthood video. CMP has been the target of two restraining orders by federal judges \u2013 including one from StemExpress \u2013 banning them from releasing some of their recordings. But the Los Angeles Superior Court order only bars CMP from releasing video of three StemExpress officials taken at a restaurant in May. Wednesday\u2019s video does not appear to violate that limited order. \u201cSo you know there are times when after the procedure is done that the heart actually is still beating\u201d A recorded conversation heard during the new video features a voice identified as belonging to Dr. Ben Van Handel, the executive director of Novogenix Laboratories, LLC. Novogenix provides researchers with \u201chuman primary tissue-specific stem cells\u201d according to its website. \u201cSo you know there are times when after the procedure is done that the heart actually is still beating,\u201d Handel tells an undercover CMP investigator during the conversation. O\u2019Donnell, who has been featured in previous videos, describes a co-worker showing her a beating heart in an aborted baby. \u201c\u2018Hey Holly, come over here, I want you to see something kinda cool. It\u2019s kinda neat,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Donnell said the coworker told her. \u201cSo I\u2019m over here, and the moment I see it I\u2019m just flabbergasted. This is the most gestated fetus and the closest thing to a baby that I\u2019ve seen. And she\u2019s like, \u2018Okay I want to show you something.\u2019 And she has one of her instruments and she just taps the heart and it starts beating and I\u2019m sitting here and I\u2019m looking at this fetus and its heart is beating and I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d Following the demonstration, O\u2019Donnell said she and the co-worker cut the face of the baby open and dissected its brain. \u201cIt had a face,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t completely torn up. And its nose was very pronounced. It had eyelids. Its mouth was pronounced.\u201d In one of the most disturbing portions of the video, CMP shows a clip of a baby seeming to move its arms and legs post-abortion. The clip is from the Grantham Collection and Center for Bio-Ethical Reform and is not new undercover material. Previous videos have appeared to show Planned Parenthood officials admitting the organization alters abortion procedures to procure fetal tissue, delivers intact fetuses and sells fetal tissue for profit. Each of those practices is against federal law. A video last week featured O\u2019Donnell alleging that StemExpress sometimes did not obtain consent from mothers to use their fetal tissue, which would be a serious ethical breach if true. Planned Parenthood has denied breaking any laws and has said payments discussed in the videos relate to reimbursement costs for procuring the tissue \u2013 which is legal. \u201cThese extremists show a total lack of compassion and dignity for women\u2019s most personal medical decisions,\u201d an Aug. 4 statement from Planned Parenthood said. \u201cHuman Capital Episode 3: Planned Parenthood\u2019s Custom Abortions for Superior Product\u201d is the seventh release from CMP. The videos have brought investigations of Planned Parenthood's policies on aborted fetuses by three Republican-led congressional committees and three states. Investigators in Florida cited four Planned Parenthood clinics for violations earlier this month. The Senate failed to advance a Republican-led measure to halt federal aid to Planned Parenthood before its summer recess. But the issue of defunding Planned Parenthood has become a rallying cry for many groups on the right and is a top issue in the Republican primary battle. \"Exactly what is being done to obtain these intact bodies needs to be investigated,\" a statement released Wednesday from pro-life group Priests for Life said. \"Federal law prohibits abortion procedures that partially or fully deliver a living baby. Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell is serving life in prison because he aborted babies who were still alive when they came out of the mother\u2019s body. If Planned Parenthood is not fully investigated and prosecuted for these offenses, then we owe Gosnell an apology.\"",

(REUTERS/Mike Segar) Donald Trump is ranking higher than Hillary Clinton in Google searches on the eve of the U.S. election, as voters hunt for information on the Republican presidential nominee. Data released by Google show Trump dominating search in 38 states early afternoon Monday, including the battleground states of Florida and Michigan. Google data also show that immigration is the top Trump-related search topic, followed by abortion and race issues. \u201cIf you take a deeper look at the information, you\u2019ll see that the top five related searches to Mr. Trump are immigration, race, abortion, ISIS, and the economy - all hot button issues throughout this campaign,\u201d said social media expert and President of JRM Comm Jason Mollica, in an email to FoxNews.com. \u201cWhen it comes to Mr. Trump, people still want to know more. It also means that potential voters want to read what he said in the last 24-48 hours.\u201d SNAPPING A SELFIE WITH YOUR BALLOT COULD GET YOUR VOTE TOSSED OUT Mollica noted, however, that the search data from Google should not be seen as a surge of voting for Trump. \u201cIt does mean that people are actively gathering and reading information in the last hours before Election Day,\u201d he added. The hotly contested battle between Trump and Clinton is clearly generating huge interest in the U.S. electorate. Google has seen an incredible 233 percent increase in \u201chow to vote\u201d searches compared to the period before the 2012 presidential election. People are also actively searching for \u201cwhere to vote\u201d, particularly in battleground states. TRUMP, CLINTON, TIE IN GOOGLE DEBATE SEARCHES Additionally, Google has launched a new election Doodle that shows the letters holding signs with the word \u2018vote\u2019 in different languages. When users click on the Doodle and type in their address, Google generates information on their nearest polling station, along with voting requirements and ballot details. Twitter is also encouraging people to vote. The social media giant is promoting the #ElectionDay and #Election2016 hashtag and emoji, as well as providing information to voters via its @Gov Twitter Government account. Voters, for example, can direct message @Gov to find their polling place and ballot information. #ElectionDay is almost here! Remember: you cannot vote via text or Tweet. Direct Message @Gov to find your polling place and ballot info. pic.twitter.com/vS5YXN0uXp \u201c#ElectionFinalThoughts\u201d and \u201cTrump White House\u201d are top trending Twitter topics Monday. PENCE DOMINATED TWITTER DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE Facebook has a \u201cGet Ready for Election Day\u201d that lets voters preview their ballot and provides information on the candidates, from presidential through to the local level. Technology is being widely used to provide information for voters in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders supporter Tezlyn Figaro reacts to Hillary's support from Wall Street The political donation network backed by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch will essentially sit out this year's presidential election and focus on keeping the Senate in Republican hands. When Charles Koch addressed hundreds of the nation's most powerful polical donors at a weekend retreat in Colorado Springs Saturday, he lamented the choice in the race for the Oval Office between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. \"We don't really, in some cases, don't really have good options,\" Koch said in describing the \"current political situation.\" Mark Holden, general counsel and senior vice president of Koch Industries, told the Associated Press that the Koch network\u00a0won't spend anything to help Trump directly in 2016, even though it may evoke Clinton in attacks on Democratic congressional candidates. None of the presidential candidates are aligned with the Koch network \"from a values, and beliefs and policy perspective,\" Holden said, citing other determining factors such as \"running a good campaign\" and talking about key issues \"in a positive productive way.\" \"Based on that, we're focused on the Senate,\" Holden said, noting that the Koch network has devoted around $42 million so far to television and digital advertising to benefit Republican Senate candidates. Saturday was the first day of the three-day gathering for donors who promise to give at least $100,000 each year to the various groups backed by the Koch brothers' Freedom Partners -- a network of education, policy and political entities that aim to promote a smaller, less intrusive government. At least three governors, four senators and four members of the House of Representatives are also scheduled to attend, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Republican presidential candidates have been featured at past Koch gatherings -- but not this one. Neither Trump nor any Trump representatives participated in the event, even though the White House contender campaigned in the same city the day before. It's unclear if Trump was invited. \"I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch,\" Trump tweeted on Saturday. \"Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!\" Holden declined to say whether the Kochs sought a meeting with Trump. The weekend's agenda for the estimated 400 donors gathered in Colorado Springs featured a series of policy discussions and appearances from several elected officials in addition to Ryan: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas. Rep Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado. Speaking Saturday night, Gardner addressed the presidential contest indirectly, although he did not mention Trump's name. \"Forty years worth of Supreme Court justices are going to be determined this November,\" Gardner told donors, a reference to the next president's ability to fill at least one existing vacancy on the high court. Yet Koch later told his guests that America's frustrated electorate is looking at the wrong place -- politicians -- for answers. \"And to me, the answers they're getting are frightening,\" he said without naming any politicians, \"because by and large, these answers will make matters worse.\" Charles and David Koch have hosted such gatherings of donors and politicians for years, but usually in private. The weekend's event includes a small number of reporters, including one from the Associated Press. Koch has put the network's budget at roughly $750 million through the end of 2016. A significant portion was supposed to be directed at electing a Republican to the White House. It will instead go to helping Republican Senate candidates in at least five states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin and Florida, Holden said. In some cases, the network may try to link Democratic Senate candidates to Clinton, he added, but there are no plans to go after her exclusively in paid advertising. The organization may invest in a handful of races for governor and House of Representatives as well. And while the network will not be a Trump ally, it won't necessarily be a Trump adversary either. \"We have no intention to go after Donald Trump,\" Holden said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

MoveOn.org and Democracy for America said Tuesday they plan to suspend their Run Warren Run campaign on June 8. In their last act, they'll deliver a petition to Warren with more than 365,000 signatures urging her to run for president. The groups said they had already influenced the economic debate in 2016 and want to focus their efforts on working with Warren on issues such as trade, including defeating the effort to give President Obama so-called \"fast track\" authority to complete the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. \"Even without her in the race, Elizabeth Warren and the Run Warren Run campaign she inspired have already transformed the 2016 presidential election by focusing every single Democratic candidate on combating our country's income inequality crisis,\" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America. Some of Warren's followers may back Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination and has offered an economic agenda in line with Warren's views. Sanders, who formally launched his campaign last week, has called for a \"political revolution\" to elevate issues like income inequality, overhauling the campaign finance system and addressing climate change. Ilya Sheyman, MoveOn's executive director, said the campaign had helped elevate Warren's platform, \"an agenda that rejects the rigged status quo in Washington and puts working and middle-class Americans over corporate interests.\" The groups said they had held more than 400 events and recruited more than 60 state lawmakers and local party leaders from the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire to join their movement.",

The investigation ended Tuesday with FBI Director James Comey saying Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in using a private email-server system while secretary of state, but recommended no criminal charges, which led Attorney General Loretta Lynch to close the case. \"She made a mistake,\u201d Perez told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cAnd she acknowledges that she has to earn the trust back.\" Perez in part defended Clinton by pointing out that Comey testified last week on Capitol Hill that \u201ccareer officials\u201d had given her guidance on her email and server use. He also suggested that the GOP-controlled Congress will nevertheless continue to hold hearings on the issue. In addition, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is almost certain to continue to raise the issue in hopes of defeating Clinton in November. Perez also argued that Clinton had to win the trust of New York voters when she successfully ran in for a U.S. Senate seat, considering she had never run for office. \u201cThere were a lot of skeptics in New York,\u201d said Perez, who declined to discuss being a potential vice presidential pick. \u201cAnd she earned their trust, and then she got re-elected. \u2026 I\u2019ve seen Hillary Clinton up close and personal.

Events Continue to Intrude:\u00a0 Pressure cooker bombs in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, pipe bombs in northern New Jersey, and a knife wielding Somalia-American in Minnesota are powerful evidence the U.S. faces a rising threat of global Islamic terrorism. What does this mean politically? When terrorism intrudes more heavily into the campaign, it tends to help Donald Trump, who calls the threat by its name and promises tough action.\u00a0 Even before police confirmed that it was a bomb in New York and not an accident, Trump declared it was a bomb.\u00a0 He later tweeted, \u201cUnder the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook! ... Saturday's attacks show that failed Obama/Hillary Clinton polices [sic] won't keep us safe!\u201d Hillary Clinton may now be recognizing the political impact of terrorism on the campaign since she, too, issued a tough statement saying, \u201cI strongly condemn the apparent terrorist attacks\u201d and pledging \u201cwe will not rest\u201d until \u201cwe bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\u00a0 She called for the defeat of \u201cISIS and other terrorist groups\u201d and referred to her \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to do that, reminding Americans they \u201chave faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger.\u201d But Clinton later made a mistake by disputing Trump\u2019s claim that terror attacks in the U.S. are on a rise.\u00a0 Ordinary Americans are right to think the country is more at risk for Islamic-inspired and often directed attacks.\u00a0 This is another reason that when the issue is terrorism, many swing voters are inclined to think the answer is Trump. After a Few Good Weeks, Trump Falls Off The Wagon:\u00a0 When the Washington Post\u2019s Bob Costa asked Trump Wednesday if he thought President Obama was born in the United States, Trump answered, \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet.\u201d\u00a0 He also waved off a statement by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, that Trump now accepts that Obama was U.S. born, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s allowed to speak what she thinks.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s re-involvement in the birther movement put him squarely in the fever swamps, taking the short end of an issue where 80 percent of the American people think he\u2019s wrong. Trump tried to close Friday by saying \u201cPresident Obama was born in the United States, period.\u201d\u00a0 But he and his campaign then claimed the birther issue was first raised by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign with Conway pointing to a statement by Clinton\u2019s former manager that a volunteer in Iowa was spreading the issue eight years ago.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a big difference between the candidate and her campaign raising the issue and a volunteer doing it.\u00a0 Team Trump should avoid putting themselves in a place where every Trump supporter\u2019s actions and words could be laid at the feet of the candidate. Also on Friday, Trump discarded his script and extemporized at a Miami rally, suggesting Clinton\u2019s Secret Service detail should have their guns taken away and \u201cthen we will see what happens.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s never good for a candidate to sound like he expects violence. With the debate a week away and the election only 50 days off, Trump must remember the voters he needs are not like his hard core base, who might respond to red meat like that (though even many of them may winch, too).\u00a0 Swing voters desperately want change but worry Trump is too risky.\u00a0 His rhetorical flourish that she should have to face the campaign trail with unarmed Secret Service agents heightens the concerns of the voters Trump needs to win. Race Tightens More: In the last week, the RealClearPolitics average has tightened from 45.9% Clinton, 43.1 Trump last Monday \u2013 a 2.8% margin for Clinton \u2013 to 44.9 Clinton to 44% Trump, a 0.9% margin, this Monday. \u00a0The movement largely occurred because of events the week before last, when Clinton was under fire over her emails, special favors for Clinton Foundation donors, and keeping her diagnosis of pneumonia from the public. The race is probably a little wider than a point since the RealClearPolitics average includes the LA Times/USC Tracking Internet poll which has suspect methodology and gave Trump a seven-point lead.\u00a0 Even so, Trump has wiped out more than 80 percent of the lead Clinton enjoyed in early August. In the RealClearPolitics average of state polls, Trump now leads in Florida by 1%, Ohio by 1.2%, and Iowa by 4.3%.\u00a0 In late May, Trump was surprised when told he had a shot at Iowa.\u00a0 He\u2019s also ahead in Maine\u2019s Second District by 5.4% (Maine and Nebraska award Electoral votes by congressional district). In addition, Trump trails in North Carolina by only 0.8% and in Nevada by 0.7%.\u00a0\u00a0 The former was carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, the latter by Obama. But\u2026: Trump still has a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.\u00a0 If he carries North Carolina and the rest of the Romney states PLUS Florida, Ohio and Iowa, he\u2019s at 259 Electoral votes.\u00a0 If he takes Nevada, he\u2019s at 265. But then he must win Pennsylvania or Michigan or Virginia, which would give him 285, 282 or 278 respectively.\u00a0 Today, the RealClearPolitics average has him behind in the Keystone State by 6.6%, in Michigan by 5.2%, and in Virginia by 3.5%.\u00a0 While these margins are smaller than they were at this time last month, the race has not closed as much in these three battlegrounds as it has nationally. If he loses all three states, then his last option might be to win the four Electoral votes of New Hampshire (where he trails by 5%) plus the one Electoral vote from Maine\u2019s Second District.\u00a0 The would move him from 265 to 270, unless Clinton snakes away the Electoral vote from Nebraska\u2019s Second District that President Obama won in 2012.\u00a0 If that happened, then it would be Clinton 271 to Trump 269. Imagine \u2013 the presidential election could come down to how the residents of Bangor, Maine and Omaha, Nebraska vote.\u00a0 What a year.",

            "article_content": "Republican nominee delivers immigration policy speech in Arizona Donald Trump, fresh off a hastily arranged visit to Mexico where he met with the country's president, doubled down Wednesday night on his vow to build a \"great wall\" along the southern border -- and make Mexico pay for it -- while outlining a more focused mission for the deportation force he's promised to create. In a speech in Phoenix meant to clarify his immigration positions after appearing to soften his stance, the Republican presidential nominee outlined a hardline set of proposals for tackling illegal immigration. He did not, however, definitively call for removing all illegal immigrants in the country. Rather, Trump vowed to focus first on deporting the estimated 2 million \"criminal aliens\" on day one, while also prioritizing certain groups like gang members and visa overstays for removal. He said, though, that any illegal immigrant could be subject to deportation under his administration. \"There will be no amnesty,\" he said, adding that no illegal immigrant would be legalized without first leaving and coming in through the front door. \"For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal\u00a0status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply\u00a0for reentry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration\u00a0system I outlined above,\" he said. Trump said that America\u2019s current immigration system \u201cserves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians.\" \u201cLet me tell you who it does not serve, it does not serve you the American people. It doesn\u2019t serve you,\u201d he said. In his speech, Trump also promised to end \"catch and release,\" to increase the number of ICE and border patrol agents, block funding for sanctuary cities, and create a deportation task force that he said would be focused on deporting criminal aliens. He also promised to cancel President Obama's \"illegal\" executive actions, and to enforce current immigration laws and accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of not having a plan on immigration, saying she would give \"ObamaCare, Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\" When he talked about deporting criminal aliens who had \"evaded justice,\" he also said Clinton had evaded justice. \"Maybe they'll be able to deport her too,\" he quipped. He told the crowd that there are some immigrants who will be unable to assimilate into American society. \u201cIt\u2019s our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us,\u201d he said. Amid rumors he was considering softening his trademark position on building a wall on the southern border, Trump made his position very clear. \"We will build a great wall along the southern border,\" he said to cries of \"build the wall\" from the boisterous crowd. \"And Mexico will pay for the wall.\" He later said the wall would be \"impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful.\" Trump\u2019s speech comes after he met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto earlier in the day and asserted America\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to build a border wall during a hastily arranged visit to Mexico City. While both leaders adopted a measured and respectful tone, with Trump calling it a \"substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas,\" there was disagreement on the question of the wall. While Trump told reporters \u201cwe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall,\u201d Pena Nieto later contradicted Trump and said the subject was among those discussed. He also tweeted that he made it clear \"that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" Trump has been accused of stoking tensions on the subject ever since he announced his campaign in June of last year in which he accused Mexico of not sending their best people across the border. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\u201d he said. In recent weeks, Trump has been accused of softening his tone on the subject, and had been forced to clarify whether he favored a path to citizenship for those here legally, and whether he still planned to build a wall. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "State Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Calif., at his alma mater, the University of Southern California. Lara is author of the SB 1146 bill. This week the California Assembly begins final deliberations on Sen. Ricardo Lara\u2019s \u201cEquity in Higher Education Act\u201d (SB 1146). The bill, which passed the Senate in late May, has a salutary purpose -- to ensure against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation at California campuses. Unfortunately, this legislation goes far beyond that. As it is written today, SB 1146 would violate the religious freedom of faith-based colleges and could jeopardize higher educational opportunities for the tens of thousands of Californians they serve, including many who are black, Latino, Asian and low-income. Here is the problem, as we see it: Current California law exempts religious schools from nondiscrimination laws in cases where applying these laws \u201cwould not be consistent with the religious tenets of that organization.\u201d This is sensible and reflects our nation\u2019s founding principles of religious freedom. For years now, this policy has worked well, enabling church-run colleges and universities to hire personnel and establish policies and expectations regarding religious practice and personal conduct that reflect their beliefs and values. SB 1146 proposes to drastically narrow that historic exemption so that it would only protect seminaries or other schools that train clergy and ministers. Any other faith-based school that receives state monies or enrolls students who depend on the Cal Grants financial aid program would be forced to change their policies to accommodate practices that in some cases would be contrary to their beliefs and teachings. Detailed provisions in the legislation include rules for bathroom use and sleeping arrangements in dormitories. The bill even has the government setting guidelines for what \u201creligious practices\u201d and \u201crules for moral conduct\u201d will be acceptable on these campuses. If passed as written today, this bill would force faith-based institutions to choose between compromising their deeply held beliefs and risking an endless wave of costly litigation to defend themselves. This is a choice that no individual or institution should face in our state or in our country. In fact, the First Amendment and Bill of Rights were enacted to prevent precisely the kind of government interference reflected by SB 1146. Title IX of federal law also respects the rights of faith-based colleges and universities to operate free from government meddling. But those who would truly be punished by this bill are California\u2019s low-income and minority families -- including millions served by our respective faith communities here in Los Angeles. Historically, faith-based institutions have been a refuge for blacks, Asians and other minorities seeking a college education in the face of economic hardship and racial discrimination. That was true in the days before the Civil Rights Act and it is still true today. Christian and other private nonprofit colleges in California serve a diverse student body -- nearly 60 percent are minorities and nearly 90 percent need financial aid. Many of the schools that would be affected by this legislation participate in the federal government\u2019s Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HIS) initiative to expand Latino access to higher education -- schools such as California Lutheran, Azuza Pacific, Fresno Pacific, Notre Dame de Namur, among others. To qualify for HIS status means these schools have student populations that are at least 25 percent Hispanic. Many of these students are children of immigrants and the first in their families to attend college. We question why lawmakers would want to make it harder for Latinos and other minorities to receive an education by potentially denying their schools the opportunity to redeem Cal Grants. This is not fair to those students and it contradicts the state\u2019s noble tradition of seeking to expand educational and economic opportunities for all Californians. And all of this is unnecessary to achieve the goals of protecting the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender students. The simple solution is to require that faith-based schools clearly state -- on their websites and in written materials -- what they believe, what accommodations they intend to provide to students, and what will be expected of students in terms of religious practice and personal conduct. Most faith-based colleges and universities already do this. Sen. Lara\u2019s bill proposes some helpful requirements that would further strengthen transparency and public disclosure at these institutions. But his legislation should stop there. It is important to remember that no one is compelled to attend a private religious college or university. Those who do so make a deliberate decision because they are seeking an academic environment and community where they can live, learn and serve with others who share their beliefs, values and aspirations. We respectfully urge lawmakers to amend SB 1146 so that California continues to protect the freedom and integrity of faith-based higher education and continues to afford poor and minority students the freedom to attend the college or university of their choice, regardless of their religious beliefs.

The email, from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office chief and part of a chain of correspondence within the agency, urges the unnamed recipient to swear in as many citizens as possible \u201cdue to the election year.\u201d \u201cThe Field Office due to the election year needs to process as many of their N-400 cases as possible between now and FY 2016,\u201d reads the email, which was disclosed to FoxNews.com by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \u201cIf you have cases in this category or other pending, you are encouraged to take advantage of the OT if you can,\u201d the email continues. \u201cThis will be an opportunity to move your pending naturalization cases. If you have not volunteered for OT, please consider and let me know if you are interested.\u201d Parts of the email were redacted before it was disclosed to FoxNews.com, but it was sent by the branch chief of the Houston Field Office District 17. It was not clear to whom it was addressed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better!\u201d reads the July 21 note introducing the forwarded missive. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the year crunch time, so let\u2019s get crunchy! Go Team Houston! Thanks for all your hard work!\u201d Johnson and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, in a Wednesday letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, said it appears the agency is trying to swear in new citizens as the election between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and GOP choice Donald Trump approaches. \u201cYour department seems intent on approving as many naturalization cases as quickly as possible at a time when it should instead be putting on the brakes and reviewing past adjudications,\u201d the senator\u2019s letter read. Johnson referred to a report this week from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General that found at least 858 people from terror hotspots and other countries of concern had been mistakenly granted citizenship despite facing orders of deportation under other identities. \"Considering that USCIS already has a troubling record of inadequate review of naturalization applications, and mistakenly giving away citizenship to terrorists, criminals and other fraudsters, it is disturbing that they are now in full and blind rubber stamp mode to crank out new citizens,\" said\u00a0Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. In a USCIS planning document submitted to Congress earlier this year, USCIS reported it expected to receive 828,000 total applications this year, up from a planned 815,000 last year, an increase of 13,000, Vaughan said. A USCIS official, though, said the processing push has to do with managing applications in a timely manner -- and officials are merely trying to deal with the surge in applications typical in election years. \"USCIS\u2019s goal is to process applications for naturalization within five to seven months, regardless of external events such as elections,\" the official said. \"USCIS anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, as we usually see in an election year, but the increase in N-400 applications has exceeded expectations. USCIS has detailed staff to offices experiencing increased workloads and has authorized overtime for many offices.\" The official added: \"USCIS certainly encourages our naturalized citizens to be active participants in our democracy. However, like other citizens, no new U.S. citizen is required to register to vote, or participate in any election. The issue at hand is our desire to ensure naturalization applications are processed within our normal times.\" The effort is reminiscent of a similar bid to bring in new voters when Bill Clinton ran for re-election in 1996, said Claude\u00a0Arnold, a retired U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations. \"I am not at all surprised by this revelation,\" Arnold said. \"This is a repeat of the Clinton election playbook. Then it was to help re-elect Bill Clinton, this time it is to help elect Hillary Clinton.\" The all-out push shows the Obama administration is using levers to help Clinton win, said Dan Stein, president of Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"In the pursuit of a partisan advantage, one party has decided integrity in the system is irrelevant,\" Stein said. \"They don\u2019t really care about checking backgrounds or verifying status and eligibility \u2013 it is more about increasing the number of eligible voters in the upcoming election.\"",

            "article_content": "Bradley Blakeman and Emily Tisch Sussman on possible candidates running for her seat California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, a tenacious liberal whose election to the Senate in 1992 heralded a new era for women at the upper reaches of political power, announced Thursday she will not seek re-election to a new term next year. Boxer's retirement sets off a free-for-all among a new generation of California Democrats, who have been ascendant in the state for years with few offices to aspire to while Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have held a lock on the state's U.S. Senate seats. A staunch supporter of abortion rights, gun control and environmental protections, Boxer has said she is most proud of the vote that she cast against the war in Iraq. The 74-year-old Boxer made the announcement in an unusual video in which she answered questions posed by her grandson, Zach Rodham. \"I am never going to retire. The work is too important. But I will not be running for the Senate in 2016,\" Boxer said. In the video, Boxer's grandson is a surrogate reporter posing questions to her. Rodham is the son of Nicole Boxer and Tony Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's youngest brother. \"I want to help our Democratic candidate for president make history,\" Boxer tells her grandson, a clear reference to a possible bid by Clinton. She closed with a poem. \"So although I won't be working in my Senate space and I won't be running in that next tough race, as long as there are issues and challenges and strife, I will never retire, because that's the meaning of my life.\" Boxer was first elected to the House in 1982 and to the Senate one decade later. It was an election that marked a watershed year for women in politics, with four winning U.S. Senate seats. Boxer prominently displays in her office a photograph of her and six other female members of the House marching up the steps leading to the Senate, where they demanded that senators hold hearings on Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas before holding his confirmation vote. Boxer's departure is a generational change as well. Boxer's fellow California senator, Feinstein, is 81, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is 74. \"I always knew I had a partner in Barbara,\" Feinstein said. \"She is never one to shy away from any challenge, and I can't thank her enough for being such a resilient collaborator.\" The news surprised Pelosi, who said at a Capitol Hill news conference she was unaware of Boxer's decision. Pelosi said the senator called earlier but that she missed the call. \"I thought she wanted to have dinner,\" Pelosi said. She described Boxer, who stands 4 feet, 11 inches tall, as \"small in size but a giant in terms of contributions to her country.\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama called Boxer to congratulate her on her retirement and her service. Boxer had a way of riling conservatives. She can be abrupt with those who question or disagree with her, and she cemented her reputation as a firebrand with testy exchanges with witnesses at committee hearings over the years. In 2009, she requested that a brigadier general in the Army Corps of Engineers call her senator instead of ma'am. The confrontation served as fundraising fodder for her election opponents the following year, but she still won handily. And during the height of the war in Iraq, she challenged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's integrity by telling her that she believed her \"loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell this war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.\" In her campaign ads, Boxer would constantly hammer home her feistiness and play on her last name by describing herself as a fighter. Boxer would have been a prohibitive favorite to win if she had sought re-election in strongly Democratic California. Republicans have found it exceedingly difficult to find a candidate who can compete statewide. Even before she announced her retirement, there was a great deal of speculation about possible Democratic candidates to succeed her. Among them: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor; state Attorney General Kamala Harris; former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; and Tom Steyer, a retired San Francisco hedge fund billionaire who sought to make climate change an issue in the midterm elections. While lauding Boxer in prepared statements, none of the potential candidates indicated he or she would attempt to succeed her. Statewide elections in California are hugely expensive and could require Republicans to side with a candidate who would significantly fund his or her own campaign, such as Rep. Darrell Issa or business executive Carly Fiorina, who lost to Boxer in her last race and is weighing a run for president. Another possible candidate is Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin, who waged a competitive race for state controller last year. Republicans view the retirement as positive for the 2016 elections in part because it could mean that Democrats will have to spend money to retain the seat, which they probably would not have done if Boxer were in the race. Still, the latest voter registration numbers in California show that Republicans will have an extremely difficult time, particularly during a presidential election when there's larger Democratic turnout. The latest voter registration statistics show that only about 28 percent of the state's voters are registered as Republicans. \"A California Republican starts every statewide race 15 points behind and is competing against arguably the most effective state political party in the country,\" said Republican strategist Aaron McLear, who also described the state as \"nearly impossible for Republicans to win statewide.\" Boxer narrowly won her first Senate race after a late revelation that her Republican opponent had attended a strip club. She won her three subsequent Senate races by double-digit margins. Her job performance ratings over the years have consistently been more positive than negative, though they tend to lag behind ratings for Feinstein, who is viewed as more of a centrist and someone relied on by business groups in the state to get something through Congress. Political observers say Boxer's work to protect the environment is probably her most significant legacy. Boxer authored legislation that has designated more than 1 million acres of land in California as wilderness, a classification that is the highest level of protection and generally does not allow for motor vehicles, new roads and mining. She also led efforts to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. However, she has failed to help pass meaningful legislation to curb global warming, a longtime goal that became even more distant when Republicans won control of the Senate and Boxer lost her prized role as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. \"I think she would say she's been a soldier in an ongoing fight that has yet to conclude,\" said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California.

            "article_content": "This split shows Hillary Clinton, left, and Donald Trump, right. (AP) If you're reading this, you've survived the 2016 presidential race \u2013 through all its heart-stopping twists and turns. As the vote gets underway Tuesday, FoxNews.com looks\u00a0back on the memorable moments that have made this the most unusual, unpredictable White House battle in modern American history. Hillary Clinton email scandal erupts The first campaign bombshell came in March 2015, when the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that Hillary Clinton -- then, not even an announced candidate -- had exclusively used a private email server, located at her New York home, when serving as secretary of state. The bombshell sent shockwaves through the media, Congress and the country at large, and the issue would dog Clinton throughout both the primaries and general election cycle. Shortly before the party convention, FBI Director James Comey in early July\u00a0announced\u00a0that while Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in the handling of classified information, the agency did not recommend charges. That seemed to be the end of it, but there was still one more twist to the tale ... Donald Trump announces his candidacy It all began with a slow escalator ride at Trump Tower. On June 26, 2015, the billionaire announced his longshot anti-establishment candidacy with a searing speech remembered most famously for his so-called \u201cMexican rapist\u201d line \u2013 in which he accused Mexico of sending bad people across the border. \u201cThey're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\u201d he said, in remarks that would kick off his unconventional campaign. Most analysts gave Trump little chance of winning the nomination, believing he would be crushed underfoot by the likes of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. But the Trump Train proved much sturdier than many imagined. Sparks fly at GOP primary debates as Democrats bury theirs The primary debates, particularly on the Republican side, were some of the most fiery in recent history \u2013 with unusual two-tier debates being set up due to the number of candidates in the race. At the debates themselves, all eyes were on Trump, and he didn't disappoint. Sparks flew as Trump beat up on \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb, took shots at Rosie O\u2019Donnell and fought back against claims he had small hands by making a reference to his genitals -- and even boycotted one of the debates in order to hold his own veterans fundraiser. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, wounded his own candidacy by repeating the same talking point three times at one debate. On the Democratic side, there seemed to be very little interest in holding debates, as the DNC scheduled several on weekends and around the same time as top NFL games. Bernie Sanders surges When self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in April 2015, few gave him much of a chance against the Clinton campaign behemoth. But as the other rivals \u2013 former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb \u2013 fell by the wayside, Bernie remained and picked up momentum as young people in particular started to \u201cFeel The Bern.\u201d Despite winning states such as Michigan, Colorado and New Hampshire and hitting Clinton hard on issues like her speeches to Goldman Sachs, he was eventually defeated, but on the way inspired a movement of young people, and gave the former secretary of state somewhat of a scare. Debbie Wasserman Schultz steps down On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, then-Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to announce she would step down after emails released by WikiLeaks appeared to show discussions by DNC staff to help Clinton at the expense of her primary rivals. The scandal infuriated Sanders supporters, gave red meat to Trump's claim that the process was \"rigged\" and threatened to undercut the DNC\u2019s show of unity at their convention. Quickly, Wasserman Schultz was replaced by interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, who herself would come under fire after emails showed her appearing to leak primary debate questions to the Clinton campaign. Cruz stuns GOP convention audience Trump\u2019s main primary rival Ted Cruz shocked the Republican National Convention by refusing to endorse the nominee in his speech in Cleveland, telling voters to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d in November, to boos from delegates. Cruz would later go on to endorse Trump, much to the dismay of many of Cruz\u2019s supporters who had previously applauded his stance at the convention. Clinton stumbles, is dragged into a van on 9/11 Rumbling questions over Hillary Clinton\u2019s health erupted on Sept. 11 when Clinton was forced to leave a 9/11 remembrance service early after reportedly feeling ill. Video emerged of Clinton stumbling and being carried by aides into a black van, fueling the rumors about Clinton\u2019s fitness for office. The campaign later revealed the former secretary of state was suffering from pneumonia, as Clinton also suffered in the polls in the days after the health scare. Leak of Trump tax records Trump has continually come under fire for refusing to release his tax returns. In October, an unnamed source took the liberty of mailing Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records to a New York Times reporter. The records showed that the billionaire declared a $916 million loss -- so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. The release only increased the calls for Trump to release his tax returns \u2013 yet Trump still refused to play ball, saying he couldn\u2019t release them as he is being audited. 2005 tape reveals Trump's sexual remarks In October, a 2005 tape of Trump making sexually crude comments on an \"Access Hollywood\" shoot was leaked to The Washington Post, raising again questions about Trump\u2019s language toward women. The video captured Trump on a hot mic talking to Billy Bush on a bus about groping and kissing women, saying \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it ... You can do anything.\u201d The tape forced Trump into a rare apology, and damaged his standing in the polls. It also led to a number of women coming forward to accuse the billionaire of having sexually assaulted or harassed them in the past. He denied it. WikiLeaks dumps thousands of Podesta emails In the second big phase of their leaks, WikiLeaks in October began an almost daily leak of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails. The emails led to a constant drip drip of negative stories about the campaign, and gave raw insight into the internal goings-on of the campaign. Stories included the leaking of questions to the Clinton campaign by Donna Brazile, negative remarks about Catholics by Clinton staffers, criticism of Clinton by key allies, and\u00a0coordination with the State Department. Trump says he may not accept the election results In the final presidential debate, Trump raised eyebrows once again by saying he would not necessarily accept the results of the general election. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense,\u201d Trump said when asked by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace. He later clarified that he was reserving his right to challenge a \u201cquestionable result.\u201d He also teased the media by promising an announcement the day after the debate, then saying he\u00a0would\u00a0accept the results,\u00a0before clarifying, \u201cIf I win,\u201d to the delight of his supporters in Delaware, Ohio. Clinton email scandal 2.0 The 2016 October surprise came at the very end of the month, when FBI Director James Comey announced in October that the bureau was revisiting the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she served as secretary of state. The decision came after the FBI found new emails on the computer of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner \u2013 the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. #DonaldTrump announces #FBI reopening its investigation into #HillaryClinton's private email server as his supporters chant, \"Lock her up!\" pic.twitter.com/rgmDbn2xrI The announcement put Clinton\u2019s lead in doubt and energized the Trump campaign, yet two days before the election Comey announced that the new review of the emails hadn't changed the agency's July opinion.",

            "article_content": "Kennedy shares her thoughts in a new opinion piece Much has been made of Donald Trump\u2019s pro-wrestling past (as far as I know the WWE Hall of Famer never donned a singlet for money, but he did host a few WWE events at his casino) but it\u2019s easy to see how this entire presidential circus is, in itself, a pro-wrestling bonanza. Never has a race so fixated on villains, trickery, gags and drama. The very food of the world\u2019s favorite scripted sport is a buffet in this election. Conservatives who decried Trump\u2019s rise (and those who scoffed at his chances of winning a single primary were legion) are the same \u201cpurist\u201d boxing snobs who could never grasp the popularity -- and populist legitimacy -- of wrestling. The Rock will enjoy more money and infamy than Joe Frazier thanks to his lucrative mainstream movie career via the WWE, and Donald Trump will become the Republican nominee with a similar combination of staging, emotional taunts, ongoing (and outlandish) narratives, and tools of pick-up artistry on Cialis. That\u2019s all obvious, but it only tells part of the sweaty, amplified story\u2026 What makes wrestling successful? Is it the same magic that Trump used to pull everyone in the ring -- and pull them all down -- with him? WWE star, Dolph Ziggler. (AP) For that I must turn to an actual professional wrestler, a WWE star who\u2019s spent the better part of a decade in silver lam\u00e9 shorts grinding his hips in America\u2019s face as the infamous\u00a0rebellious ladykiller Dolph Ziggler. He also happens to be a political junkie and avid Fox News watcher who regularly comments via social media on the collision of these two worlds. Here\u2019s his take from a phone and email conversation I had with him recently: The road to WrestleMania is like an election year. The Royal Rumble usually has 30 people in it, which narrows down to 4 and then finally two. Only one of them can go on to the main event. From your perspective, how is this race like pro wrestling? The great stories in this election are what make it like WWE and what make WWE a global phenomenon. There are so many characters that everyone can relate to. It\u2019s not like 20, 30, 40 years ago and it was us vs. Russia, like the Cold War with good vs. evil, now everyone can relate to someone, there are so many shades of grey. Little kids who get picked on and bullied can relate to the Lucha Dragons who are smaller, but they\u2019re quick and exciting and never give up. Someone fed up with their boss can relate to Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose or myself. Roman Reigns (FNC/AP) In the same way, someone who would normally see typical politicians now has Donald Trump who relates to normal people or wrestling fans. Dean Ambrose (AP) In the beginning when he was a new, non-establishment candidate, wrestlers and friends and people not even interested in politics took notice of this outsider. As the election moved on, as he became the frontrunner, his own party seemed to continually pull the rug out from under him. That happens to people at work all the time when they\u2019re passed over for a promotion, and it happens to wrestlers in story lines with \u201cThe Authority\u201d -- that\u2019s Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. They are the boss of the show. They constantly reiterate they know \u201cwhat\u2019s best for business,\u201d they\u2019re the antagonists who want a champion who fits the proper mold and will carry out their will, ensuring success for WWE. Paul Levesque aka Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are seen at the WWE Hall of Fame Induction at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. (Jonathan Bachman/AP) Much like the often villainously portrayed GOP, they think they know what\u2019s best for business, better than the American people and for the most part come out on top by justifying their involvement for the greater good. Bernie Sanders is comparable to Daniel Bryan of a year ago, once again another outsider gaining momentum where it seemed an apparent heir to the throne was already decided, which would be like Hillary. (FNC/Jonathan Bachman / AP Images for WWE) How do the characters and storylines in politics mirror what you do? Most politicians, until this election, were for the most part boring insiders no one could really relate to. But now, much like in politics and WWE, there are so many different types of characters. Whether they\u2019re underdogs, body builders or renaissance men, you can somehow get behind your favorite no matter the situation. Who is the Donald Trump of the WWE? I mean, it\u2019s obviously The New Day. They have been around in different and entertaining ways over the years, with ups and downs, and now the perfect storm has come together. Timing is everything! The world is ready for something new and fresh, and they are on fire. They say what they want, the have knee-jerk reactions to topical events (like the Steph Curry 2 Mall Walkers) and The New Day has caught fire. They used to get on people\u2019s nerves, but now crowds cheer for them. They have vowed to make WWE great again, and they stand for a new era of sports entertainment. They are all about positivity, and whichever side you are on you\u2019ll tune in to see them do their thing. The New Day (WWE) The Donald is the unicorn of modern politics, and The New Day wear unicorn horns on their heads. They also have outlandish hairstyles that defy gravity and logic, and Donald\u2026well, I guess that\u2019s where the similarities end. Are there any other Trumps lurking in the shadows? Brock Lesnar makes his entrance at Wrestlemania XXXI in Santa Clara, Calif. (AP Photo/Don Feria) You could also say the other Trump of WWE is Brock Lesnar. He is an imposing entity who says whatever he wants, comes and goes as he pleases, dominates his opponents and is without a doubt, a beast of a draw in wrestling and MMA. Like The Donald, he is a ratings juggernaut and he won UFC 200 that Vegas odds-makers said he would lose, while receiving the biggest payday in their history. They said Trump would lose before he became the presumptive nominee, but will he get the biggest job in history? Where Trump sees himself as a uniter, Brock considers himself a lone wolf.\u00a0 He still manages to bring people together by saying things like this after his win at UFC 200: \"Shoutout to the men in uniform, that protect and serve this country. From sea to shining sea. From one whiteboy, to all nationalities; we've got to stand together, people.\" WWE star, John Cena. (Jonathan Bachman/Associated Press Images) It appears that the Donald and the Beast Incarnate have a lot in common, especially since opponents see Trump as another type of beast. Who\u2019s Hillary in this equation? John Cena is the face of our company, the obvious front runner. Even though several different Bernies have attempted to overthrow the Hillary, after all the arguing and stunts, Hillary is still the nominee just like Cena is still the face of WWE. Was he at least indicted? Sen. Rand Paul (AP) Hahaha\u2026theoretically he was. For the longest time Cena would be, and still is, filibustered by half the WWE universe. Fans regularly hijack his matches with chants of either \u201cLet\u2019s go Cena!\u201d or \u201cCena sucks!\u201d Regardless of what they chant, WWE FANS makes their voices heard. The problem is when no one cares enough to chant, that\u2019s not happening anytime soon. Cena doesn\u2019t always come out on top, but he does have a 50 percent approval rating from his delegates in the arena. He\u2019s the undeniable face of the WWE Party. Who are you in all of this? I guess the closest comparison would be Rand Paul. I want to change the game and break through the nonsense without any Establishment help. I got seated at the end of the stage, barely hanging on to that gilded circle, and was even asked \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d by the frontrunner. What happened? Who did you insult? (FNC/AP) After repeatedly being a thorn in The Authority\u2019s side, burning them every chance I got and overcoming odds, eventually they won out and crushed my spirit. Who\u2019s Marco Rubio? Tenacious, one time front runner, able to raise money, couldn\u2019t quite seal the deal\u2026 Charlotte and Sasha are the young, hip Rubio-esque representatives of the New Era. They are extremely capable and great at what they do. They\u2019re dominant in Florida and have plenty of time to take over the world. Now if only they could win that Senate seat again! With Bernie, who hung onto the race waaaay too long, and a libertarian nominee on the rise, is this a royal rumble? What\u2019s the best scenario to compare the crowded field to a WWE staple with multiple players? It\u2019s very comparable to a Royal Rumble. In WWE there are always several possible candidates to headline WrestleMania but there can only be two. You always have an outsider, an insider, a wildcard and a number of up and comers, but it always comes down to roughly 4 for the Rumble. Theoretically the road to WrestleMania is like an election year. The Royal Rumble usually has 30 people in it, which narrows down to 4 and then finally two. Only one of them can go on to the main event. On the Republican side it was much more of a free-for-all with several different front runners, and just like in WWE anything can happen. Seven or eight months ago we thought Jeb Bush was going to go head-to-head with Donald Trump. It goes to show with the audience and voters how quickly things can change. You never know who the finalists or nominees will be, much like a good Royal Rumble. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are competing for the same title in different years. Is there a rivalry that compares? The closest comparison between WWE and politics would be the end of the Attitude Era (1999 or so) and the beginning of the New Era (2016). The Establishment and everything it stands for is embodied in Ryan, even though he is the younger candidate. Trump\u2019s rise to power is because he is a New Era candidate. Social media is a YUUUGE factor. This era/election is all about non-establishment candidates, not fitting the mold, and being self-made. Trump says whatever he feels, even if it flies in the face of WWE or the free world, and win or lose, love him or hate him, you are watching and will continue to tune in. Whether you are entertained or not, be sure to complain about it online like a real American (wrestling fan) would! If this were WrestleMania, how would it end? It could end sending everyone home happy with an entirely new lease on life and a new champion is crowned, and you look forward to the upcoming year. OR it ends in controversy and you can\u2019t wait to tune in to see how they're going to top it. We\u2019ll have to wait a few more days to see how things shake out in Cleveland and Philadelphia, but it\u2019s obvious presidential politics will continue to mimic pro-wrestling in an historic year filled with pageantry, rivalries and the strangest race in history. We\u2019ll all be pinned to our TVs in disbelief trying to figure out who gets the belt and how this madness finally ends.",

            "article_content": "Pollsters weigh in **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0 Don\u2019t kid yourself, the polls are usually right - Grassley: Release material from Clinton probe - Ed Rendell says Clinton Foundation should be shut down if Hillary wins - Audible: The Lady\u2019s not for turning - Worst Swedish fish everDON\u2019T KID YOURSELF, THE POLLS ARE USUALLY RIGHT If Donald Trump and his campaign really don\u2019t believe that he is behind in the presidential election, then they are much worse off than even the polls would indicate. The magic meme moment for this phase of the campaign came Thursday in a CNN interview where a Trump adviser face planted when he tried to game the polls. Informed that his campaign was losing, Trump lawyer Michael Cohen retorted, \u201cSays who?\u201d When told that it was the verdict of the polls, Cohen sneered, \u201cWhich polls?\u201d The answer that has been ricocheting around the media: \u201cAll of them.\u201d And they all really do. Certainly, Trump\u2019s new campaign manager, pollster Kellyanne Conway, knows the truth. So, one would assume that others in the campaign are aware of Trump\u2019s deficit, which currently stands at about 9 points in an average of reliable polls. If the numbers hold, it would be the worst popular vote defeat since 1984, so whatever individual polls indicate, there is lots of ground to be made up. The candidate this morning tweeted, \u201cThey will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!\u201d an apparent reference to the botched polling of the U.K. referendum on leaving the European Union. The message in Trump\u2019s tweet and reinforced by his supporters far and wide is that the polls are simply wrong. It\u2019s no mystery why the campaign doesn\u2019t like what the polls say, but are Trump and his campaign and supporters doing the right thing in questioning their accuracy? Yes, the polls in Britain were wrong, but this isn\u2019t Britain and this isn\u2019t a low-turnout referendum. This is the dadgum presidency. And the polls on the presidency have been consistently correct for generations. For your primer on the validity of polling, read Nate Silver\u2019s treatise on the topic. His conclusion is that in lower turnout elections, polling can be more challenging, but when it comes to the big Kahuna, polls have done a good job. The most glaring error in presidential polling, the 1948 election, was not just in the relative infancy of public opinion work, but the result of a special set of circumstances. If you choose to believe that this is the year in which the polls are all wrong, you may have also thought that Mitt Romney was going to win in 2012. He didn\u2019t and, for now, Trump isn\u2019t. When Romney\u2019s campaign starting spitting mumbo jumbo about the polls being wrong, it was late in the race and the Republicans were only too ready to grasp at straws. But on election night, the verdict was clear. Pollsters had done their jobs well, but the GOP hadn\u2019t. Disputing the polls in August is something different. Losing candidates usually blow off polls because they don\u2019t want their supporters to give up hope. A little of this gamesmanship is part of almost every election cycle. The epitaph of every losing campaign might read, \u201cThe only poll that matters is on Election Day.\u201d But 82 days is a long time to be whistling past the graveyard. One wouldn\u2019t expect a campaign to say that it was losing, or at least not to emphasize the point. But it is not good practice to invite supporters to ignore reality. Doing so also allows a campaign to ignore reality itself. As we have discussed, Trump needs the race reset in order to be competitive. Pooh poohing the polls a bit, but making ready for a comeback is one thing. Pretending that the polls aren\u2019t real is quite another. If Trump and his campaign do not level with voters, and stop with the stuff about Twitter followers and rally sizes, the eventual falloff will be even greater. Big rallies and active social media accounts are certainly good measures of the intensity of voters, but terrible metrics for overall sentiment. It would be like gaging the temperature of your home by sticking your head in the freezer. The heartbreak that followed 2012 for Republicans was made much worse for those who were not forced to confront reality sooner. It may have been too late in Romney\u2019s case for the truth to set him free, but that is not so this time. With more than 11 weeks to go, Trump could certainly close that gap or Clinton could collapse in the polls. But if he is living in an alternate reality, there would be no incentive for Trump to change direction. Comebacks are hard, but not that rare in presidential politics, as we\u2019ve in 1948, 1980, and 1988. Pretending that one is not necessary, though, is no way to get a comeback started.TIME OUT: BUT, IT\u2019S CHOCOLATESlate talks about how Roald Dahl\u2019s whimsical works always involve food and the perils of those who overindulge: \u201cRoald Dahl wrote swirling sugar fantasias, palaces of chocolate, and a floating, dripping den of peach flesh.

            "article_content": "Eric Shawn reports from New York Once was apparently not enough for Pasco Parker. Prosecutors say the 63-year-old Tennessee man voted in the 2012 presidential election, not once ... not twice ... but three times, in three different states. \"It's too easy to vote twice, it comes down to your honor,\" said Jay DeLancy, executive director of North Carolina volunteer voting watchdog group The Voting Integrity Project, which caught Parker. DeLancy cited the case as an example of the kind of voter fraud that some have dismissed as overblown. \"It's a lot more widespread than what people think, because the general public thinks there is no voter fraud. As proof they look at prosecutions, but we have learned how difficult it is to get prosecutions,\" he said. It was DeLancy's group that brought Parker's case to the attention of election officials and law enforcement \u2013 and Parker is not alone. His was one of 149 cases of suspected double-voting DeLancy says his group has turned over. In Parker\u2019s case, he was charged with voter fraud for votes in the Nov. 6, 2012, presidential election. He voted in person at his polling place in Spring Hill, Tenn. Authorities say that was after previously mailing in another vote by absentee ballot in Florida on Oct. 28, and yet another absentee ballot vote in North Carolina the following day. He pleaded guilty to felony voter registration and felony voting fraud in Rutherford County, N.C., last November, and was spared jail time under the law. In Wisconsin, 52-year-old Robert Monroe also was sentenced to jail earlier this year after he was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including multiple voting and voting twice in the 2012 presidential race.\u00a0Prosecutors say Monroe voted by absentee ballot, where he lives in Shorewood, Wis., on Nov. 1, 2012. Then on election day five days later, authorities say he drove four hours south to Lebanon, Ind., to vote in person, using his Indiana drivers license to sign in. Even a 2012 Democratic congressional candidate was caught and had to drop out of the race. Party officials said candidate Wendy Rosen, who was running in Maryland's 1st Congressional District, had voted twice in Maryland and Florida in two separate elections. She pleaded guilty to voting illegally in two elections. And in Cincinnati, veteran poll worker Melowese Richardson was accused of voting twice in the 2012 presidential election, after Hamilton County prosecutors charged her in 2013 with eight counts of illegal voting over several elections. She pleaded guilty to four counts, and prosecutors said she had even voted in the presidential election for her sister, who had been in a coma for almost a decade. Richardson was sentenced to five years in prison but was released early. In Kansas, Lincoln Wilson also was charged with voting in both that state and in Colorado, where records show he is a registered Republican. He was accused of multiple counts stemming from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 elections. And this past June, it turned out that the California presidential primary was not immune to the double-voting phenomenon. The East Bay Times reported that \"in just three counties, Contra Costa, Alameda and Santa Clara, 194 people voted twice, suggesting the abuse statewide might run into the thousands.\" Some suggest the number of potential double voters could be much higher than that. A 2012 Pew Center on The States study said \"approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.\" Pew said 68,000 people were registered in three states, and 1,807 were even registered in three states. Others contend the matches of voters' names in two or multiple states are merely coincidences and clerical errors, and that the potential for people voting more than once is overblown. The Brennan Center for Justice, considered the nation's leading election system monitoring group, issued a 2007 report on the problem. It said \"these cases are extremely rare, in part because the penalty (criminal prosecution) is so severe, and the payoff (one incremental vote) is so minimal. It is far more common, however, to see allegations of epidemic double-voting that are unfounded. Such claims are usually premised on matching lists of voters from one place to another, but upon closer inspection, the match process shows error.\u201d While elections officials insist that there are sufficient safeguards to prevent double-voting, DeLancy fears the possibility is very real, as evidenced by the cases his group has seen. He says prosecutors need to do more. \"Election fraud is a crime against the entire American public. It is a crime against the Constitution and a crime against the foundations of our nation,\" he said. Follow Eric Shawn on Twitter: @EricShawnTV Ben Evansky contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Washington, D.C. WASHINGTON \u2013 Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her presidential bid with a resounding campaign cash advantage over Donald Trump. New fundraising reports show her campaign and joint accounts with Democrats had $153 million in the bank as of last week. That's more than double the $68 million Trump's campaign and partnership committees had on hand. Clinton's continued fundraising advantage helps ensure the Democratic nominee can keep her sprawling political operation at full strength in the frantic final days of the race. She maintains a staff of more than 800 -- several times larger than Trump's -- and has spent more on advertising than the Republican has every single week of the race. Over the course of the primary and general elections, Clinton's campaign has hauled in $513 million, roughly double what Trump's has. She outpaced him again in the first 19 days of October, the new reports show, when her campaign reaped $53 million as his brought in about $30 million. While Trump, a New York businessman who says he is worth $10 billion, typically makes a personal contribution of about $2 million each month, he had not done so yet in October. The latest contribution reports, up to date as of Wednesday, show he had given only about $33,000. The candidates and many outside groups involved in the presidential race are filing their final pre-election fundraising reports on Thursday. The filings cover the first 19 days of the month. Outside groups backing Clinton are better funded than those supporting Trump, the reports show. Super PACS can take unlimited contributions from wealthy donors, but they may not coordinate with the campaigns. The pro-Clinton Priorities USA raised $18 million in 19 days. Some of its biggest most recent donors include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Susan Mandel, the wife of a hedge fund founder, who each put in $2.5 million this month. Priorities USA has been spending most of its money on TV ads. It plans to spend $21 million on ads this week and next, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker. Rebuilding America Now, one of several pro-Trump groups, raised only about $215,000 through the early part of this month. As of last week, the super PAC only had about $1.2 million in cash on hand. Another, Great America PAC, raised $2 million and had about as much left to spend.",

            "article_content": "Hillary spokesman rips billionaire The 2016 presidential race now appears in full scandal mode -- with accusations this weekend about Donald Trump being a tax dodger and Hillary Clinton being privately indifferent to the millennial voters whose support she needs -- with no end in sight. To be sure, Trump has even vowed to bring up at the next presidential debate claims about former President Bill Clinton having extra-marital affairs and wife Hillary\u2019s apparent attempts to silence the women accusers -- despite fellow Republicans urging him to avoid such a strategy. And he suggested Saturday that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, might have been unfaithful to her husband. On Sunday, Trump, the Republican nominee, seemed ready to refocus on policy and his effective economic agenda -- at least slightly more. \u201cI have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!\u201d tweeted Trump, referring to the now-closed federal investigation into Clinton using a private server system while secretary of state. With about five weeks remaining before Election Day, Clinton holds a slight lead over Trump, according to most polls published after their debate last week in which Trump appeared to get off track in the closing stages. A Fox News Channel poll released Friday shows Clinton leading by 5 percentage points, 49-to-44 percent. The fresh round of accusations started Friday when an audiotape of a Clinton fundraiser in February surfaced and revealed her candid albeit unflattering portrait of millennials, then turned Saturday night to speculation about whether Trump has paid federal taxes since the mid-1990s, following a New York Times report. \u201cBombshell,\u201d Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted after the story, which appeared to show Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 IRS return and speculated that he might not have paid federal taxes for the next 18 years, as a result. However, such speculation, amid Trump, a New York real estate mogul, not releasing his tax returns, was beat back Sunday by top surrogates and advisers. \u201cNo apologies for complying with the law,\u201d New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He argued that Trump showed business \u201cgenius\u201d in using the laws to his advantage and that he is the best candidate to fix the laws that are an \u201cabsolute mess.\u201d \u201cThis was actually a very, very good story for him,\u201d Christie continued. \u201c\u201cYou don\u2019t know that he didn\u2019t pay taxes. Let\u2019s be precise about what (the story) said.\u201d Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d described Trump as an \"absolute genius\" in how he used tax law to his advantage. In the audiotape released Friday -- which was purportedly hacked from an email, then given to The Washington Free Beacon -- Clinton portrays millennial as \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement\u201d and as college-educated \u201cbaristas\u201d concerned about a bleak economic future. However, she warns about overpromising them, as primary rival-turned campaign supporter Bernie Sanders did. Sanders, a Vermont senator, acknowledged Sunday on CNN that he was bothered by Clinton\u2019s comments, saying his and her campaigns still have \u201creal differences,\u201d beyond their mutual interest in defeating Trump. \u201cCrooked H is nasty to Sanders supporters behind closed doors,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOwned by Wall St and Politicians, HRC is not with you.\u201d The campaigns, which historically go into full attack mode in the final weeks, could return to arguments about policy and platforms when the vice-presidential nominees -- Virginia Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine and Indian GOP Gov. Mike Pence -- meet Tuesday in their first-and-only debate of the election cycle. However, both are veteran politicians who have rigorously attacked Trump and Clinton, respectively, and will likely include such tactics when they go face to face. Clinton made a stop Sunday at a church in Charlotte, N.C., an event postponed because of rioting late last month after a police officer fatally shot a black male. Trump held a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, where he made no mention of the Miss Universe winner, whom Clinton said during the debate Monday was verbally abused by Trump. Trump spent much of the rest of the week attacking the pageant queen\u2019s character, even implying she participated in a sex tape and arguing that Clinton had been duped into championing her. \u201cI don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really folks, why should she be, right?\u201d he told the crowd in Pennsylvania, a critical state in Clinton and Trump\u2019s path toward the White House. Trump returns to the campaign trail Monday with an event in northern Virginia, while Clinton makes two stops in battleground Ohio, where Trump now appears to be doing especially well. Her visit comes about one week prior to Ohio's voter-registration deadline, October 11, and the start of early voting, October 12. On Wednesday, President Obama will stump for Clinton in the Miami-area of Florida, another key state for both candidates and where their race also remains close.",

            "article_content": "The estimated 27 victims of so-called \"honor killings\" each year in the U.S. don't fit neatly into the FBI's exhaustive Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics. Hidden among thousands of nondescript murders and cases labeled as domestic violence are a mounting number of killings motivated by a radical and dark interpretation of Islam. Honor killings and violence, which typically see men victimize wives and daughters because of behavior that has somehow insulted their faith, are among the most secretive crimes in society, say experts. \u201cCases of honor killings and/or violence in the U.S. are often unreported because of the shame it can cause to the victim and the victim\u2019s family,\u201d Farhana Qazi, a former U.S. government analyst and senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies on Terrorism, told FoxNews.com. \u201cAlso, because victims are often young women, they may feel that reporting the crime to authorities will draw too much attention to the family committing the crime.\u201d \u201cI learned very quickly that we would receive no assistance from the family. In fact, we received out-and-out defiance and resistance.\" Even cases that appear to be honor killings, such as the Jan. 1, 2008 murder of two Irving, Texas, sisters that landed their father on the FBI's most wanted list, cannot always be conclusively linked to a religious motivation. Without hard evidence, critics say, ascribing a religious motivation to crimes committed by Muslims demeans Islam. Yet, federal authorities believe they must be able to identify \"honor\" as a motive for violence and even murder if they are to address a growing cultural problem. \u201cHonor Violence Measurement Methods,\u201d a study released earlier this year by research corporation Westat, and commissioned by the U.S. Department of Justice, identified four types of honor violence: forced marriage, honor-based domestic violence, honor killing and female genital mutilation. The report, which estimated that 23-27 honor killings per year occur in the U.S., noted that 91 percent of victims in North America are murdered for being \u201ctoo Westernized,\u201d and in incidents involving daughters 18 years or younger, a father is almost always involved. And for every honor killing, there are many more instances of physical and emotional abuse, all in the name of fundamentalist Islam, say experts. Yasser Said has been on the run since Jan. 1, 2008, when authorities say he killed his two daughters because they were becoming to westernized. (FBI) \u201cTypically seen in the form of physical or emotional abuse, rape or kidnapping, honor violence also includes harmful practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM) and forced marriage. In extreme cases, murder,\u201d said Stephanie Baric, executive director of the AHA Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by women\u2019s rights activist and FGM survivor Ayaan Hirsi Ali. \u201cIn sharp contrast with domestic violence, families and communities often condone honor violence, which makes it more difficult to identify and stop.\u201d While women are generally the victims of honor violence, men also may be targeted if they reject an arranged marriage or are assumed to be homosexual. Victims may also be pressured to commit suicide, and may do so without even realizing they are victims of honor-motivated violence, said Baric. Peoria, Ariz., homicide detectives Chris Boughey, (l.), and Jeff Balson, (r.), have made it their mission to educate other law-enforcement officers about honor violence. (Courtesy: Chris Boughey) For police who encounter apparent honor crimes, the investigation is typically treated as a regular crime or murder probe, usually under the umbrella of domestic violence. While both issues are tragic and problematic, experts say there are critical distinctions, and that honor violence requires a different approach. Detective Chris Boughey, of Peoria, Ariz., calls Oct. 20, 2009, a day that \u201cchanged my life forever.\u201d That was the day Iraqi immigrant Faleh Almaleki murdered his daughter, Noor Almaleki, by running her over with his vehicle for becoming \u201ctoo Westernized.\u201d Boughey was assigned as the lead investigator and has since dedicated his career to educating others and taking on similar cases in numerous other states -- from Alaska and New York to California, Washington state and Pennsylvania. In 2012, the mother, father and sister of 19-year-old Aiya Altameemi were charged with beating her because she refused an arranged marriage to an older man. \u201cIn the Almaleki case, I learned very quickly that we would receive no assistance from the family,\" Boughey said. \"In fact, we received out-and-out defiance and resistance. Although we know they are involved, it can be very hard to prove in a court of law.\u201d Other honor-motivated tragedies in the U.S. have garnered headlines. - In 2012, police arrested the mother, father and sister of 19-year-old Aiya Altameemi in Phoenix after they allegedly beat, restrained and burned her for reportedly declining an arranged marriage with an older man and talking to another boy. - In 2009, Aasiya Hassan was beheaded by her husband, Muzzammil Hassan, at the Buffalo, N.Y., Muslim TV station where they worked for allegedly requesting a divorce. The Pakistani-born killer defended himself at trial, never denied his guilt and was convicted in 2011. A few months before Hassan was killed, Sandeela Kanwal was strangled by her father outside Atlanta for failing to \u201cbe true to her religion\u201d because she wanted to leave an arranged marriage. - In the 2008 case in Irving, Yasser Said, a cab driver from Egypt, is suspected of shooting his two daughters, Amina, 18, and Sarah Said, 17, in the back of his taxi because they were dating non-Muslim boys and embracing Western culture. Said has been a fugitive ever since. - In 2007, an Illinois man \u2013 Subhash Chander \u2013 set an apartment fire that killed his pregnant 22-year-old daughter, son-in-law and 3-year-old grandson because he disapproved of the marriage. - And in one of the earliest widely reported cases of honor killing in the U.S., 16-year-old Palestina Isa, of St. Louis, was murdered in 1989 by her father Zein Isa, who was helped by her mother. Zein Isa was angry that his daughter had gotten a job and was dating an African-American boy. Both parents were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Zein Isa died on death row in 1997, while his wife's sentence was commuted to life in prison without parole. Honor violence is an even bigger problem in other parts of the Western world, with a reported 11,000 cases of honor violence recorded in the United Kingdom in the last five years while incidents also have been documented in Canada, Germany, France and Sweden. Baric affirmed that given immigration trends in the last decade -- an influx from Middle Eastern and South Asian countries where honor violence is part of the culture -- the problem will continue to worsen if authorities don't identify and address it. Boughey said honor violence, whether it be abuse and murder, FGM, or forced marriage -- is much more widespread in America than most people realize and, as it stands, authorities have no proper system in place to track it. \u201cHonor violence has been largely misclassified by law enforcement, by no fault of their own,\" he said. \"They simply didn\u2019t know the signs and symptoms of honor-related violence. They do not have the training on how to effectively identify and investigate these cases.\u201d One of the biggest challenges, Boughey said, is the social pressures to not be deemed \u201cculturally insensitive.\u201d That can keep social service agencies from alerting law enforcement when honor violence crosses their radar. \u201cSome agencies won\u2019t intervene even after these young women have come forward,\" he said. \"I am not quite sure when we as a country decided that it was more important to be politically correct than doing the right thing.\u201d Boughey and his police partner Jeff Balson, working with the AHA Foundation, have developed a curriculum to train law enforcement and members of social service organizations to properly identity such cases, as well as provide adequate help for victims and advocate the need for legislation to be enacted specific to honor violence. Mainstream Muslims condemn honor violence without equivocation, said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). \u201cIf anyone mistreats women, they should not seek refuge in Islam,\u201d he said. Republican Muslim Coalition Executive Director Saba Ahmed also said such \u201cbarbaric acts\u201d are in total conflict with the teachings of Islam. In 2013, President Obama signed the Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act, which prohibits the transportation of a child from the U.S. for the intent of FGM and in 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services held a civil society listening session on the domestic response to the violation. Whether or not the federal government will take further measures to address honor violence remains to be seen, and the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment regarding its action plan based on the study it funded. But according to Paula Kweskin, human rights lawyer and producer of the Clarion Project\u2019s documentary \u201cHonor Diaries,\u201d the most important thing to be done to combat the issue is to talk about it loudly and frequently. \u201cHonor violence can result in murder,\" Kweskin said. \"FGM permanently disfigures a woman. Honor violence can shatter communities, causing suffering for generations to come. Culture is no excuse for abuse. We cannot let women suffer in silence any longer.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Female hands tied with tape measure fighting eating disorder Young teen girls are more likely to count calories, skip meals and engage in other risky dieting behaviors if they're experiencing family conflict or have symptoms of depressed mood, according to a new study from Australia. \"There are many factors associated with the development of risky dieting, including socialization by peers, media, and parents/family,\" said coauthor Adrian B. Kelly of The University of Queensland in an email. \"This study takes a look at the emotional climate of families as an underlying vulnerability of girls to risky dieting.\" In Australia, around 39 percent of teen girls and 13 percent of teen boys engage in intermediate or extreme dieting, Kelly said. The researchers surveyed more than 4,000 girls aged 11 to 14 in 231 schools in three Australian states. Girls answered a questionnaire about specific behaviors including calorie counting, reducing food quantities at meals or skipping meals as a means of controlling weight, rating how often they engaged in each behavior, from \"seldom/never\" to \"almost always.\" They also completed a mood and feelings questionnaire, described how close they were to their fathers and mothers, and rated three items about conflict at home, such as, \"people in my family often insult and yell at each other.\" Those with higher levels of family conflict were also more likely to engage in dieting behavior, and feeling depressed seemed to explain at least part of that connection, according to the results in the journal Eating Behaviors. The researchers accounted for the start of puberty and factored in socioeconomic status based on parents' occupations. Girls with lower socioeconomic status and those who started puberty early, having their first period at age 11 or younger, were more likely than others to diet. \"There are many things that can be done - this study points to the potential value of addressing stressful family events like conflict and working on ways to reduce the negative impact on childrens' emotional wellbeing,\" Kelly told Reuters Health by email. \"We see this area to be something that might supplement other strategies, rather than replace other evidence-based approaches.\" But this study only considered one point in time. It cannot address whether conflict or depression cause risky eating behavior; it only indicates they are somehow connected, the authors write. \"This is one of few studies of a large community sample of girls during their transition to puberty,\" said professor John Toumbourou, chair in health psychology at Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, who was not involved in the research. \"The finding that the effect of family conflict on adolescent dieting may be mediated by depressive symptoms adds weight to the argument that tackling early depressive symptoms may be critical in efforts to prevent unhealthy dieting in adolescent girls,\" Toumbourou told Reuters Health by email. But the findings should be treated cautiously until they are confirmed in long-term studies and researchers test interventions to reduce depression, he said.",

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) The modern Democratic Party is the greatest threat to the free exercise of religion in America\u2019s history. In their attempt to limit religious freedom, they are attacking the foundation of America\u2019s goodness. Never has a major party sought to shove the practice and influence of religion out of the public square like today\u2019s Democrats. Christians are beginning to recognize these attacks. Under President Obama\u2019s watch, we had to fight for the right to practice our faith in business and in community service. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Zubik v. Burwell respectively. In other words, Christians had to sue the government in order to continue to practice their faith. In a recent report, the chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission is quoted as saying, \u201cThe phrases \u2018religious liberty\u2019 and \u2018religious freedom\u2019 will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.\u201d In the minds of the Obama administration, religious freedom is nothing more than discrimination and intolerance. In the minds of the Obama administration, religious freedom is nothing more than discrimination and intolerance. In the recent 2016 Democratic Party Platform, religious freedom is qualified. You can only practice religious freedom as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with \u201cgay rights\u201d or \u201cabortion rights.\u201d The party platform also seeks, for the first time ever, to force taxpayers to fund abortions, even if it violates their conscience. Bow down to government first, your religion second. Democrats have also sought to strip public funding from Christian colleges, making it harder for poor and minority students to attend. They have created \"hate lists\" of Christian and Catholic schools. They have threatened to deny Christian schools their tax exempt status and their accreditation. They are also seeking to remove all Christian and Catholic colleges from the NCAA. Democrats have censored pastors\u2019 sermons, fired public officials because of what they wrote in a Bible study, and punished bakers, florists, and wedding photographers with massive fines simply for wanting to practice their faith in their businesses. Democrats are treating people of faith like criminals. Democrats are telling you that you can practice your faith quietly and within the walls of your home and church, your faith just cannot influence any public activity. Tell that to the millions of Christians, Jews, and Muslims who practice their faith 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Tell that to the great social reformers: Martin Luther King Jr., William Wilberforce, Harriet Tubman, and George Washington who made their impact on society because of their faith. On Thursday, Donald Trump met with over 30 religious leaders from across the country to discuss religious freedom issues. Mr. Trump was attentive, interested, inquisitive, and at the end \u2013 committed to protecting religious freedom. We explored the history of religion and virtue in shaping our country, the importance of protecting religious freedom for businesses, schools, non-profits, and churches themselves. He reconfirmed his commitment to protecting the rights of pastors to speak freely from the pulpit. We discussed international religious freedom and that God has blessed the United States of America in order that we can be a blessing to all nations. Listening to our discussion about the Democratic Party\u2019s attack on religious freedom, Mr. Trump closed by saying: \u201cUnder my leadership, this will all change. The religious freedom of Americans will be protected and strengthened.\u201d While one party seeks to totally squash the practice of religion, Donald Trump is actively seeking to understand and fortify religious freedom. During the primaries, I condemned Donald Trump\u2019s remarks about women, the disabled, and minorities. I have never justified nor excused those comments. Our president must act better. But when it comes to the policies that will affect every single American, Hillary Clinton\u2019s attack on religion makes her totally unqualified to be the president of the United States. Her policies are in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution and will limit the rights of millions of Americans to run a business, provide community service, worship, or educate in accordance with their religious beliefs.",

            "article_content": "In this Aug. 16, 2012 file photo, the Time Warner Cable Arena is shown on left of downtown Charlotte, N.C.    To much of the world, Charlotte is the Queen City, a gleaming downtown, state-of-the-art stadiums, sparkling new mass transit, the nation's banking capital. But a very different Charlotte came into the spotlight in the past few days. Move outside the city's core and there are neighborhoods like the one where a police officer shot and killed a black man, Keith Scott, Sept. 20, 2016, setting off violent protests.(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (The Associated Press) CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2013 To much of the world, Charlotte is the Queen City \u2014 a gleaming downtown, state-of-the-art stadiums, sparkling new mass transit, the nation's banking capital. But a very different Charlotte came into the spotlight in the past few days. Move outside the city's core and there are neighborhoods such as the one where a\u00a0black\u00a0police officer shot and killed a\u00a0black\u00a0man, Keith Scott, setting off violent protests. Places where residents tire of seeing police only when teams of officers sweep in to make arrests, and remember well other\u00a0blacks\u00a0killed by police officers who did not face punishment. Their anger at Scott's death made its way downtown. Rioting in Charlotte's center killed one protester, shattered windows and rattled finance executives whose salaries boost the city's median income to $10,000 above the national average. They told their workers in the skyscrapers to stay home. To the protesters, home is a world away from those skyscrapers. \"For the people we serve, the Queen City is only the Queen City if you get on the train and ride into the glimmering, crystal core,\" said the Rev. Peter Wherry of Mayfield Memorial Missionary Baptist Church, about 5 miles from downtown. Nearly all of Charlotte lies in Mecklenburg County, which the U.S. Census Bureau estimated had the largest increase in the country in the percentage of people living in distressed neighborhoods during the first 15 years of this century \u2014 an index that combines unemployment, poverty rates and other items, like how many businesses close. Those pockets of poverty aren't immediately evident. Charlotte doesn't have many stereotypical slums. Instead, lower-rent housing is in apartment complexes or condominiums nestled behind tree-lined roads or off the main thoroughfares. That's the kind of place where Scott lived. Tracy McLean lived in the condominium complex just down the road; she said teams of police frequently come to the neighborhoods full of\u00a0black\u00a0and Latino families in a show of force, looking for suspects they often don't find, instead of talking to residents and getting to know them. \"The fear needs to be dispelled,\" Tracy McLean said. \"It's fear, and it's ridiculous fear.\" In the mid-1990s, as Charlotte pushed to become a world-class city, its leaders cracked down on crime with a heavy-handed police force. Longtime African-American residents remember James Cooper, a 19-year-oldblack\u00a0man killed by a white officer in 1996 as he reached back in his car window during a traffic stop to check on his 4-year-old daughter. The officer said he thought he had a gun. They also remember Carolyn Boetticher, a passenger in a car that sped toward and then past white officers doing a license check in a high-crime neighborhood. Police fired 22 shots that came from the front, side and rear of the fleeing car. She was shot in the neck. None of the officers faced criminal charges, but Charlotte created a citizen review panel for its police department. And even when Charlotte police seem to get it right, the\u00a0black\u00a0community\u00a0has been left feeling justice was not served. Jonathan Ferrell was a 24-year-old unarmed\u00a0black\u00a0man shot 10 times by white officer Randall Kerrick. Ferrell had just crashed his car in a suburban neighborhood and banged on a neighbor's door looking for help. She called 911. Charlotte police charged Kerrick with voluntary manslaughter one day later. But the jury couldn't reach a unanimous verdict at his trial, and state prosecutors decided not to retry the case. There were peaceful protests then, which prompted headlines like, \"How Charlotte Avoided Ferguson's Fate.\" Activist Jibril Hough organized those peaceful protests. He said Charlotte's\u00a0black\u00a0community\u00a0remembers Ferrell's death, and that pain has just been made worse by recent shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and elsewhere. \"I think if Jonathan Ferrell would happen today instead of happening three years ago, you would get much of the same reaction as you've seen in the past 48 hours,\" he said. \"It's been building, but it's not just what happened here in Charlotte. We have social media now, people see what's happening in other states.\" Hough calls Charlotte \"Oz,\" a city that cares about its appearance and the people who live in its $400,000 one-bedroom downtown condos and eat $50 steak lunches, but not about substance. \"When people come into town, they see nice, shiny buildings. But when it comes to working-class people, they don't put pressure on these businesses to say what are you going to do for the working class,\" Hough said. The growing economic disparity in Charlotte and the recent violence is on the mind of Hugh McColl, the former CEO of Bank of America who was the most public face of a group of bank executives that relentlessly boosted Charlotte during its massive growth to a city on the world's stage over the past three decades. If Charlotte wants to keep rapidly growing, it must provide affordable housing, a better standard of living and good paying jobs for people of all races and especially for children growing up in poor households, McColl said to the crowd during a free concert Friday by the Charlotte Symphony. \"Black\u00a0lives do matter. All lives matter. Our children's lives matter, and their future matters a great deal,\" McColl said. A similar message comes from the Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP. When people work two jobs but don't make enough to own a home, they get discouraged, and seeing video after video of\u00a0black\u00a0men dying makes them lose hope and start to wonder if they matter to society, Barber said. It reminded him of his lifeguard days, when Barber said he was warned that drowning people would violently fight off the swimmers trying to help them out of confusion and fear. \"The type of riots we are seeing in Charlotte is a systemic response for people who are drowning in injustice,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "education, elementary school, learning and people concept - teacher helping school kids writing test in classroom (iStock) Children in low-income families who get extra help building social skills before kindergarten may behave better and get higher grades than their peers, a small study suggests. Researchers focused on kids that are traditionally at high risk for mental health problems and academic underachievement - low-income minority children attending high-poverty urban schools. The experiment included 10 public schools in New York City serving predominantly poor, black students. Half of those schools participated in ParentCorps, a program for pre-kindergarten families that teaches kids skills like sharing and expressing their emotions and offers parents coaching in how to encourage positive behavior in their children. By second grade, kids at schools with ParentCorps were half as likely to have clinically significant mental health problems, compared to peers at non-participating schools, and had higher teacher-reported academic performances, said lead study author Laurie Miller Brotman of New York University Langone Medical Center. \"This suggests that ParentCorps delivered as an enhancement to pre-k programs serving primarily low-income children of color has the potential to improve population health and reduce disparities,\" Brotman said by email. \"These findings suggest that as early childhood education programs become increasingly available to 4-year olds throughout the country, additional investment in supporting parents and early childhood teachers to create safe, nurturing and predictable environments for children has the potential to reduce disparities in education and health,\" Brotman added. The ParentCorps experiment included 423 children and families that participated in the program and 369 kids at schools without the program. Parents attended 13 weekly two-hour sessions devoted to things like goal-setting and helping children regulate emotions. At the same time, children attended play-based sessions designed to promote self-regulation skills like paying attention and identifying feelings. Teachers also received professional development. For children in schools without ParentCorps, mental health problems observed by teachers increased during the study period, while this remained unchanged in the schools that did have the program. There was also a less pronounced achievement gap between black and white students in schools with ParentCorps, the study found. One way ParentCorps may get results is by reducing stress, the authors conclude. Even though researchers didn't measure stress, many previous studies have linked stressors at home and in the community to poor behavior and academic performance in school. Beyond its small size, limitations of the study include the potential for teacher ratings of students to be biased because educators at the ParentCorps schools were aware of the mission, the authors note. However, second grade teachers didn't know whether students had participated in ParentCorps when they were in pre-k, the authors also point out. The results also highlight the importance of parental involvement, Dr. Caroline Kistin, a researcher at Boston University Medical Center who wrote an accompanying editorial. \"The findings of this study are consistent with previous findings that the social-emotional health of young children is one of the biggest factors that impacts school readiness and future school success,\" Kistin said by email. \"The parent-child relationship has a major influence on child social emotional development and can be a powerful buffer against stress.\" While it's possible a program like ParentCorps might work differently outside of New York City, plenty of previous research suggests that focusing on both school and home environments can have a big impact on educational outcomes, Kistin added by email. \"A number of studies have demonstrated that high-quality early education programs can impact child well-being and educational attainment,\" Kistin said. \"One of the novel aspects of ParentCorps is the focus on both the home and the school environments. The involvement of parents in particular may be the key to decreasing child stress and improving outcomes in the years that follow.\"",

A settlement is expected today with a company spokesman telling the Journal that Infosys has set aside $35 million for the case. The fine sends a strong message to Infosys clients and other large American corporations that a crackdown is coming. That comes as the Obama administration is urging big businesses to ratchet up the pressure on House Republicans to accept a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Senate plan on immigration that loosens restrictions on guest worker visas and would grant permanent legal residency to millions of illegal immigrants. A coalition of about 600 mostly Republican leaders in business and agriculture have all ready begun to actively lobby close to 80 House Republicans this week to bring the legislation to the floor.

Obama kept his distance from trailing Democrat Creigh Deeds four years ago, but with the president in trouble on multiple fronts, especially his foundering new health-insurance program, Obama could benefit from being associated with a winning effort. There\u2019s a downside for McAuliffe in Obama\u2019s Sunday visit, though: McAuliffe will see an increasingly popular campaign surrogate replaced by an increasingly unpopular one. Former President Bill Clinton continues his multi-day pitch for McAuliffe with visits to James Madison University in Harrisonburg and later in Charlottesville. YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL - And so do top candidates\u2026 Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli took the Center Seat on \u201cSpecial report with Bret Baier\u201d to face questions from the host and the members of the All-Star Panel. Cuccinelli\u2019s tax plan was a winner with male and female viewers, as tracked by Bing Pulse. Of note: Democrats agreed when Cuccinelli said Democrat Terry McAuliffe\u2019s agenda would result in higher taxes and lower economic output. Cuccinelli\u2019s quip, \u201cI have never won a race without Republican, Independent and Democrat and Libertarian and vegetarian support,\u201d saw viewer response spike to a high of 16,000 votes per minute. Republicans, Democrats, and independents strongly agreed when Weekly Standard Senior Writer Stephen Hayes said ongoing concerns about the ObamaCare rollout debacle will mean pushback from blue-state senators in 2014 races. Democrats also agreed with Hayes when he described ObamaCare as \u201cobnoxious paternalism.\u201d Columnist Charles Krauthammer drew strong agreement from both genders when he said ObamaCare was part of the \u201cliberal ideology Obama is imposing on the country\u201d drawing comparisons to the president\u2019s push for a green economy.

CONTRADICTORY ADS AGAINST MCCONNELL - Kentucky Democratic hopeful Allison Lundergran Grimes and Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin are both taking to the airwaves to attack Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for his part in brokering the deal that ended the most recent partial government shutdown. But the two messages may be cancelling each other out. Bevin\u2019s ad excoriates McConnell for working with Democrats on a deal to help end the government shutdown while Grimes assails the Senate Republican for being the cause of gridlock. McConnell\u2019s campaign response: They\u2019re both kind of right.

Certainly having a full scale meltdown in your party less than a month from a quadrennial election is not a good thing. And it may, in fact, turn Trump\u2019s impending defeat into a rout of Goldwaterian proportions. But if he loses, the root cause will be Trump\u2019s failures outside of the Republican Party. An astonishing 30 million or so Republicans participated in primaries and caucuses this year. As Trump often points out, he received more votes than any nominee in history. He doesn\u2019t point out, however, that more votes were cast against him than any prior nominee. But if all 16.1 million people who voted or caucused against him and all 13.6 million people who voted or caucused for him marched to the polls to vote for him in the general election, he would still be about 40 million votes short. As Trump bellows into his Twitter machine about the disloyalty of House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump supporters go scalp hunting for conservative Republicans who have turned their backs on the party\u2019s nominee, bear in mind this simple truth: there are more Democrats in America than there are Republicans. To win elections, the GOP needs to win a lopsided majority of independent voters. That\u2019s just the way it is. Coming out of the first debate, Trump was hemorrhaging support among swing voters. His feud with a former beauty queen sealed in the minds of many voters every allegation Clinton had made about Trump. That it would be followed by audio of Trump joking about sexual assault was a calamity of historic proportions. The conservative press and the mainstream press are going to spend much of the next 20 days kindling every spark they can find of the fires of enmity in the Republican Party. This is satisfying for both Democrats and Trump supporters. The narrative that the betrayal by the Speaker of the House or other establishment Republicans is to blame for Trump\u2019s failures makes Trump feel better, and cheers Democrats because it is a foretaste of a permanently, hopelessly, divided opposition party in the years to come. But do not let them fool you. Trump supporters are threatening to abandon down-ballot Republicans who do not back Trump to the hilt. Establishmentarians and conservatives are withdrawing their support for Trump to deny him victory. While these acts of protest no doubt satisfy the hatreds that now animate the GOP from an electoral standpoint, this is chicken feed compared to those other 40 million voters Republicans need to be a viable party.THE RULEBOOK: \u2018SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION\u2019\u201cThe republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests.\u201d\u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71TIME OUT: HOOKED ON PHONICSNew Yorker: \u201cLong before he tried opium, Thomas De Quincey, the English essayist, was addicted to books.

In the Badger State, once thought to be a possible win for Trump, gives Clinton an 8-point advantage in a Loras College poll of the four-way race, conducted before the release of a vulgar tape of Trump making lewd comments about women and also prior to the second debate. There is some good news for the GOP, however, on the Senate level. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., was thought to be a for sure loss when former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., entered the race, but the two are only separated by 5 points showing Johnson may have some fighting power left before Election Day. But Virginia, which looks less like a swing state with each poll, Clinton takes a 9-point lead in a new Roanoke College poll of the four-way race. In the two-way race, Clinton\u2019s lead widens to 13 points.

            "article_content": "New Jersey governor and head of Trump's White House transition team on 'Fox News Sunday' A federal prosecutor told jurors Monday that a witness will testify that Republican Gov. Chris Christie was told about a plan to close traffic lanes near the George Washington Bridge as it was happening, a claim he has contested for years. Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna made the revelation in opening statements at the trial of Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly, two former allies of Christie. Baroni was a top Christie appointee to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge, and Kelly was Christie's deputy chief of staff. The trial comes three years after gridlock paralyzed a New Jersey town next to the busy bridge for four days. Prosecutors say it was a criminal conspiracy cooked up by Baroni and Kelly to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich out of political revenge. Khanna told jurors that David Wildstein, another Port Authority official, will testify he and Baroni made Christie aware of the plan during a 9/11 memorial in New York City in 2013, three days after the gridlock started. \"The evidence will show that ... they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned,\" Khanna said. Christie has denied knowing about the scheme. A message left at his office Monday seeking comment wasn't immediately returned. Christie wasn't charged in the federal investigation, and a New Jersey state legislative probe also concluded he didn't know about the alleged scheme. But the trial is expected to produce new revelations on who in Christie's inner circle may have known about the plans or subsequent cover-up. Christie, an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, conceded last week that the bridge scandal was a factor in GOP nominee Donald Trump's not picking him as a running mate. According to a federal indictment, Kelly and Baroni conspired to reduce access lanes to the bridge in Fort Lee, across the Hudson River from New York City, in September 2013 after the town's Democratic mayor declined to endorse Christie's re-election. About 150,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day, making it one of the world's busiest. They face counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, deprivation of civil rights and misusing an organization receiving federal funds. The organization is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs area bridges, tunnels and transit hubs and is where Baroni served as deputy executive director. The most serious charge in the indictment, wire fraud conspiracy, carries a maximum 20-year prison term. Prosecutors are expected to introduce texts and emails showing the defendants joking about the traffic jams even as Sokolich -- who hadn't been notified ahead of time about the closures -- called and sent emails seeking help. They'll also show jurors an email from Kelly to another Port Authority official a month before the traffic jams saying, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" That official, Wildstein, pleaded guilty in 2015 and will be the government's key witness. Wildstein is a onetime political blogger and high school classmate of Christie's who served as the Port Authority's director of interstate capital projects, a position created for him. Kelly and Baroni have said in court filings that the government has twisted federal law to turn their actions into crimes. They also have said other people with more power and influence were involved but aren't being prosecuted.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Carol Jones knows what she wants to hear Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump discuss during their first televised debate: education and jobs. She's far from sure which candidate will earn her vote on Election Day. \"All we see is the cat fighting,\" says the Shirley, Arkansas, retired substitute teacher. At Monday's debate, the 70-year-old says, \"they need to talk about their programs ... but I don't think they will.\" A majority of Americans, like Jones, say they're frustrated, angry \u2014 or both \u2014 with the 2016 presidential election, according to a new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most Americans aren't feeling proud or hopeful about the race, and half feel helpless, the results find. Majorities of Americans want more focus on issues that are important to them, starting with health care, Social Security, education, terrorism and homeland security. Apathy isn't the problem, the survey found. Eighty-six percent of Americans are paying at least some attention to the race. The campaign is certainly hard to miss. Trump and Clinton are the two least popular presidential candidates in history, and their ferocious battle is smashing precedents and dominating public discourse. Trump has built his campaign in large part on attention-getting \u2014 and frequently untrue \u2014 accusations, such as that his opponent \"is the devil\" and President Barack Obama \"founded\" the Islamic State group. But he's found success linking the nation's immigration woes to its national security concerns, the latter of which is rated by Americans as among the top issues facing the country. Clinton is a former senator and secretary of state who is an avowed foreign and domestic policy wonk. She has tried to make the election, in part, a referendum on Trump's fitness for office. Her recent stumble during an abrupt exit from this year's 9/11 memorial ceremony, captured on video, added to the reality-show quality of the election. Her campaign disclosed that she'd been diagnosed with pneumonia. Clinton and Trump have clear political and stylistic objectives during their first debate Monday, the first of three such showdowns certain to influence the race in its final six weeks. For both, it's about rattling the other candidate \u2014 and not being baited into a less-than-presidential performance. Trump is looking to shore up his credibility with moderate white voters, particularly women, after more than a year of remarks that appeared intolerant or bigoted. Clinton is trying to appeal to young Americans, who are unenthusiastic about her candidacy. Issues? Jones suggests the candidates owe more on that front it to potential voters who don't have access to the internet or the time she has to hunt down their policy positions. \"I went looking on the internet for (Clinton's) position on free (college) education, and it was hard, but I finally found it,\" says the lifelong Democrat, who isn't sold on Clinton because she doesn't trust her, or husband Bill, the former president and governor of Jones' state. \"They need to talk about their programs on this, this and that.\" Whether the candidates ever get to informative discussions of their policy positions and their professional qualifications is unclear. But the demand is there. The survey found that nearly two-thirds of Americans say the campaign focuses too little on the issues that matter to them personally. More than 6 in 10 Americans of both parties agree. A bit more than half say there's been too little focus on the candidates' qualifications, with Democrats being more likely than Republicans to feel that way, 61 percent to 45 percent. And more than half of Americans in the survey said the campaign is focused too much on the personal characteristics of the candidates, with Republicans and Democrats about equally likely to feel that way. The issues Americans care most about? Health care comes in first, with 81 percent listing that as very or extremely important, while similarly high percentages said the same about Social Security, education, terrorism and homeland security. The next most-cited issues: crime and economic growth, which three-quarters of respondents listed as at least very important. Similar majorities cited poverty and taxes. Ranking lower, according to the findings: immigration, with just 61 percent listing the issue as very or extremely important to them. There's bipartisan agreement on the importance of some issues. Nearly identical percentages of Democrats and Republicans call crime and unemployment top issues. At least three-quarters from both parties call Social Security very important. On many other issues, their priorities diverge: Democrats are particularly likely to call health care and poverty top issues, while Republicans are particularly likely to rank terrorism, taxes, debt and foreign policy as very important. About 7 in 10 Democrats but less than half of Republicans named as top issues call gun control and income inequality. Three-quarters of Democrats, but only about a third of Republicans, say the same about racism, the environment and climate change. Republicans are far more likely to name international trade agreements as a very or extremely important issue. And 7 in 10 Republicans, but only about half of Democrats, call immigration a top priority. Among Americans with a favorable opinion of Trump, nearly 8 in 10 say so. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,022 adults was conducted Sept. 15-18 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

            "article_content": "FBI agents dismayed by failure to charge Clinton The decision to let Hillary Clinton off the hook for mishandling classified information has roiled the FBI and Department of Justice, with one person closely involved in the year-long probe telling FoxNews.com that career agents and attorneys on the case unanimously believed the Democratic presidential nominee should have been charged. The source, who spoke to FoxNews.com on the condition of anonymity, said FBI Director James Comey\u2019s dramatic July 5 announcement that he would not recommend to the Attorney General\u2019s office that the former secretary of state be charged left members of the investigative team dismayed and disgusted. More than 100 FBI agents and analysts worked around the clock with six attorneys from the DOJ\u2019s National Security Division, Counter Espionage Section, to investigate the case. \u201cNo trial level attorney agreed, no agent working the case agreed, with the decision not to prosecute -- it was a top-down decision,\u201d said the source, whose identity and role in the case has been verified by FoxNews.com. A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, \u201cIt was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton\u2019s] security clearance yanked.\u201d \u201cIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,\u201d the senior FBI official told Fox News. \u201cWe were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said \u2018but we are doing nothing,\u2019 which made no sense to us.\u201d The FBI declined to comment directly, but instead referred Fox News to multiple public statements Comey has made in which he has thrown water on the idea that politics played a role in the agency\u2019s decision not to recommend charges. \u201cI know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation \u2013 including people in government \u2013 but none of that mattered to us,\u201d Comey said July 5 \u00a0in announcing the FBI\u2019s decision on the Clinton emails. \u201cOpinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way.\" Andrew Napolitano, former judge and senior judicial analyst for Fox News Channel, said many law enforcement agents involved with the Clinton email investigation have similar beliefs. \u201cIt is well known that the FBI agents on the ground, the human beings who did the investigative work, had built an extremely strong case against Hillary Clinton and were furious when the case did not move forward,\u201d said Napolitano. \u201cThey believe the decision not to prosecute came from The White House.\u201d The claim also is backed up by a report in the New York Post this week, which quotes a number of veteran FBI agents saying FBI Director James Comey \u201chas permanently damaged the bureau\u2019s reputation for uncompromising investigations with his cowardly whitewash of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information using an unauthorized private email server.\u201d \u201cThe FBI has politicized itself, and its reputation will suffer for a long time. I hold Director Comey responsible,\u201d Dennis V. Hughes, the first chief of the FBI\u2019s computer investigations unit, told the Post.\u00a0 Retired FBI agent Michael M. Biasello added to the report, saying, \u201cComey has singlehandedly ruined the reputation of the organization.\u201d Especially angering the team, which painstakingly pieced together deleted emails and interviewed witnesses to prove that sensitive information was left unprotected, was the fact that Comey based his decision on a conclusion that a recommendation to charge would not be followed by DOJ prosecutors, even though the bureau\u2019s role was merely to advise, Fox News was told. \u201cBasically, James Comey hijacked the DOJ\u2019s role by saying \u2018no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case,\u2019\u201d the Fox News source said. \u201cThe FBI does not decide who to prosecute and when, that is the sole province of a prosecutor -- that never happens. \u201cI know zero prosecutors in the DOJ\u2019s National Security Division who would not have taken the case to a grand jury,\u201d the source added. \u201cOne was never even convened.\u201d Napolitano agreed, saying the FBI investigation was hampered from the beginning, because there was no grand jury, and no search warrants or subpoenas issued. \u201cThe FBI could not seize anything related to the investigation, only request things. As an example, in order to get the laptop, they had to agree to grant immunity,\u201d Napolitano said. In early 2015, it was revealed that Clinton had used a private email server in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home to conduct government business while serving from 2009-2013. The emails on the private server included thousands of messages that would later be marked classified by the State Department retroactively. Federal law makes it a crime for a government employee to possess classified information in an unsecure manner, and the relevant statute does not require a finding of intent. Although Comey found that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d he said \u201cno charges are appropriate in this case.\u201d Well before Comey\u2019s announcement, which came days after Bill Clinton met in secret with Comey\u2019s boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, there were signs the investigation would go nowhere, the source told FoxNews.com. One was the fact that the FBI forced its agents and analysts involved in the case to sign non-disclosure agreements. \u201cThis is unheard of, because of the stifling nature it has on the investigative process,\u201d the source said. Another oddity was the five so-called immunity agreements granted to Clinton\u2019s State Department aides and IT experts. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff, along with two other State Department staffers, John Bentel and Heather Samuelson, were afforded immunity agreements, as was Bryan Pagliano, Clinton's former IT aide, and Paul Combetta, an employee at Platte River networks, the firm hired to manage her server after she left the State Department. As Fox News has reported, Combetta utilized the computer program \u201cBleachbit\u201d to destroy Clinton\u2019s records, despite an order from Congress to preserve them, and Samuelson also destroyed Clinton\u2019s emails. Pagliano established the system that illegally transferred classified and top secret information to Clinton\u2019s private server. Mills disclosed classified information to the Clinton\u2019s family foundation in the process, breaking federal laws. None should have been granted immunity if no charges were being brought, the source said. \u201c[Immunity] is issued because you know someone possesses evidence you need to charge the target, and you almost always know what it is they possess,\u201d the source said. \u201cThat's why you give immunity.\u201d Mills and Samuelson also received immunity for what was found on their computers, which were then destroyed as a part of negotiations with the FBI. \u201cMills and Samuelson receiving immunity with the agreement their laptops would be destroyed by the FBI afterwards is, in itself, illegal,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe know those laptops contained classified information. That's also illegal, and they got a pass.\u201d Mills\u2019 dual role as Clinton\u2019s attorney and a witness in her own right should never have been tolerated either. \u201cMills was allowed to sit in on the interview of Clinton as her lawyer. That's absurd. Someone who is supposedly cooperating against the target of an investigation [being] permitted to sit by the target as counsel violates any semblance of ethical responsibility,\u201d the source said. \u201cEvery agent and attorney I have spoken to is embarrassed and has lost total respect for James Comey and Loretta Lynch,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe bar for DOJ is whether the evidence supports a case for charges -- it did here. It should have been taken to the grand jury.\u201d Also infuriating agents, the New York Post reported, was the fact that Clinton\u2019s interview spanned just 3\u00bd hours with no follow-up questioning, despite her \u201c40 bouts of amnesia,\u201d and then, three days later, Comey cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. Many FBI and DOJ staffers believe Comey and Lynch were motivated by ambition, and not justice, the source said. \u201cLoretta Lynch simply wants to stay on as Attorney General under Clinton, so there is no way she would indict,\u201d the source said. \u201cJames Comey thought his position [excoriating Clinton even as he let her off the hook] gave himself cover to remain on as director regardless of who wins.\u201d The decision by Comey and Lynch not to prosecute has renewed FBI agents\u2019 belief that the agency should be autonomous. \u201cThis is why so many agents believe the FBI needs to be an entity by itself to truly be effective,\u201d the senior FBI official told Fox News. \u201cWe all feel very strongly about it -- and the need to be objective. But that truly cannot be done when the AG is appointed by a president and attends daily briefings.\u201d Adding to the controversy, WikiLeaks released internal Clinton communication records this week that show the Department of Justice kept Clinton\u2019s campaign and her staff informed about the progress of its investigation. Leaked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s gmail account show the Clinton campaign was contacted by the DOJ on May 19, 2015. \u201cDOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge\u2019s thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,\u201d Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon wrote in relation to the email documentation the State Department would be required to turn over to the Justice Department. Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, who previously served in the U.S. Treasury Department in the Office of Chief Counsel for the IRS, where he was responsible for litigation in the U.S. Tax Court, said it was clear from the start that the FBI never intended to prosecute. \u201cThis was a fake, false investigation from the outset,\u201d Sekulow said.",

A Memphis professor who left her job under a cloud after a series of racist tweets and Facebook posts has resurfaced at a school across town, where some of her new faculty peers are not happy to have her as a colleague. Zandria Robinson, who taught sociology at University of Memphis until resigning on June 11, had previously posted on Facebook and Twitter that she did not want her daughter attending school with \u201csnotty privileged whites,\u201d apparently ramped up her social media rhetoric after leaving the job. In a series of tweets that began June 26, nine days after white racist Dylann Roof gunned down nine African Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church, Robinson wrote that \u201cwhiteness is most certainly and inevitably terror\u201d and said she expected to see \u201cthinkpieces about how more mental health services could prevent white people from acting how they are conditioned to act.\u201d Officials at Rhodes College announced Robinson's hiring last week, and praised her for her \"provocative\" comments, some of which were first reported by the website\u00a0SoCawlege. \"As a leading scholar and author in the areas of race, class, gender, culture, and the South, Dr. Zandria Robinson\u2019s comments are sometimes provocative, controversial, and debatable,\" the school said in a statement. However, not all professors are in full support of the controversial hiring. Rhodes College Economics Professor John Murray told National Review that the school is trying to counter bad publicity from a year ago, when people posting from on or just off campus wrote racist comments on the anonymous social media app Yik Yak. But he said hiring someone who made racists statements from a different perspective made little sense. \u201cIt does seem kind of crazy that we\u2019re inviting a person to come teach on our faculty who seems to dislike a chunk of our students,\u201d Murray said. University of Memphis spokeswoman Gabrielle Maxey told FoxNews.com Robinson was not fired, despite earlier reports. \"She resigned on June 11,\u201d Maxey said. Robinson has a climactic history of racially-provocative posts on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Robinson could not be reached for comment.",

            "article_content": "Democrats pick up a Senate seat Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois was defeated by Democratic challenger Rep. Tammy Duckworth in a tight race, giving Democrats in the Senate a key pickup Tuesday. Kirk, a moderate Republican who has been critical of presidential Republican nominee Donald Trump, had been seeking a second term. He was identified as one of the Senate\u2019s most endangered Republicans. Kirk brushed off polls that showed him trailing Duckworth. He had a disastrous moment when he questioned Duckworth\u2019s ethnic background. He apologized, but some say the incident did too much damage to his campaign. Duckworth, a veteran, lost both of her legs when a helicopter went down in Iraq. She has said veterans\u2019 issues will form her legislative priorities in the Senate. \"I feel very confident, but I don't take anything for granted which is why I'm still campaigning,\" Duckworth told the local ABC channel before the polls closed. Republicans hold a 54-46 majority in the Senate, including two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats. That means Democrats need to pick up just four seats to take the majority if Clinton wins the White House and can send her vice president to cast tie-breaking votes in a 50-50 Senate. Democrats would need to pick up five seats if Trump wins. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Green Bay won 21-10. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick ignited a social media firestorm Saturday after he refused to stand during the playing of the National Anthem before Friday night\u2019s pre-season game against the Green Bay Packers. In a post-game press conference, Kaepernick explained his reasoning for the overt act of disrespect toward both the American flag and the United States. \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick said after the game. \"To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d Kaepernick appeared to be echoing both a broader condemnation of race relations in the United States as well as a veiled commentary on his apparent belief that the American law enforcement community is engaging in systemic, racially motivated murder. Kaepernick\u2019s comments weren\u2019t just an insult to the over one million Americans -- many thousands of whom were African-American -- who have given their lives in defense of the United States from wars as far back as the American Revolution to the more recent conflicts in the Middle East. Kaepernick also turned his back on the thousands of police officers -- again, a tremendous number of whom were African-American - who have died defending their communities and upholding the rule of law at home. Just this year alone, the number of police officers shot and killed on duty has climbed to 37, a whopping 61 percent higher than at the same point in 2015. The San Francisco 49ers released a statement concerning Kaepernick\u2019s protest, reading in part, \u201cThe national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens.\u201d The 49ers added, \u201cIn respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.\u201d No one should question whether or not Kaepernick had a right to sit, stand, or protest the National Anthem, no matter his motivation. We are blessed to live in a country where an act perceived by most as an ugly display of disrespect is protected by the very system of government prompting the protest. But to what end? Was Kaepernick merely using his status as a public figure to advance a rudimentary talking point about race relations and law enforcement in America? Or was he genuinely interested in trying to be part of a more substantive conversation on a variety of deep social issues? Many celebrities -- and yes, even a back-up quarterback on one of the worst teams in the NFL qualifies as a celebrity nowadays -- use their status within pop culture to advance their beliefs and opinions, often without acknowledging differing perspectives. This is nothing new. But if Colin Kaepernick were truly interested in being a part of the solution -- a meaningful interlocutor offering not just hyperbole but considered rhetoric -- he may have thought to open this dialogue with a sense of mutual understanding and respect and not by boldly thumbing his nose at both the American flag as well as the men and women of all races who have given their lives defending an American ideal -- imperfect in practice, yet exceptional nonetheless -- and one far greater than themselves.",

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from Florida With less than two weeks to go, the race for the White House has narrowed as Hillary Clinton now has a three-point advantage over Donald Trump. That\u2019s within the margin of error of the national Fox News Poll of likely voters. Clinton is ahead of Trump by 44-41 percent. \u00a0Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided. \u00a0Last week she was up by six points (45-39 percent) and before that by seven (45-38 percent). The poll, released Wednesday, finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup. \u00a0That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin. \u00a0She was up 7 a week ago (49-42 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS. Trump is helped by increased backing among independents and greater strength of support: 68 percent of those backing Trump support him \u201cstrongly,\u201d compared to 61 percent for Clinton. Independents favor Trump over Clinton by 13 points (41-28 percent). \u00a0He had a 7-point advantage last week, and two weeks ago they were tied at 35 percent each. \u00a0Third-party candidates play a role here, as Gary Johnson (14 percent) and Jill Stein (7 percent) receive the combined support of more than one-in-five independents. In the four-way race, Trump leads among whites (+14 points) and men (+5), although his best groups remain white evangelical Christians (+56) and whites without a college degree (+28). Clinton has commanding leads among blacks (+77 points), unmarried women (+27), voters under 30 (+18), and women (+10). \u00a0First-time voters are also more likely to back her (+16). The candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful: \u00a083 percent of Democrats back Clinton, while 81 percent of Republicans support Trump. \u201cTo be competitive, Trump needs to consolidate support among Republicans and carry independents,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s made in-roads in the last week, mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and Obamacare.\u201d \u00a0 Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson. Trump\u2019s substantive strength is the economy. \u00a0He\u2019s trusted over Clinton by four points, yet that\u2019s the only issue where he bests her. \u00a0More trust Clinton to handle foreign policy (+15 points), immigration (+3), and terrorism (+3). Who would voters put across the table with Russian President Vladimir Putin? \u00a0More trust Clinton to negotiate with Putin by 3 points (47-44 percent among registered voters). \u00a0That\u2019s down from a 13-point lead on this measure in April (53-40 percent). All in all, likely voters don\u2019t think Trump is up to the task: \u00a0less than half think he\u2019s qualified to be president (46 percent) and even fewer feel he has the temperament to serve effectively (36 percent). \u00a0Plus, over half lack confidence in his judgment in a crisis (56 percent). Clinton trounces Trump on each of those measures: \u00a064 percent believe she\u2019s qualified, 62 percent say she has the temperament, and 56 percent are confident in her judgment. Plus, Clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings. \u00a0She has a net negative rating of eight points (45 favorable vs. 53 unfavorable), while Trump is underwater by 14 (42 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable). \u00a0In addition, when undecided voters and those backing third-party candidates are combined, 26 percent have a favorable view of Clinton vs. 18 percent for Trump. Yet despite Trump\u2019s weaknesses on traits, it\u2019s still a tight race. \u00a0That\u2019s because, at least in part, lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote. \u00a0By a 59-28 percent margin, more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates. \u00a0Those backing Trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57-point margin (73-16 percent). \u00a0For Clinton supporters, the choice is more about issues by 12 points (47-35 percent). Compared to 2008, this is a more character driven election. \u00a0At that time, voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 71-14 percent margin. \"The bottom hasn't fallen out for Trump and Clinton hasn't pulled away, but the race isn\u2019t as close as the 3-point lead suggests,\u201d says Anderson. \u00a0\u201cTrump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of third-party candidates, and that\u2019s extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment, temperament, and qualifications to be president.\" There are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched. \u00a0First, 52 percent feel Clinton \u201cstands up\u201d for people like them, and 49 percent feel that way about Trump. Also on their honesty -- or lack thereof: \u00a0a record-low 30 percent of likely voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 34 percent say Trump is. Pollpourri Here are five additional takeaways from the poll. - 63 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters believe things in the United States generally favor \u201cother people,\u201d rather than people like them. \u00a0Forty-four percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters feel that way. - Twice as many voters expect Clinton to win as think Trump will (64-26 percent). \u00a0Fully 86 percent of Democrats think Clinton will win, while 49 percent of Republicans think Trump will. - Trump supporters (34 percent) are more than three times as likely as Clinton supporters (10 percent) to say they won\u2019t accept the election outcome if their candidate loses. \u00a0Eighty-eight percent of Clinton supporters say they\u2019ll accept the outcome, up from 74 percent in September. - The generic congressional ballot test is also tight: \u00a047 percent back the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, while 45 percent support the Republican. \u00a0Among those backing the GOP congressional candidate, 79 percent go for Trump in the four-way presidential race. \u00a0Clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the Democratic candidate. \u201cModels suggest a 2-point Democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the House and 4 in the Senate,\u201d says Shaw. \u00a0\u201cThat means the GOP would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the House, while the Senate would be very much up for grabs.\u201d - The political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters. \u00a0The Democratic Party has a net positive rating of four points (51 percent favorable vs. 47 percent unfavorable). \u00a0The Republican Party has a net negative rating by just one point (48 percent favorable vs. 49 percent unfavorable). The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-25, 2016.\u00a0 The survey includes results among 1,221 likely voters.\u00a0 The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton discuss Clinton's handling of classified emails, lowering health care costs and the fate of ObamaCare It\u2019s a strange time to be in St. Louis. For the first time since 2010, the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs. The St. Louis Rams are no more, having returned to their Los Angeles past. Maybe strangest of all: the political Shocktoberfest that is the 2016 presidential election, culminating in the second debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the city\u2019s Washington University. Between Friday\u2019s release of the 2005 video laced with Trump vulgarities and the WikiLeaks data dump of Clinton campaign emails and the candidate\u2019s Wall Street speech excerpts, this debate didn\u2019t lack for build-up. To say nothing of morbid curiosity: a pre-debate survey of Washington University students came up with this summation: \u201ca gruesome debate about who is more an enabler of sexual assault.\u201d Sure enough, a question about the video was brought up, right out of the chute, by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Trump admitted embarrassment, but quickly dismissed it as \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d Cooper pushed him on the subject \u2013 was he a groper, did he force himself on women? \u2013 but Trump wouldn\u2019t play along. Clinton, however, did. She questioned Trump\u2019s fitness for the job, then branched out from the video to past Trump comments about immigrants, African-Americans, POW\u2019s and those with disabilities. \u201cThe question our county must answer is this is not who we are.\u201d The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn\u2019t make the trip west. And then it got even more personal. Trump referenced the four women in the audience \u2013 Paula Jones, Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willey \u2013 who\u2019ve accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Did Clinton defend her husband? Actually, she invoked Michelle Obama: \u201cwhen they go low, you go high.\u201d Make of that what you will. Then she belittled Trump for failing to make past apologies, after which Trump upped the ante by promising to sic a special prosecutor against Clinton if he\u2019s elected. Mercifully, after 30 minutes of such rancor, the Average Joes (in the audience and on Facebook) got their turn. The highlights: An American Muslim woman asked Trump about what to do about Islamophobia on the rise. Trump called for the Muslim community to work more closely with law enforcement. Clinton went into a broader talk about defeating ISIS. That segued into one of Clinton\u2019s weaker moments: defending her plan to expand the Syrian refugee population from 10,000 to 65,000. Clinton invoked a bloodied boy, but couldn\u2019t resist trying to bloody Trump as a recruiting tool for ISIS and chumming the waters yet again over his Iraq war position. (Later, both candidates stumbled through the question of what to do about Aleppo \u2013 Trump sounded na\u00efve; Clinton put herself in a box by ruling out ground forces). Then came the question of the WikiLeaks passage in which Clinton supposedly said a politician sometimes needs \u201ca public and a private position\u201d on certain topics. Hillary tried to make it sound Lincolnesque. Equating Wall Street reform in a paid with the fight to abolish slavery? Sounds like a stretch. The closest anyone got to a question on the economy and tax reform? This query directed at Trump: \u201cwhat specific provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\u201d Two complaints about this debate: The overlap between audience and Facebook question led to a lot of talk about Syria and precious little about the country\u2019s tense mood. Race, the Supreme Court, guns and abortion all were pureed into one serving at the 86-minute mark. And the moderators: CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz were more aggressive in policing Trump\u2019s time and parsing his words (Raddatz, in particular, on Aleppo). Must there always be a question of a fair fight? A funny thing about this race: reports of Trump\u2019s political death may be exaggerated. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted immediately after the controversial audio was released gave Clinton a 42%-38% lead over Trump in a four-way race. Previously, it was 41%-39% in her favor. Something else the poll revealed: only 12% of Republicans think Trump should quit the race; 74% think the GOP establishment should continue to back him. The quandary this presents for Republicans: their nominee is wounded, he struggles to crack the 40% barrier; for down-ticket candidates, shunning the nominee risks alienating the GOP base. I give this debate to Trump. He was in better form than the first encounter in Hofstra. This time around, he wasn\u2019t as clunky when defending his record. Unlike the first debate, when he started strong but fell apart, Trump improved as the night went on. Add to that his decision to bring along the Bill Clinton accusers \u2013 the equivalent of Hillary dropping Alicia Machado on Trump at the end of the previous debate \u2013 and Trump had good night in terms of strategy and surpassing expectations. Clinton\u2019s style and presentation were better than Trump\u2019s \u2013 she seemed visibly more comfortable cradling the mike and approaching the audience. But I\u2019m subtracting points from Clinton for this reason: she could have spent more time on the high road, given Trump\u2019s recent travails, but too often she needlessly threw an elbow. In all, it was an evening that will be hard to forget. Trump thinks Clinton should go to jail. Judging by the look on her face, Clinton would like to condemn Trump to a more subterranean existence \u2013 which is funny, since it\u2019s Trump who thinks Hillary is satanic. And here you thought Hell was that debate stage.",

Boggs, an art therapist, served in the U.S. Air Force from 1984 to 1990. (Veteran Artist Program) A taxpayer watchdog group is calling on the Veterans Affairs Administration to showcase work by veteran artists, after it was revealed the VA spent some $20 million on lavish art at facilities around the country. The group,\u00a0Open the Books, released an oversight\u00a0report\u00a0last week on spending at the VA -- showing the administration purchased millions in luxury art at the height of the health care scandal during which thousands of veterans died waiting to see doctors. The $19.7 million tab included a $700,000 sculpture to adorn a California facility for blind veterans. The VA also spent $21,000 for a 27-foot fake Christmas tree; $32,000 for 62 \"local image\" pictures for the San Francisco VA; and $115,600 for \"art consultants\" for the Palo Alto facility. The watchdog group, as well as several U.S. lawmakers, are now calling on the VA to feature the work of their own. \u201cNo one tells the veterans' story better than a\u00a0veteran,\" \u00a0said Adam Andrzejewski, founder and CEO at OpenTheBooks.com. This 60\"x 60\" painting by U.S. Navy veteran Skip Rohde is titled \"Warrior.\" (Veteran Artists Program) \"Veterans themselves should benefit from art displays, not vendors who sell the VA pricey art,\"\u00a0Andrzejewski said in an email Thursday. \"For example, veterans have their own art museum. Why is the VA spending\u00a0millions on lavish art when veterans are already producing great art?\u201d he said. Andrzejewski's group has started a social media campaign on Twitter with the\u00a0hashtag #vetsart4va. Veterans can upload their art and \"show the VA what they\u2019re\u00a0missing,\" he said. Such art can be found by members of the group, Veteran Artists Program, or VAP, a New York City-based nonprofit that takes artists who are also veterans and propels their works and careers into the mainstream creative arts community. VAP covers the performing arts and fine arts -- showcasing many talented painters, sculptors and photographers whose work portrays the struggles and triumphs of America's brave. Shawn\u00a0Ganther, for instance,\u00a0dreamed of becoming an artist prior to serving in the Air Force from 1998 to 2002. \"I want Americans to see soldiers as the heroes who fight and die in the name of freedom -- and to stop and reflect on the privileges they\u00a0sometimes take for granted,\" said Ganther, who served with U.S. security forces in Saudi\u00a0Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. A painting by Ganther titled, \"Retrospective.\" (VAP) Yvette\u00a0Pino,\u00a0an Army veteran, served as a cook from 2002 to 2008. While in Iraq, Pino found a sense of\u00a0solitude in producing artwork and earned the\u00a0unofficial title of \"Division Artist.\" A painting by Pino titled \"Self-Portrait\" (VAP) Veteran Artists Program has previously displayed artwork by veterans at the Pentagon and U.S. Senate office buildings. BR McDonald, founder and president of VAP, said his organization is currently working with at least 10 VA hospitals around the country to feature work by veteran artists. McDonald said spending such money on veteran artists gives them a \"voice to tell their story\" and helps them transition into civilian life. \"The amount of good will that could be spent around this is tremendous,\"\u00a0McDonald said.

            "article_content": "Jan. 9, 2013: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks to reporters in Phoenix, Ariz. (AP) PHOENIX \u2013 The longtime sheriff of metropolitan Phoenix has been charged with criminal contempt-of-court for ignoring a judge's order in a racial-profiling case, leaving the 84-year-old lawman in a tough spot two weeks before Election Day as he seeks a seventh term. The U.S. Department of Justice promised two weeks ago that it would prosecute Sheriff Joe\u00a0Arpaio, but the misdemeanor count wasn't officially filed against him until Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton signed it. Arpaio\u00a0could face up to six months in jail if convicted. A misdemeanor conviction would not bar\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0from serving as sheriff. Democratic challenger Paul Penzone said\u00a0Arpaio, through his acts of political defiance, has no one to blame but himself for the charge. \"It's another example of the sheriff putting his own personal objectives ahead of the best interest of the community at our expense,\" Penzone said. Arpaio\u00a0lawyer Mel McDonald said the sheriff will contest the charge. \"We believe that when the final chapter is written, he will be vindicated,\" McDonald said. McDonald said\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0will not be arrested and no mugshot will be taken. He will plead not guilty in a court filing. The criminal charges stem from the profiling case that\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0lost three years ago that morphed into a contempt case after the sheriff was accused of defying a 2011 court order to stop his signature immigration patrols. Arpaio\u00a0has acknowledged violating U.S. District Judge Murray Snow's order but insists his disobedience was not intentional. Snow disagreed, concluding\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0knowingly continued the patrols because he believed his immigration enforcement efforts would help his 2012 re-election campaign. Arpaio\u00a0ran a TV political ad last week saying the Obama administration's Justice Department planned to prosecute him because of its opposition to his immigration enforcement efforts. In the past,\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0has walked away from criminal investigations without facing charges and still has managed to get re-elected. He faced a federal investigation four years ago on allegations that he retaliated against two local officials and a judge at odds with him by accusing them of corruption. His office also was investigated for misspending more than $100 million in jail funds, including on those failed investigations into rival officials and his traffic patrols targeting immigrants who are in the country illegally. Neither investigation led to prosecution of the sheriff or his employees. County taxpayers have spent $48 million so far to defend\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0and his office in the profiling case. The cost is expected to reach $72 million by next summer. The contempt violation led the judge to order the creation of a taxpayer-funded system for compensating Latinos who were illegally detained when\u00a0Arpaio\u00a0ignored the order. Maricopa County officials have set aside $1 million for funding the system. A Dec. 6 trial has been scheduled in\u00a0Arpaio's\u00a0criminal contempt case.",

Marimar Quiora once hid her face from strangers in the street, but now proudly bares her beauty to millions of people who follow her online. Marimar was born with a facial tumour called cystic hygroma, which means she has to use sign language in her videos to communicate. But the inspirational student won?t let anything hold her back, and now she is turning traditional beauty standards on their head with her powerful message of self-love.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH BY Barcroft Images\n\nLondon-T:+44 207 033 1031 E:hello@barcroftmedia.com -\nNew York-T:+1 212 796 2458 E:hello@barcroftusa.com -\nNew Delhi-T:+91 11 4053 2429 E:hello@barcroftindia.com www.barcroftimages.com (Barcroft Media) A California woman who once hid from strangers because of her large facial tumor is now a popular makeup blogger and Zumba instructor. Marimar Quiora, 21, was born with a cystic hygroma, a type of birth defect that typically grows as the child does, Barcroft Media reported. While the abnormal tissue can be removed, if complete removal isn\u2019t possible, the tumor commonly returns, according to MedlinePlus. Quiora has undergone multiple procedures in attempts to reduce the tumor which has left her unable to speak. She is also forced to breathe through a hole in her throat, eat through a tube in her stomach and the hearing in her right ear is diminished. Now, she\u2019s focusing on embracing her beauty and encourages others to do the same, Barcroft reported. \u201cWhen I was younger I would talk to myself in the mirror. I would tell myself I was beautiful,\u201d Quiora told Barcroft. \u201c\u201dWhat I like about makeup and beauty is imagining new looks, especially around the eyes, and showing people they\u2019re beautiful no matter what.\u201d Two years ago, Quiora started a video blog on Youtube, sharing makeup tutorials and communicating through sign language. She\u2019s gained over 9 million views and, while she\u2019s received positive comments, has had to deal with the negative, as well. \u201cWhen people say negative things to me, I either tell them to stop it or just ignore them,\u201d she told Barcroft. \u201cBut if people are staring at me, I stare right back and refuse to look away until they stop.\u201d Quiora is training to teach deaf children and attends beauty school in the evening.

Flanagan, who had been an employee at WDBJ and appeared on air as Bryce Williams, posted his own video of the attack on his social media accounts after fleeing the scene. (Twitter via AP) (The Associated Press) Long before he filmed himself shooting and killing a TV reporter and cameraman during a live news broadcast Wednesday, the man identified as the suspect followed a twisted and volatile career path that saw him fired from at least two stations for conflicts with co-workers, leaving colleagues with memories of an \"off-kilter\" loner easily angered by office humor. When the suspect, identified by authorities as Vester Lee Flanagan II, was fired from Roanoke, Va., station WDBJ in 2013, he had to be escorted out of the building by local police \"because he was not going to leave willingly or under his own free will,\" the station's former news director, Dan Dennison, said in an interview with a Hawaii station, Hawaii News Now (KHNL/KGMB). Flanagan, 41, had \"a long series of complaints against co-workers nearly from the beginning of employment at the TV station,\" said Dennison, now an official with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. \"All of these allegations were deemed to be unfounded. And they were largely under along racial lines, and we did a thorough investigation and could find no evidence that anyone had racially discriminated against this man.\" The victims of Wednesday's shooting were white; Flanagan was black. Hours after he allegedly shot his former co-workers Wednesday, Flanagan crashed a vehicle and troopers found him suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He died at a hospital later Wednesday, authorities said. The conflict described by Dennison in many ways echoed another, in 2000, when Flanagan was fired from a north Florida television station in 2000 after threatening fellow employees, a former supervisor said. Flanagan \"was a good on-air performer, a pretty good reporter and then things started getting a little strange with him,\" Don Shafer, the former news director of Florida's WTWC-TV said Wednesday in an interview broadcast on Shafer's current employer, San Diego 6 The CW. Shafer said managers at the Florida station fired Flanagan because of his \"bizarre behavior.\" \"He threatened to punch people out and he was kind of running fairly roughshod over other people in the newsroom,\" said Shafer, who did not immediately return a call for comment. In 2000, Flanagan sued the Florida station over allegations of race discrimination, claiming that a producer called him a \"monkey\" in 1999 and that other black employees had been called the same name by other workers. Flanagan also claimed that an unnamed white supervisor at the station said black people were lazy because they did not take advantage of scholarships to attend college. The parties later reached a settlement. Before and after his work in Florida, Flanagan, who also appeared on-air using the name Bryce Williams, worked at a series of stations around the country, sometimes for just a few months at a time. They included a stint in 1996 at KPIX, a San Francisco station, where a spokeswoman confirmed he worked as freelance production assistant. From 2002 to 2004, he worked as a reporter and anchor at WNCT-TV in Greensboro, N.C., general manager and vice president John Lewis said. Neither knew or worked with Flanagan and said they could not answer questions about his departure from jobs at their stations. But in a rambling letter to family, friends and authorities that was sent to ABC News, Flanagan listed a long list of grievances, dating back to the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech and the more recent massacre of worshippers at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. \"I've been a human powder keg for a while,\" Flanagan wrote in the note, \"just waiting to go BOOM!!!!\"",

Fricke said he wants a candidate who will fight to lower taxes and ensure a strong military to protect the country. (AP Photo/Grant Schulte) (The Associated Press) Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks at a campaign rally, Tuesday, May 10, 2016, in Stockton, Calif.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) (The Associated Press) Voters in West Virginia and Nebraska are casting primary ballots on Tuesday, but the only competitive presidential race that remains in the Democratic contest in West Virginia. With Nebraska's Democrats having caucused in March \u2014 giving Bernie Sanders a comfortable win over Hillary Clinton \u2014 the state's Republicans went to the polls Tuesday with their party's presidential race all but sewn up by businessman Donald Trump. Voters must decide several other races, though. In West Virginia, the headline race is between Clinton and Sanders, with Trump having cleared the GOP field of rivals in Indiana last week. West Virginians are also voting in a Democratic showdown for governor, a state Supreme Court race and other contests. Here are some voters' thoughts: Don Fricke, a 76-year-old dentist from Lincoln, Nebraska, said he voted for Trump because he's a political outsider. Fricke said he wants a candidate who will work to lower taxes and defend the country by strengthening the military, and he sees those qualities in Trump. \"He's got enough guts to change things in Washington so they don't keep doing things the way they've been doing them,\" Fricke said. \"Obviously the others have dropped out now. I think one of the others, Cruz or Rubio, would have been OK too.\" Fricke said he thinks Trump has \"a very good chance\" against Clinton in the general election. \"Hillary's got too much baggage,\" Fricke said. ___ Joe Jensen, 63, of Lincoln, said he voted for Ted Cruz over Trump even though Cruz dropped out last week because he sees the senator from Texas as more trustworthy and a reliable social conservative. \"I still haven't made up my mind yet if I can vote for Trump in the general election,\" Jensen said outside his polling place at Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church. \"He's a liar. He changes his opinions. I believe he's really a Democrat dressed in Republican clothes. I'd only vote for him because Hillary is even worse.\" Jensen, an evangelical Christian, said he sees Cruz as \"a believer in the Constitution\" who fervently opposes abortion. He said he also liked Marco Rubio and John Kasich. On the timing of Nebraska's primary, he said: \"I wish we had been before Indiana. But I guess I don't mind it. Since we're late, we didn't have to listen to all of the ads.\" ___ Democrat Joe Hall, a highway engineer from Alum Creek, West Virginia, said he voted for Sanders instead of Clinton. Like some others who cast ballots Tuesday, he said he felt like he was \"voting for the lesser of two evils.\" Hall, 55, was critical of Clinton's use of private emails while she was secretary of state and her response to the September 2012 attacks on a diplomatic compound that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Hall said he doesn't agree with all of Sanders' stances, including Sanders' support for abortion rights. But he said he likes Sanders' economic ideas. \"He's not a perfect candidate to me,\" Hall said. \"I just can't vote for Hillary.\" ___ Chris Wilder has worked for nine years as an electrician doing repair work at coal mines in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and now, West Virginia. After voting for Trump on Tuesday in Madison, the 30-year-old said \"we need someone in there that supports coal.\" Wilder said he received a layoff notice last week that was later postponed, allowing him to work this week. But he said his future is unknown. \"My job's hanging in the balance right now,\" he said. \"I've thought about leaving the state.\" Thousands of miners in central Appalachia have received layoffs notices in the past year. At campaign rallies, Trump has promised to help coal miners. Wilder said that \"everything he says he's going to do, I'd like to see him do. We really need somebody in here for coal. We need coal back. We need jobs. I think that's the best choice.\" ___ Hours after taking an advanced placement government exam, Hurricane High School student Tevin Robinson voted for the first time at an elementary school in nearby Scott Depot, West Virginia. The 18-year-old, who plans to study economics at Columbia University, voted for Clinton saying he doesn't like Sanders' proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. He says he wants a higher minimum wage, but not that high. Robinson says that economically, Clinton \"has a more stable plan than her counterparts. I believe that she has the ability and the background to take the president to a better level than it has been before.\" ___ Anne and Jim Ashley, of Scott Depot, said they voted for Trump after initially backing Ted Cruz for the Republican nomination. Anne Ashley, a 66-year-old substitute teacher's aide, said she thinks Trump has some good ideas for the country. \"I think he is becoming more aware of the gravity of becoming president and becoming more composed.\" Her husband, a retired telephone company worker, said he believes Trump will help create jobs. He said it's important for Trump to unify the Republican Party and to bring other candidates that ran against him into the fold. \"He thinks 'I can do it on my own,' but he's wrong,\" Jim Ashley said. \"He's got to bring the party together. He talks about 'I don't really need them.' Well yes, he does need them.\" ___ Democrat Christopher Blackmon, a 31-year-old social worker from Charleston, West Virginia, said he is voting for Clinton because he thinks her views are more realistic. \"With all the politicians and everybody that's running, to be honest, I don't believe with everything that they all say,\" Blackmon said. \"But when you have this choice, it's one of those things where you've got to pick the lesser of the evils, in a sense.\" He said Bernie Sanders is almost trying to make everything like the \"Garden of Eden.\" \"I think Bernie, in a sense, he wants a Utopia-type thing for America with a lot of his views,\" Blackmon said. \"And I don't think that's realistic. I don't think that's going to happen.\" ___ Dave George, 47, said he voted for Cruz in Lincoln, Nebraska, even though Trump has effectively won the nomination. George said he wanted to make a statement against Trump with his vote. \"The man's a pig,\" George said outside his polling place at the Belmont Recreation Center in Lincoln. \"He's a terrible human being. He's a megalomaniac, and I'm absolutely astonished he's made it to this point.\" George said he was \"incredibly\" frustrated that the GOP primary was over by the time Nebraska's election arrived. He said he feels that moderate voices are being overshadowed, and he plans to vote for a write-in or third-party candidate in November. \"The only candidate still in the campaign is Trump, and he's a caricature,\" George said. \"This is ridiculous.\" ___ Vicki Baines, who voted at Covenant Presbyterian Church in west Omaha, said she didn't feel great about her options in the presidential race because her favorite GOP candidates weren't even on the ballot. \"The people I related to didn't even make it to the top four,\" said Baines who didn't name her favorites. Baines, 62, joked that she wrote in a fictional character for president that she could trust. \"I'm sticking with my man Pinocchio,\" she said. ___ Dorothy Burford, an 81-year-old retiree from Charleston, West Virginia, is a registered Democrat who says she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2008. This year, she left the Democratic race for president empty because she wants to vote for Donald Trump in the fall. She said the change dealt with how she thinks the candidates view the coal industry. \"I think Hillary was against the coal miners,\" Burford said. \"I think Trump has a better view on how we can get the coal miners back to work.\" ___ The following Associated Press writers contributed to this report: Josh Funk in Omaha, Neb.; Grant Schulte in Lincoln, Neb.; Jonathan Mattise in Charleston, W.Va.; John Raby in Cross Lanes, W.Va.; and Claire Galofaro in Logan, W.Va.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, is accompanied by his running mate, Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, during a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday October 22, 2016. (AP Photo / Evan Vucci) Here\u2019s the astonishing truth the media\u2019s not talking about and Democrats refuse to believe \u2014 Donald Trump is getting more than double, and sometimes more than triple, the black vote Romney got 4 years ago. Recent polling by Remington Research shows Trump getting 22% in Florida, Romney got 5 percent. In North Carolina, Trump\u2019s getting 19%, Romney got 4 percent.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s getting 22% of black voters in Wisconsin compared with Romney\u2019s 6% 4 years ago.\u00a0 And in Pennsylvania, Trump scores an astounding 29% against Romney\u2019s 7% share in 2012. Nationally, Romney received less than 7% of the black vote in 2012.\u00a0 Even Trump\u2019s worst numbers among African-Americans show him getting 19%, and some polls show him doing much better. Even more exciting for Republican prospects, increasing black support is not confined to Trump.\u00a0 In Wisconsin, Ron Johnson has pulled even in his race for re-election to the U.S. Senate thanks largely to black defection from the Democrat party.\u00a0 A CNN poll shows Rob Portman getting 32% of non-white voters in Ohio, mostly African Americans.\u00a0 In North Carolina, a Quinnipiac Poll shows Richard Burr gets 24% of the ethnic vote, most of them African Americans. Generally, there are three reasons African-Americans are voting in record numbers for Republicans this year. First, for the first time since anyone can remember, Republicans have broken the communications monopoly Democrats have enjoyed among African-Americans. Trump is persistently reaching out to them; visiting their churches and neighborhoods, making a commitment to rebuild America\u2019s cities, economy and jobs. Second, Trump\u2019s not the only one speaking to African Americans. The organization I am honored to Chair, the 2016 Committee \u2014 best known for our successful effort to draft Dr. Ben Carson into the presidential race \u2014 has, in the last three months, raised and spent more than $1.3 million in 6 battleground states on radio ads targeted to African American voters.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s an ad effort focused on Trump, but providing real value for Republicans down-ticket as well. Our ad campaign is based on concrete test data. In fact, the predecessor to The 2016 Committee, the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, ran a test of this approach in the North Carolina Senate race two years ago which pit incumbent Kay Hagen against challenger Thom Tillis. We ran radio ads for 8 weeks in that part of North Carolina where just under two-thirds of African Americans live.\u00a0 Radio ads were not run in the northern tier of the state on the Virginia border, nor in the southern crescent adjacent to the South Carolina border. Rasmussen polling before the ads started showed that Kay Hagen was winning 99% of the African American vote -- about the same support she received in 2008 with Barack Obama at the top of the ticket.\u00a0 A few weeks after the ads started running polls indicated a notable shift in black voter preference. On election day, exit polls taken by Rasmussen showed Thom Tillis received 11.9% of the African-American vote statewide.\u00a0 This is clearly a result of the more than $300,000 worth of radio ads run by the Committee. As further validation, Tillis received precisely the result you\u2019d expect if he won 1% of the black vote where the ads did not run and 18% in the areas where ads could be heard. The third and most significant reason for the shift in African- American voter preferences this year is African-Americans have grown weary of shopworn liberal policies aimed at buying black votes while limiting black opportunity and prosperity. Hillary promises to double down on those failed policies. The 2016 Committee\u2019s radio ads make the case with examples from three broad issue areas:\u00a0 education, jobs and abortion. Our ads show how Hillary\u2019s unconditional support for teachers\u2019 unions and opposition to charter schools condemn poor children to continuing poverty. We discuss Hillary\u2019s support for higher taxes, more regulation and bigger government \u2014 the liberal trifecta that restricts minorities to the economic hole leftist policies have anchored them in, prohibits job growth in the private sector, and guarantees deteriorating living conditions. And we point out that despite boasting of her work for kids, she defends abortion in horrifically painful ways right up to the last hour even though one of three babies aborted in America is black.\u00a0 How can she take for granted black votes when she isn\u2019t interested in protecting the lives of black babies? Those who claim a Trump win depends entirely on his running the board with white voters are missing a historic shift in party alignment that will profoundly impact American politics. Given the growing desperation of minorities victimized by liberal policies for the last 6 decades, it can\u2019t happen soon enough.",

            "article_content": "GOP presumptive nominee has 45-42 percent edge in hypothetical head-to-head matchup Donald Trump tops Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, according to a new Fox News Poll that also finds majorities of voters feel both frontrunners lack strong moral values and will say anything to get elected. Trump has a 45-42 percent edge over Clinton, if the presidential election were held today.\u00a0 That\u2019s within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error.\u00a0 Last month, Clinton was up by 48-41 percent (April 2016). Clinton is ahead by 14 points among women (50-36 percent).\u00a0 Yet Trump leads by a larger 22 points among men (55-33 percent). He also tops Clinton by 37 points (61-24 percent) among whites without a college degree (working-class whites). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Overall, Trump is preferred by 24 points among whites (55-31 percent).\u00a0 He\u2019s even ahead by nine among white women (47-38 percent). Clinton has a commanding 83-point lead among blacks (90-7 percent), and is up by 39 among Hispanics (62-23 percent). The poll includes an oversample of additional interviews among Hispanics/Latinos nationally.\u00a0 Watch for more on those results Friday on FoxNewsLatino.com. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won by 20 points among whites, while President Barack Obama won blacks by 87 points and Hispanics by 44, according to the Fox News exit poll. One reason for Trump\u2019s showing is there is parity on party unity, as 83 percent of Democrats back Clinton and 82 percent of Republicans support Trump. Independents go for Trump by 46-30 percent, although one in five would vote for someone else or stay home (20 percent). Enthusiasm is on the GOP\u2019s side, as more Republicans (74 percent) than Democrats (66 percent) say they are extremely or very interested in the presidential election. The poll shows Bernie Sanders has a 46-42 percent advantage over Trump in a hypothetical matchup.\u00a0 Sanders was up by 53-39 percent in April.\u00a0 However, the Vermont senator trails Clinton in the Democratic nomination race by what is considered an insurmountable number of delegates. The drawn-out nomination battle may hurt Clinton among the base, as 1 in 10 Sanders voters say they would pick Trump over her in November (11 percent). Candidate Characteristics Clinton and Trump have made quite an impression so far.\u00a0 Overall, voters feel the candidates lack honesty, empathy, and strong moral values, and that they\u2019ll say anything to win. Clinton has a net negative honesty rating of -35 points.\u00a0 That\u2019s because a new low 31 percent say she\u2019s honest, while a record 66 percent say she isn\u2019t. Trump does better on this measure, although he is still underwater by 17 points:\u00a0 40 percent think he\u2019s honest and 57 percent say he\u2019s not. In addition, over half say the phrase \u201chas strong moral values\u201d does not describe Clinton (57 percent) or Trump (58 percent). Many think \u201ccares about people like me\u201d doesn\u2019t fit Trump (55 percent). More voters than not think the \u201ccares\u201d attribute doesn\u2019t work for Clinton either (46 percent yes vs. 51 percent no). Clinton performs best on \u201cis a strong leader,\u201d although the reviews are mixed: 49 percent say it applies to her, while 50 percent say it doesn\u2019t. \u201cStrong leader\u201d is also Trump\u2019s best trait, as 59 percent feel it describes him (38 percent disagree). Even so, half or better say \u201cis a reliable leader\u201d doesn\u2019t describe Clinton (55 percent) or Trump (50 percent). Most think Clinton (71 percent) and Trump (65 percent) will \u201csay anything to get elected.\u201d\u00a0 And majorities think the main reason the former secretary of state (57 percent) and businessman (56 percent) are running is for themselves -- rather than for the country. Who is more corrupt?\u00a0 By a 49-37 percent margin, voters give that dubious distinction to Clinton. Pollpourri What about former Republican governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson, who is favored to top the Libertarian Party ticket?\u00a0 He ran in 2012 and received almost one percent of the vote nationally. The poll finds Johnson garners 10 percent in this hypothetical three-way matchup.\u00a0 But that wouldn\u2019t change the race, as Trump still holds the edge over Clinton:\u00a0 42-39 percent. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,021 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from May 14-17, 2016.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Open carry is permitted for legally-owned guns under Ohio law Members of the controversial \"black power\" group the New Black Panther Party plan to pack legal heat when they hold rallies in Cleveland in conjunction with next week's Republican convention if the law allows, the group's chairman said. Leaders of the organization, which the Southern Poverty Law Center designates as a hate group, told Reuters that if Ohio's open-carry gun laws allow, its members will bring guns for self-defense. Cleveland police are preparing for mass demonstrations, and word that the New Black Panthers may be armed could complicate preparations. \"If it is an open state to carry, we will exercise our Second Amendment rights because there are other groups threatening to be there that are threatening to do harm to us,\" Hashim Nzinga, chairman of the New Black Panther Party, told Reuters. Officials told Reuters it will be legal for protesters to carry registered weapons at demonstrations outside the convention under that state's \"open carry\" law, which allows civilians to carry guns in public. The state requires permits for concealed handguns, but not for openly displayed guns. Stephen Loomis, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, told The New York Times he is urging people not to bring guns near the convention. \u201cThe last thing in the world we need is anybody walking around here with AR-15s strapped to their back,\u201d Loomis said. In last week's sniper attack in which a lone gunman killed five Dallas police officers during a Black Lives Matter protest against police brutality, cops said they were initially confused as to where the gunfire was coming from because some demonstrators were legally carrying rifles. The killer, Micah Johnson, was an Army veteran who, before he was blown up by a police robot, said he wanted to kill white people and white police officers. New Black Panther Party leader Quanell X said Johnson had worked with his Houston chapter until a few years ago, when he was allegedly dismissed for calling for violence. Nzinga said he condemned the Dallas shootings. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes the New Black Panther Party as \u201ca virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.\"",

            "article_content": "Epstein, (l.), and Clinton, (r.), flew dozens of times on the billionaire's jet, dubbed \"The Lolita Express.\" Attorneys for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein touted his close friendship with Bill Clinton and even claimed the billionaire helped start Clinton's controversial family foundation in a 2007 letter aimed at boosting his image during plea negotiations, FoxNews.com has learned. The 23-page letter, written by high-powered lawyers Alan Dershowitz and Gerald Lefcourt, was apparently part of an ultimately successful bid to negotiate a plea deal before Epstein could be tried for using underage girls in a sex ring based in Palm Beach, Fla., and his private island estate\u00a0on the 72-acre Virgin Islands home dubbed \u201cOrgy Island.\u201d\u00a0Epstein spent 13 months in prison and home detention after agreeing to a plea deal\u00a0in which he admitted to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. \"Mr. Epstein was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is described as a project 'bringing together a community of global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges,\u201d read the July 2007 letter to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Florida. \u201cFocuses of this initiative include poverty, climate change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts.\u201d (Excerpt from letter Epstein's lawyers sent to federal prosecutors while negotiating plea deal.) The hedge fund magnate\u2019s true role in creating the foundation could not be confirmed. Whether Epstein was an actual founder of the foundation or exaggerated his role in a phony effort to appear altruistic is not clear. Epstein is not cited in official paperwork filed by the Clinton Global Initiative as a founder or director. Neither The Clinton Foundation nor Dershowitz responded to FoxNews.com\u2019s inquiry as to the extent of Epstein\u2019s involvement.\u00a0FoxNews.com first reported that flight logs show the former president flew on Epstein\u2019s private plane\u00a0dozens of times. But Clinton has publicly credited longtime assistant Doug Band, now counselor and director of the foundation, as conceiving of the idea. The foundation has raised hundreds of millions of dollars, ostensibly for charitable works in places such as Haiti and Africa. But questions have arisen about how much of the donations actually went to aiding the poor, and critics have accused the Clintons of using it as a slush fund. Flight logs show Clinton flew on Epstein's private jet dozens of times Attorneys describe the foundation, which has undergone name changes since its formation in 2005, as designed \u201cto convene world leaders, forward-looking CEOs, and philanthropists to commit to take action on pressing global challenges.\u201d In an effort to emphasize Epstein\u2019s close ties to Clinton before he was sentenced, his lawyers also credited Epstein with \"hosting\" a trip to Africa in 2002 on his private Boeing 727 for the Clinton Global Initiative, which Clinton himself attended, along with actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Chris Tucker, and other celebrities, purportedly for an anti-AIDS and economic-development mission. \"In a feature article about Mr. Epstein in New Yorker magazine, former President Clinton aptly described Mr. Epstein as a 'committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of 21st century science,'\u201d Epstein\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cPresident Clinton reached this conclusion during a monthlong trip to Africa with Mr. Epstein, which Mr. Epstein hosted. The purpose of that trip was to increase AIDS awareness; to work toward a solution to the AIDS crisis; and to provide funding to reduce the costs of delivering medications to those inflicted with the disease.\" Epstein also has supported the Clinton Foundation financially, but that was not made public until two years ago when a whistle-blower released the names of the super-rich, including Epstein, who held Swiss accounts at the HSBC bank. Epstein's private getaway has been dubbed \"Orgy Island.\" (Google Earth images) The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained the data from the whistle-blower, documented $81 million being routed from HSBC Swiss accounts to The Clinton Foundation, including money from Epstein. Epstein had various accounts totaling $3.5 million, the investigative journalists group revealed and, in 2006, directed $25,000 to The Clinton Foundation. The close association between Epstein and Clinton is just one example of their personal and professional ties running much deeper than previously made public. A FoxNews.com investigation in May showed the former president was a frequent flier on Epstein\u2019s infamous jet, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express,\u201d which earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. Flight logs obtained exclusively by FoxNews.com show the former president taking at least 26 trips around the world aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights. Epstein and his attorneys have said in multiple court filings that he has been the subject of the \u201cmost outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.\u201d However, hundreds of pages of court records, including reports from law enforcement, reviewed by FoxNews.com, show Epstein was under close scrutiny by the Palm Beach police and FBI for more than a year. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up. On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators. In a highly unusual civil lawsuit, Florida attorney Brad Edwards, and Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who represented some of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, are suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned, so that Epstein could potentially face additional criminal charges.",

The assignment was for a Literature Composition class at Aloha High School, KATU reported Thursday. Students responded to statements including, \u201cI can be in the company of people of my race most of the time,\u201d \u201cI can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me\u201d and \u201cI am never asked to speak for all the people in my racial group,\u201d scoring them on how often they felt the ideas were true. \u201cI think he should be learning actual education and not be a part of some social experiment or some teacher\u2019s political agenda,\u201d commented Jason Schmidt, whose son is in the class. \u201cWith the amount of money we pay for schools, they should be educating, not indoctrinating our students about the latest political fad or political agenda a teacher wants to get across,\u201d Schmidt added. School officials were quick to defend the assignment. \u201cThe survey is just one activity that engages students in exploring this area,\u201d Maureen Wheeler, the Beaverton School District spokeswoman, told NWCN. She said the class was meant for students to explore social issues, specifically in relation to race, class and sexuality, with the aim of having students \u201cgain empathy, understanding and to build bridges.\u201d Some parents agreed with the school district. \u201cI want [my daughter] to have opinions. Whether it\u2019s for or against, you have to create those, but you can\u2019t without good information so I applaud teachers getting out that information,\u201d parent Sarah Rios-Lopez responded. Just west of downtown Portland, Aloha County is 79 percent white, a 2000 census report found. The school itself is 47 percent white and 34 percent Hispanic, according to the school district.",

(AP Photo/California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation) SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 Nearly 15 hours after a riot at a Northern California prison, guards found a missing inmate sawed nearly in two, with his abdominal organs and most chest organs removed, his body folded and stuffed into a garbage can in a shower stall a few doors from his cell. Details of the gruesome May killing at the medium-security California State Prison, Solano, are laid out in an autopsy report obtained by The Associated Press under a public records request. The grisly discovery raises obvious questions about the prison's security: How could such a gruesome killing happen inside a locked facility with security and surveillance? How could someone obtain weapons sharp enough to dissect a body? And why did it take so long to uncover? Homicides are distressingly common in California prisons. More than 160 inmates have been killed in the last 15 years, and the state has one of the nation's highest inmate homicide rates. Yet the death of 24-year-old Nicholas Anthony Rodriguez stands out. Rodriguez's missing organs are \"still part of the investigation\" at the prison in Vacaville, 40 miles southwest of Sacramento, Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton said Friday. No one has been charged with killing Rodriguez, an Oakland man who was serving an eight-year robbery sentence from Alameda County. However, Thornton said his cellmate, a 46-year-old man serving a life sentence for a Los Angeles County murder, is considered the only suspect and is being held in segregation. Thornton said she couldn't say how the homicide was carried out or concealed since it's still being investigated. \"It just blows my mind, because officers are looking in on inmates all the time,\" said Christine Ward, executive director of the Crime Victims Action Alliance. \"Unfortunately, we know that there are drugs, there's alcohol, there are weapons. As much as the officers can police that, we know we've got the toughest, the baddest, the most violent criminals in our state prison and unfortunately some of the most cunning prisoners in there as well. They are going to find ways to do that.\" Rodriguez's body was discovered around 9:30 p.m. May 4, 14\u00bd hours after inmates were ordered locked in their cells following a brawl between 58 inmates in his housing unit. Three prisoners and one correctional officer were injured in the fight, and Thornton said an inmate-made weapon was recovered. She declined to describe it. Despite the riot and resulting investigation, Rodriguez was not discovered missing until a head count at 4:30 p.m. Thornton said officials initially assumed he had escaped. Investigators are looking into whether the riot was created to conceal the slaying or allow someone to move the body. \"It's very difficult to cover every contingency with the limited staff that we have,\" said Chuck Alexander, president of the California Correctional Peace Officers Association that represents most prison guards. \"This kind of thing at Solano, sad to say I predict it's just a precursor,\" he said. He noted a 2011 California law that keeps lower-level offenders in county jails, leaving state prisons to hold the most violent criminals. Changes in prison policies, meanwhile, mean more dangerous offenders are being housed in lower-security prisons like medium-security. Rodriguez had alcohol in his system and was dead before he was eviscerated, killed by blows to the head that left him with a deep star-shaped wound on his forehead among his multiple skull fractures, cuts and other wounds, according to the May 27 autopsy report conducted by the Solano County Sheriff coroner's office. His mother, Maria Rodriguez of Oakland, said she has been given no details about what happened. She said she had not seen the autopsy report but said that she knew her son's body was badly injured. \"When I saw my son ... at the funeral, he was so bad in the face,\" she said in a telephone interview. \"I called them last week, and they say they're going to tell me in two weeks or in three weeks, but right now we don't got nothing.\"",

            "article_content": "2016 candidate weighs in on how he can play spoiler in the two party race In a confounding election season where voters hold deep reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees, the third-party Libertarian ticket has a rare chance this year to be more than a footnote in the presidential race. And that chance \u2013 to absorb disaffected voters who have little interest in picking \u2018Trump\u2019 or \u2018Clinton\u2019 this November \u2013 is raising the stakes for the national convention starting Friday where activists with the oft-sidelined movement will choose their nominee. \u201cThere is a huge opportunity in this election cycle,\u201d Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told FoxNews.com. Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination, has been enjoying the spotlight lately as at least two recent polls have put him in double digits in a three-way race against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. One Fox News poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two titans \u2013 not exactly in contention, but nevertheless impressive for a party that\u2019s never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election. Whether Johnson\u2019s numbers reflect growth among libertarians or simply a none-of-the-above choice, the candidate acknowledged in an interview with FoxNews.com, \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of both.\u201d But, presuming he can snag the nod at the Memorial Day weekend convention, which starts Friday and wraps up Monday in Orlando, Johnson indicated he\u2019ll happily fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative at a time when some voters are seeking out a third-party option. Delegates will nominate a candidate Sunday. \u201cThe nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states,\u201d he said. \u201cI jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [the] third name in any polls, the recognizable figure that he is, [he] would be at 30 percent. But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states.\u201d While prominent conservatives have floated the idea of a new third party, state ballot access will indeed be a challenge. As Johnson says, the Libertarian Party \u2013 already on 32 state ballots \u2013 will likely be on all 50 state ballots by November. Upping his potential appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans, Johnson tapped another former GOP governor, William Weld of Massachusetts, to be his running mate, both fiscal conservatives and social liberals. \u201cIf conservative means smaller government, I think we are the proven commodity,\u201d Johnson said. He is still short of the needed 15 percent to qualify for the presidential debates. But he believes if he\u2019s in the debates, the ticket could collect electoral votes. \u201cI would not be doing this if there wasn\u2019t the opportunity to actually win,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNew Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, there are some real opportunities.\u201d The 15 percent debate threshold may be reachable. His standing in the Fox News poll was consistent with a Monmouth University poll in March that showed him at 11 percent. If the numbers hold, Johnson would far exceed third-party candidate Ralph Nader\u2019s 3 percent in 2000, but still lag behind Ross Perot\u2019s 19 percent in 1992. Johnson\u2019s optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history. Not only does the party have a poor track record in general elections, but Johnson\u2019s poll numbers haven\u2019t always held up either. In the 2012 general election \u2013 when Johnson initially ran as a Republican and later as a Libertarian -- he polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up getting less than 1 percent of the popular vote. Still, the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian, and if the party can build on that this year, it could be enough to at least influence the outcome in November \u2013 though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen. Sarwark suggested they\u2019ll pull from both sides. \u201cA group of Republicans feel their party\u2019s nomination was stolen from them by a reality TV star. A group of Democrats that supported Bernie Sanders don\u2019t want to support a war hawk, who supports the racist war on drugs and has been a corporate shill,\u201d he said. Last week, Weld made waves by comparing Trump\u2019s deportation policy to Nazi tactics. But Johnson said they were not holding back on Clinton either, and are reaching out to disaffected Sanders supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that if Hillary is elected, government is going to expand. With regard to military and foreign policy, she has been an architect,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIs anything going to change with regards to foreign policy? No.\u201d There could still be some drama this weekend. About 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando. The top contenders are Johnson, anti-virus software developer John McAfee and libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen, and 15 other candidates. \u201cIf Johnson does not win on the first round, it will be mine,\u201d McAfee told FoxNews.com in an email. Johnson likely isn\u2019t guaranteed a first ballot victory, said William Irwin, the chairman of the philosophy department at King\u2019s College, who has written books on libertarianism, most recently \u201cFree Dakota.\u201d \u201cSome predicted the libertarian moment has passed. I think the libertarian moment is now,\u201d Irwin told FoxNews.com. \u201cBut just like there are Never-Trump and Never-Hillary voters, there are some libertarians who are Never-Johnson. He was sort of an accidental Libertarian who came to the party after he couldn\u2019t get into the [2012] Republican primary debates.\u201d Johnson, if nominated, could run into trouble with some conservatives \u2013 yet attract liberals \u2013 as a supporter of abortion rights and marijuana legalization. He also favors military cuts and a reserved foreign policy, while backing sweeping entitlement reforms, changes to the tax code and term limits for members of Congress. Johnson and Weld, both two-term governors in the 1990s, were given A\u2019s in the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s Fiscal Policy Report Card for cutting spending and taxes. \u201cTwo governors running against a candidate that has never held office and another who has not held executive office -- the Libertarians would be the most experienced ticket,\u201d Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz told FoxNews.com. He added, \u201cBut this year, experience isn\u2019t what people are looking for.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Retailer releases a statement addressing transgender guests and employees The American Family Association is praising Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton for urging Target to re-examine its controversial transgender bathroom policies after a second man was caught recording women undressing in changing rooms. \"After this latest incident, I hope Target finally recognizes the importance of protecting its customers, especially in environments where they can be at their most vulnerable. I am offering them the resources of my office to help assist them in improving their safety procedures,\"\u00a0Paxton said\u00a0in a message to Target last Friday. Paxton was referring to police reports searching for a man who peered over a changing room wall with a cellphone at a Target\u00a0store\u00a0on Northwest Highway at Abrams. It is the second such incident reported, after a similar crime occurred back in May at a Target\u00a0store\u00a0in Frisco, Texas. AFA, a conservative group that has lead a\u00a0nationwide boycott\u00a0against Target for allowing men to go into women's bathrooms and dressing rooms if they identify as female,\u00a0praised Paxton's inquiry, arguing that he is taking a \"courageous stand against Target's unsafe and dangerous policy.\" \"And he's not afraid to step on some corporate toes to make sure companies don't put women and children at risk from sexual predators,\" the group added in a statement on Tuesday. The AFA noted that Paxton sent a similar letter to Target's corporate management back in May, where he said that allowing customers who are men according to their birth sex to go into women's restrooms has the potential of leading to criminal activity.",

            "article_content": "AP (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) Sigmund Freud would be smiling. Many days this election season, allegations of what Bill Clinton did with his private parts decades ago or whose genitals Donald Trump allegedly grabbed decades ago have had the power to dislodge job creation, tax structure, fighting terrorism or deterring North Korean aggression as the lead story of our national news. With the future of our country and the future of the world at stake, Americans and the news media can\u2019t help talking mostly about sex. This presidential election proves Freud was right: Sex is a drive so powerful that just talking about it \u2014 never mind having it \u2014 can eclipse all rational thought. And for this reason, reporting on the sexual behavior of anyone in public life, especially anyone seeking or holding public office, should be strictly beyond the pale, unless it has led to a criminal conviction. Let me say that again: Reporting on the sexual behavior of any public figure, especially our leaders, should be off-limits, unless the person has been convicted of a crime. We can\u2019t outlaw headlines about the sex lives of our leaders, of course, but we could resolve to consciously shame and shun those who sell them to us, like lines of cocaine on mirrors that reflect our primitive and irresistible drives. Why should the media not be held to account for getting the country so high off our animal instincts as men and women that we ignore our loftier ambitions as a people? Sexual behavior is not a reliable measure of character. We could also consciously hold ourselves to account for being distracted by sex to the extent that we have been this election season (and others). Just because there are drug dealers on lots of street corners in the world, that doesn\u2019t mean we have to stop and do the drug deals that, ultimately, disable our intellect and debase our discourse. Newspapers can be thrown away. Televisions and radios can be turned off. And if we can\u2019t do those things, then we are sex addicts, as surely as that clich\u00e9d fellow who used to sit alone, all day long, watching adult flicks in a darkened theater. As for those who would argue that we should know about the sexual behaviors of our leaders in order to know how they would lead the nation, no position could be less well-grounded. There is not a shred of evidence that exists, anywhere in the world, that proves that a man who is a satyr, or a woman who has a prolific sex life, marked by every manner of perversion, will be a poor steward of the nation. Sexual behavior is not a reliable measure of character. Let me say that, again, too: Sexual behavior is not a reliable measure of character. A man who brags that he could touch lots of women, if he wanted to, could be the one to save the free world from tyranny. The same is true for a woman who chose to stay married to her husband after he had oral sex with his intern in the home they shared with his teenage daughter. One has nothing to do with the other. Nothing. We\u2019re snorting lines and pixels of sex and getting high off them when we face grave challenges at home and abroad. That might be transfixing now, but it is no different from any other addiction: It has the power to transform us into a people enslaved not only by our instincts, but by more strategic and less intoxicated individuals with agendas other than freedom.",

            "article_content": "Fireworks at Hofstra University Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, in a fiery opening debate where seemingly nothing was off limits, clashed sharply Monday night as the Republican nominee worked to cast his rival as a career politician unable to bring change \u2013 and the Democratic nominee fought to tag Trump as an empty suit \u201chiding\u201d something from the American public. Entering their first encounter after a solid week of intense preparation, Clinton seemed ready for several of Trump\u2019s taunts on stage at Hofstra University. When Trump, discussing how he\u2019d been \u201call over\u201d the country talking to inner-city communities, said, \u201cYou decided to stay home, and that\u2019s okay\u201d \u2013 Clinton had a swift retort. \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Later in the debate, Trump summed up his counter-argument in a few words: \u201cHillary has experience, but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d The debate took a number of twists and turns, and it\u2019s unclear how and whether it will tilt the race at a time when the polls are tightening. The general election rivals will meet twice more on the debate stage next month. Despite some expectation-setting in the run-up to Monday\u2019s face-off that the candidates would bring a reserved demeanor, the niceties did not last long. Trump and Clinton clashed early and often and rarely did they dial back the tensions. Trump, toward the close of the debate, tried to undermine Clinton\u2019s persistent argument that he\u2019s temperamentally unfit for the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cI have a winning temperament. I know how to win,\u201d Trump said, before contrasting that against Clinton\u2019s widely mocked video-conference address last week to a labor union. Trump told Clinton \u201cyou were totally out of control.\u201d She countered: \u201cA man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.\u201d Trump also repeated his charge that Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d while Clinton responded by reviewing her secretary of state resume. \u201cAs soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease fire, release of dissidents \u2026 or even spends 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,\u201d she said. Trump used the debate to hammer campaign themes like calling for a return to \u201claw and order\u201d and vowing to bring jobs back to America. Clinton focused on rebuilding middle-class America as well. But in between, the debate veered into personal shots. Trump reached back to the 1990s to hammer her former president husband Bill Clinton over NAFTA, which he called \u201cthe worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere,\u201d and remind voters about her controversial comment from that era referring to some young criminals as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Clinton, though, had a sharp exchange with Trump as she challenged him to release his tax returns, which Trump has said he can\u2019t do because of an audit. Clinton questioned whether Trump is really as wealthy as he claims and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something he\u2019s hiding.\u201d Trump issued Clinton a challenge of his own, saying he\u2019ll defy his lawyers\u2019 advice and release his taxes if she releases the \u201c33,000 emails\u201d she erased. \u201cAs soon as she releases them, I will release my tax returns,\u201d Trump said. The tone of the debate seemed to get more caustic as the debate neared its end. Clinton said of Trump, \u201cThis is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.\u201d And they traded shots over Trump\u2019s role in questioning President Obama\u2019s birthplace. Clinton said he peddled a \u201cracist lie,\u201d while Trump said Clinton aides played a role as well. \u201cWhen you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. The debate was moderated by Lester Holt, who stayed out of the fray initially but toward the end challenged Trump on a handful of assertions including his claim he opposed the Iraq war. At one point, Trump also accused Clinton of \u201cfighting ISIS your entire adult life,\u201d and she later mocked him for blaming her for \u201ceverything\u201d and saying what she described as \u201ccrazy things.\u201d The Democratic nominee also ripped Trump over his tax plan, which she said would \u201cblow up the debt\u201d while mainly benefiting the wealthy. \u201cI call it trumped-up trickle down,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not how we grow the economy.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, described Clinton as late-to-the-game when it comes to scrutinizing American trade deals. \u201cSecretary Clinton and others \u2026 should have been doing this for years, not right now,\u201d he said. He said he wanted to keep jobs and business in the United States by threatening to tax companies that move jobs outside the U.S. He told Clinton pointedly, \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. \u2026 I will bring back jobs. You can\u2019t bring back jobs.\u201d He made a similar argument about her ability to take on the Islamic State. \u201cYou were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it\u2019s in over 30 countries. And you\u2019re gonna stop them? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. The presidential debate, six weeks before Election Day, was the first of three in the final stretch of the campaign. The general election foes\u2019 first face-off came as polling consistently shows a tightening race, in national surveys as well as in the battlegrounds that will decide the election. This put even more pressure on the candidates to turn in a stellar performance Monday night, and seize the advantage going into October. Polls show both candidates are viewed negatively by sizeable swaths of the electorate \u2013 but Clinton faced the primary task of settling questions about her honesty while Trump faced the task of proving to voters he\u2019s ready for the nation\u2019s highest office. The debate, though, seemed to gloss over two of the biggest trouble spots in Clinton\u2019s record \u2013 her personal email use as secretary of state and ethical questions surrounding the Clinton Foundation. The latter issue did not come up during the debate, while the emails were addressed briefly. While Trump has assailed Clinton throughout the campaign as dishonest, the Clinton campaign increasingly has pushed a narrative that Trump is temperamentally unfit to lead. The former secretary of state has enjoyed some help from influential voices in the media establishment, with The New York Times and Washington Post both publishing editorials Monday morning echoing that theme. But Trump has dismissed such critiques, maintaining the public confidence heading into Hofstra that he exuded throughout the Republican primaries \u2013 during which the first-time candidate and debater vanquished 16 foes and dominated the stage over the roughly dozen early-season debates. That record rendered him a rival not to be underestimated by the Clinton camp, which spent days preparing the Democratic nominee in study and mock-debate sessions even while Trump was out campaigning last week.",

            "article_content": "Reaction and insight from 'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are locked in a tight race across the country\u2019s most critical battleground states, according to new polling that challenges assumptions the presumptive Republican presidential nominee would enter a general election battle against the former secretary of state as the underdog. The Quinnipiac University Poll tested a Clinton-Trump match-up in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The two were close in every state, with Trump even edging Clinton in Ohio, 43-39 percent. In Florida, Clinton led Trump 43-42 percent. The Democratic primary front-runner held the same 1-point edge in Pennsylvania as well. \u201cSix months from Election Day, the presidential races between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the three most crucial states, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are too close to call,\u201d Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, said in a statement, also noting that Trump at this point is doing better in Pennsylvania than the GOP nominees in 2008 and 2012. The polling is still just a snapshot. Most national polls continue to show Clinton leading Trump in a general election match-up, and the overall electoral map is widely thought to favor Democrats in November. But, as noted by Quinnipiac, no candidate since 1960 has won the race for the White House without winning at least two of the three swing states tested here. The poll also could partly reflect changing attitudes toward Trump since he effectively wrapped up the Republican nomination last week, when his two remaining rivals bowed out of the race. The Quinnipiac polling was taken in the period before and after Trump became the presumptive nominee, from April 27-May 9. The new swing state numbers also could help boost Democratic primary underdog Bernie Sanders\u2019 case that he could be a stronger general election candidate against Trump. He edged Trump by 2 or more points in every state polled, performing better than Clinton. He also did better than either Clinton or Trump in terms of favorability ratings; the two primary front-runners were viewed negatively across all three swing states. Clinton, though, maintains a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders. The two are battling Tuesday in the West Virginia primary, but even if Sanders wins, his only viable path to getting the nomination would be to somehow convince hundreds of \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 party insiders free to back whichever candidate they want \u2013 to abandon Clinton and side with him. The Quinnipiac polls of 1,051 Florida voters; 1,042 Ohio voters; and 1,077 Pennsylvania voters each had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",

Few details have been released about the death Sunday of Caleb Thomas Schwab, the son of a Kansas state legislator. The 168-foot-tall Verruckt is one of the top attractions of Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas. The park was closed Monday amid the investigation.

Kansas City police spokesman Officer Cameron Morgan said no police report was available of the incident and deferred additional questions to the park. In an email Monday, Winter Prosapio, spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn, said the park would not be \"participating in any further media interviews at this time.\" A day earlier, she told reporters that Caleb had been at the park with family members, adding \"We honestly don't know what's happened.\" Riders go down the slide in multi-person rafts. Each rider must be at least 54 inches tall and the weight of the group is limited to a total of 400 to 550 pounds. Because of heavy demand, rides are scheduled by reservation at the time the park opens each day. The park's website touts the ride as the \"ultimate in water slide thrills,\" subjecting \"adventure seekers\" with a \"jaw dropping\" 17-story drop, \"only to be blasted back up a second massive hill and then sent down yet another gut wrenching 50 foot drop.\" Young boy dies on water slide at Schlitterbahn, family's pastor issues a statement  https://t.co/8M3j6EfDrC pic.twitter.com/gCflMNZpnc Verruckt, which means \"insane\" in German, was certified as the world's tallest waterslide by Guinness World Records. State Rep. Scott Schwab, an Olathe Republican, and his wife, Michele, released a statement asking for privacy as the family grieves. \"Since the day he was born, he brought abundant joy to our family and all those he came in contact with,\" the statement said. Authorities initially said the victim was 12 years old, but Clint Sprague, a pastor acting as the family's spokesman, said Caleb was 10 and is one of the couple's four sons. House Speaker Ray Merrick told the Kansas City Star that Schwab's family was \"the center of his world.\" Verruckt's 2014 opening was repeatedly delayed, though the operators didn't explain why. Two media sneak preview days in 2014 were canceled because of problems with a conveyor system that hauls 100-pound rafts to the top of the slide. In a news article linked to the news release announcing a 2014 delay, Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry told USA Today that he and senior designer John Schooley had based their calculations when designing the slide on roller coasters, but that didn't translate well to a waterslide like Verruckt. In early tests, rafts carrying sandbags flew off the slide, prompting engineers to tear down half of the ride and reconfigure some angles at a cost of $1 million, Henry said. A promotional video for a show about building the slide includes footage of two men riding a raft down a half-size test model and going slightly airborne as it crests the top of the first big hill. Prosapio said Sunday that the park's rides are inspected daily and by an \"outside party\" before the start of each season. Without specifically mentioning water slides, Kansas statutes describe an \"amusement ride\" as \"any mechanical or electrical device that carries or conveys passengers along, around or over a fixed or restricted route or course or within a defined area for the purpose of giving its passengers amusement, pleasure, thrills or excitement.\" Such rides, according to the statute, commonly are known as Ferris wheels, carousels, parachute towers, bungee jumps and roller coasters. State law leaves it to the Kansas Department of Labor to adopt rules and regulations relating to certification and inspection of rides, adding that an amusement ride at a permanent location \"shall be self-inspected by a qualified inspector at least every 12 months.\" Messages left Monday with Kansas' Labor Department were not immediately returned. Kansas state Sen. Greg Smith, an Overland Park Republican, said that although state law doesn't specifically address waterslides, it's clear they \"would fall into that category.\" He called any potential legislative action spurred by Sunday's tragedy premature, saying the investigation of Caleb Schwab's death should be given time to unfold. \"Until we have those facts it's too early to specify what we can do legislatively,\" Smith said.",

            "article_content": "GOP nominee calls violence in cities a 'national crisis' Donald Trump walked a political tightrope Saturday -- promising in heartland Iowa to help farmers across the country by cutting taxes and federal regulations while continuing his stark appeal to potentially disaffected minority voters in U.S. inner cities. \u201cWe are going to end this war on the American farmer,\u201d Trump told the crowd at Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst\u2019s influential \u201cRoast and Ride\u201d rally in Des Moines. In a roughly 45-minute address in which Trump largely stuck to measured and prepared remarks, the Republican presidential nominee also repeatedly tried to distinguish himself from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and appealed to evangelicals and others to assist him in helping minorities and winning the November election. \u201cClinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steel workers,\u201d said Trump, warning her plan includes \u201cradical\u201d regulations and raising taxes on family farms, to rates as high as nearly 50 percent. He again pointed out that Clinton in the mid-1990s said some black youths were \u201csuper predators\u201d and returned to his argument in recent weeks that the Democratic nominee\u2019s policies and those of fellow Democrats who for decades have run many U.S. cities have failed their minority residents, particularly African-Americans. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken a lot in recent days about the deplorable conditions in many of our inner cities,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs a father, as a builder, as an American, it offends my sense of right and wrong to see anyone living in such conditions. \u201cI am running to offer a better future -- to the citizens of Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, and all across this great land. \u2026 Now is the time to put a new agenda into action that expands opportunity, ensures equality and that protects the rights of each and every citizen. \u2026 We are also going to end the discrimination that traps parents and kids in failing government schools.\u201d Trump earlier this week said Clinton was a \u201cbigot\u201d for having policies that hold down minorities. Clinton responded during an interview Friday on MSNBC by claiming Trump has a \u201clong history of racial discrimination\" and that his campaign is \"built on prejudice and paranoia.\" Trump on Saturday also mentioned the fatal shooting Friday of 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge, the cousin of NBA star Dwayne Wade and a mother of four. Aldridge was shot and killed while pushing a child in a stroller on Chicago\u2019s South Side, the apparent victim of an attack by two males on another male. \u201cWe send our thoughts and our prayers to the family,\u201d said Trump who was criticized on social media because a tweet earlier in the day on the killing appeared only for political advantage, failing to include condolences. Trump, who has for days struggled to find the right message on illegal immigration, returned to the matter Saturday, arguing that enforcing immigration law is a \u201ccivil rights issue\u201d and that Clinton\u2019s policies will allow amnesty for people living illegally in the United States and increase the risk of Islamic terrorists getting into the country. \u201cA vote for Trump is a vote to have a nation of laws. A vote for Clinton is a vote for open borders,\u201d said Trump, who is trailing Clinton by 6 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average. Trump, who has promised if elected to deport all of the country\u2019s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, also said Saturday that the rights of American citizen are violated every time a black citizen, Hispanic citizen or any citizen loses his or her job to an illegal immigrant. \u201cEqual protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws,\u201d said Trump, repeating his vow since the start of his campaign to build a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cMy goal is to provide good jobs, good schools, and safety to every Hispanic community in the country. But we can\u2019t do that if we don\u2019t secure our border. \u201cOn Day One, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country -- including removing the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into U.S. communities under the Obama-Clinton administration. These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Shown here is North Carolina House candidate Christian Cano, right. (FNC) Democrat Christian Cano may be better known for wearing a cowboy hat than for his political experience. But the hotel consultant hopes to unseat second-term North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger \u2013 and is getting a potential boost from the redrawing of the incumbent\u2019s 9th Congressional District. That district now stretches from Charlotte to Fayetteville. Susan Roberts, a political science professor at Davidson College, said the incumbent now \u201chas a lot of counties where people don\u2019t know much about him.\u201d \u201cSo, if they only know about the headlines, they\u2019re probably not going to have as positive a view. He won\u2019t have been able to do constituency service, which usually helps incumbents,\u201d she said. Earlier this fall, Pittenger had to walk back comments he made during a Sept. 22 interview with the BBC. When asked about violent protests following a fatal police shooting in Charlotte, Pittenger told a BBC presenter, \u201cThe grievance in their mind is the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and they\u2019re not.\u201d Pittenger has since apologized for the way the comments came out, but insists he was trying to paraphrase what he heard a protester say on TV. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those comments that I could have said much different and regret the way I said it,\u201d Pittenger told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cBut, frankly, I was repeating what another individual said.\u201d Cano, who wears a cowboy hat in honor of his World War II veteran grandfather, may personify some of the challenges Pittenger faces. A Latino member of the LGBT community, he\u2019s running as a voice for change in a more diverse district. \u201cThose of us who have worked in the real world, and worked with diverse people, know that the more diverse we are, the stronger we are and the more competitive we are,\u201d Cano said. Pittenger is also running on a change platform \u2014 calling for a break from ObamaCare and other government mandates on business. \u201cWe could be doing better in terms of growing this economy,\u201d Pittenger said. \u201cWe need to reduce the regulatory burden on small business. We need to reduce the regulatory burden on small financial \u00a0institutions.\u201d According to Federal Election Commission filings, Pittenger has spent approximately $1 million against his opponent, who is not nearly as well-funded. Under ordinary circumstances, North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District would seem to be fairly safe for a Republican incumbent seeking reelection. But with redistricting and a volatile presidential race, this election is anything but ordinary. Fox News\u2019 David Lewkowict contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bias Bash: Cal Thomas weighs in on the 2016 presidential election and how the media is covering each candidate I love definitions because they help focus the mind. Under dictionary.com\u2019s definition of \u201ccorrupt\u201d one finds the following: 1. Guilty of dishonest practices, as bribery; lacking integrity; crooked: 2. Debased in character; depraved; perverted; wicked; evil: 3. Infected; tainted. When used as a verb with an object we find: 4. To destroy the integrity of; cause to be dishonest, disloyal, etc., especially by bribery. 5. To lower morally; pervert. Don\u2019t these definitions perfectly describe Hillary Clinton? As the FBI re-starts its prematurely halted investigation into Hillary\u2019s \u201cextremely careless\u201d handling of classified materials, perhaps this time it will conclude what it should have concluded the first time around \u2014 that the Democratic presidential candidate and some of her aides engaged not just in carelessness, but in criminal activity. And isn\u2019t it wonderfully ironic that the trip wire for the FBI\u2019s announcement had to do with emails found on disgraced former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer and probably (you should pardon the expression) his hand-held device on which he sexted with women and underage girls? Among the computers reportedly seized by FBI agents is one Weiner shared with his wife and top Hillary aide, Huma Abedin, from whom Weiner is now separated. Typical of political Washington is the reaction by liberal Democrats, including Hillary Clinton herself. When FBI Director James Comey said in July there was nothing in Hillary\u2019s behavior that warranted an indictment, liberals claimed she had been exonerated and praised Comey for his professionalism. Now that possibly new evidence has emerged necessitating another look, Democrats and the left are jumping on Comey as a political hack. They can\u2019t have it both ways, though they often try. Another argument made by those favoring a second Clinton presidency is that she is not her husband and that Bill\u2019s lying and extramarital affairs should not reflect on her. Really? It was Bill who bragged when he was running for president in 1992 that if he was elected \u201cyou get two for the price of one.\u201d That exchange rate hasn\u2019t changed. He was right then. They are both sleazy and enabling of each other. If Hillary wins the election, the corruption (hers and his) will follow her into the White House because that is her character and also his. If Republicans hold a congressional majority, investigations into Clinton corruption will continue and government gridlock will be worse than it is now. Hillary Clinton would be the most unpopular president to enter the White House in modern times, perhaps of all time. Republicans and even some principled Democrats (there are a few), not to mention foreign leaders, would immediately regard her as weak and possibly a failure from the start. Her promises to continue and even expand the Obama \u201clegacy\u201d would not sit well with many Americans who are having difficulty finding jobs and are seeing their health insurance premiums skyrocket. Donald Trump is a roll of the dice, but sometimes the dice come up a \u201cseven,\u201d not snake eyes. Whatever his character flaws, at least he would start something new, including protecting the Constitution, and promising to name judges who respect it. That possibility, along with Hillary Clinton\u2019s severe character deficiencies, recommends that voters bet on a fresh start and give Trump a chance.",
