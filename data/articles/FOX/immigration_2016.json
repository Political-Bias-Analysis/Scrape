            "article_content": "In this Aug. 9, 2012, file photo, suspected illegal immigrants are transferred out of the holding area after being processed at the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Tucson, Ariz. (AP) A push to close the country\u2019s privately run or contracted immigration detention centers is drawing fire from lawmakers and law enforcement experts worried that doing so could lead to more overcrowding -- and even amount to a post-election \u201cgift\u201d to public employee unions. The Homeland Security Advisory Council will make recommendations to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Nov. 30 on whether to close the private centers. Johnson announced a review of the sites on Aug. 29, shortly after the Justice Department announced the Bureau of Prisons would reduce and ultimately end the use of privately run federal prisons in response to an audit. However, closing the contracted immigration sites would require an 800 percent expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement capacity, according to ICE. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a need for these private prisons,\u201d Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, told FoxNews.com, citing ICE\u2019s own numbers in saying they\u2019re arresting \u201cmore than 100,000 criminal illegal immigrants.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve registered my concerns [with the administration] and I strenuously oppose closing these private facilities.\u201d While the Obama administration already is moving to end the use of private general-purpose prisons, ending the use of such centers to hold illegal immigrants could have a far bigger impact. While only 10 percent of federal prisoners are in private facilities, about 60 percent of ICE detainees pending deportation procedures are held in contracted facilities. Their population fluctuates, but averages nearly 34,000 per day, according to ICE. Immigration rights activists originally asked President Obama in August to close down those detention centers. But there could be another factor at play. Matthew Vadum, senior vice president for the Capital Research Center, a think tank that investigates liberal nonprofits, said the push is driven to benefit activists and labor unions. \u201cThis will benefit government unions by providing more opportunities for federal workers and expand unions. De-privatizing doesn\u2019t mean shutting down all of these detention centers,\u201d Vadum told FoxNews.com. \u201cSome will be taken over by the government. This is a gift to the labor movement, but first and foremost it\u2019s ideological, based on the de-incarceration movement.\u201d As of August, ICE uses 182 adult detention facilities, only 10 percent of which are federal government-owned. The rest are in contracted facilities, in many cases with local governments such as county jails. This admittedly makes the immigrant centers more complex than the federal prisons, said Jeremy Mohler, spokesman for the liberal group, In The Public Interest, which has long advocated against both private prisons and detention centers. He acknowledged that public employee unions favor closing the centers but said it goes beyond self-interest. \u201cFederal employee unions are interested in having public facilities because that means more union employment in the long run and work conditions will be better,\u201d Mohler told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not just self-interest. Unions are interested in not throwing [immigrant] families into torturous situations.\u201d In The Public Interest is a project of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition of several progressive groups that includes labor unions. The private immigration centers are actually in the interest of the illegal immigrant detainees, contends Gerges Scott, a former deputy secretary for the New Mexico Department of Corrections. \u201cIf DHS closes these detention centers, the detainees will be shipped to overcrowded federal centers,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWomen and children, they will be separated, but they will still be in the same facility with dangerous illegal immigrants. As a former corrections official and taxpayer, this is a concern to me.\u201d During Scott\u2019s time in office from 1999 through 2002, New Mexico was under a federal order to deal with state prison overcrowding and the state legislature was in no mood to build new prisons. So, the state contracted with private prisons, which he said are more accountable and efficient. \u201cPrivate prisons have the same standards and guidelines as federal prisons,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThere is a lot more accountability for private prisons. Union workers in public prisons provide a lot of leniency for their employees. In a private prison, a majority are not unionized, so the oversight is very rigid.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union disputes that assessment. The legal group helped conduct a review that found over a two-year period, six of the eight deaths attributable to substandard medical care in the immigration centers were at contract facilities, ACLU staff attorney Carl Takei told FoxNews.com. But, he adds, if the DHS is going to conduct \u201ca meaningful review, it has to tackle ICE\u2019s incarceration policy.\u201d The head of one large private prison operator, GEO Group, Inc., said he welcomes the review. \u201cOur public-private partnership has allowed ICE to transfer services from older public jail facilities that did not meet the most up-to-date national standards to GEO\u2019s highly rated, cost-effective facilities,\u201d said George C. Zoley, GEO\u2019s chairman, in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are confident that this independent review will show that GEO has provided needed, cost-effective services that have resulted in significantly improved safety outcomes for the men and women in ICE\u2019s care and custody.\u201d ICE reportedly has had $1.18 billion in contracts with GEO since 2008. Another private firm, Corrections Corp of America, got $689 million in ICE contracts since 2008. CCA spokesman Jonathan Burns said the company has worked with the federal government for 30 years and also welcomes the review. \"This effort builds on the unfettered, daily, onsite access ICE officials have to our facilities and the thousands of government audits we\u2019re subject to each year,\" Burns told FoxNews.com. \"We\u2019re proud of the quality and value of the services we provide and look forward to sharing that information.\"",

            "article_content": "Refugees enter amid security debate The Obama administration hit its goal this week of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees -- yet only a fraction of a percent are Christians, stoking criticism that officials are not doing enough to address their plight in the Middle East. Of the 10,801 refugees accepted in fiscal 2016 from the war-torn country, 56 are Christians, or .5 percent. A total of 10,722 were Muslims, and 17 were Yazidis. The numbers are disproportionate to the Christian population in Syria, estimated last year by the U.S. government to make up roughly 10 percent of the population. Since the outbreak of civil war in 2011, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million Christians have fled the country, while many have been targeted and slaughtered by the Islamic State. In March, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. had determined that ISIS has committed genocide against minority religious groups, including Christians and Yazidis. \u201cIn my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims,\u201d Kerry said at the State Department, using an alternative Arabic name for the group. He also accused ISIS of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \"ethnic cleansing.\" Yet, despite the strong words, relatively few from those minority groups have been brought into the United States. A State Department spokesperson told FoxNews.com that religion was only one of many factors used in determining a refugee\u2019s eligibility to enter the United States. Critics blasted the administration for not making religion a more important factor, as the U.S. government has prioritized religious minorities in the past in other cases. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointingly disproportional,\u201d Matthew Clark, senior counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), told FoxNews.com. \u201c[The Obama administration has] not prioritized Christians and it appears they have actually deprioritized them, put them back of the line and made them an afterthought.\u201d \u201cThis is de facto discrimination and a gross injustice,\u201d said Nina Shea, director of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom. Experts say another reason for the lack of Christians in the make-up of the refugees is the make-up of the camps. Christians in the main United Nations refugee camp in Jordan are subject to persecution, they say, and so flee the camps, meaning they are not included in the refugees referred to the U.S. by the U.N. \u201cThe Christians don\u2019t reside in those camps because it is too dangerous,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThey are preyed upon by other residents from the Sunni community and there is infiltration by ISIS and criminal gangs.\u201d \u201cThey are raped, abducted into slavery and they are abducted for ransom. It is extremely dangerous, there is not a single Christian in the Jordanian camps for Syrian refugees,\u201d Shea said. However, Kristin Wright, director of advocacy for Open Doors USA \u2013 a group that advocates for Christians living in dangerous areas across the world \u2013 told FoxNews.com that another reason is many Christians are choosing to stick it out in Syria, or going instead to urban areas for now. \u201cMany have fled to urban areas instead of the camps, so they may be living in Beirut instead of living in a broader camp, meaning many are not registering as refugees,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThey may still come to the U.S. but may come through another immigration pathway.\u201d However, others called on the Obama administration, in light of its genocide declaration, to do more to assist Christians, including setting up safe zones in Syria or actively seeking out Christians via the use of contractors to bring them to safety. In March, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced legislation that would give special priority to refugees who were members of persecuted religious minorities in Syria. \u201cWe must not only recognize what's happening as genocide, but also take action to relieve it,\" Cotton said. \u201cThe administration did the right thing by recognizing genocide, but by not taking action, it deflates it and makes it so Christians and others are not receiving any help,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all words and no actions, it\u2019s just lip service on the issue of the genocide.\u201d This week, the ACLJ filed a lawsuit against the State Department for not responding to Freedom of Information Act requests about what the administration is doing to combat the genocide. For Shea, the question is not just about helping refugees, but the very survival of Christianity in the 2,000-year community that has existed since the apostolic era of Christianity. \"This Christian community is dying,\" she said. \"I fear that there will be no Christians left when the dust settles.\"",

            "article_content": "Correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports from Scranton, Pennsylvania Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented \u201cDreamers\u201d into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump\u2019s immigration plans could result in their deportation \u2013 though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. Clinton's national voter registration program, called \"Mi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,\" was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee. Organizers will remind voters that a Trump presidency would end the Dreamer program, according to the campaign, which is already at risk after a June Supreme Court effectively killed Obama's efforts to give legal status to some of the 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The program is part of an aggressive effort by Clinton's campaign to woo the record 27.3 million Latinos eligible to vote in 2016. Polling shows Trump doing worse with Latino voters than any GOP presidential candidate since 1996. Much of the new effort will focus on battleground states including Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina and Florida, where Latinos and other immigrants make up an important part of the voting base. Though Obama's campaign had no formal organization program for Dreamers, door-knocking by those young immigrants, who have lived and attended school in the U.S., helped mobilize many Latino voters who could vote. Clinton believes she can harness their power in a more formal way, particularly given her opponent. Trump's immigration rhetoric has sparked outrage and fear within the Latino community, though the Republican nominee says it's critical that the country start rigorously enforcing its immigration laws. He's promised to revoke Obama's executive orders within the first 100 days of his presidency, calling them the \"most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president.\" Clinton has made revamping the country's immigration system a key plank of her presidential campaign. She has said she will introduce legislation during her first 100 days in office, vowed to restore and expand Obama's programs, close private sector detention centers and to \"take a very hard look at the deportation policies\" now in force. Last month, she called on Latino voters to help stop what she called GOP rival Donald Trump's efforts to \"fan the flames of racial division.\" The following is the full Clinton campaign statement on the latest program, per The Washington Examiner: On DACA's Four- Year Anniversary, Hillary for America Launches National Voter Registration Program, \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" On the four- year anniversary tomorrow when the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' (DACA) enrollment began, Hillary for America is launching a national voter registration program, \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" (My Dream, Your Vote), to organize DREAMers to mobilize their communities and ask voters to consider what is at stake for their families in November. \"DREAMers have played a pivotal role in our campaign, advocating for families who constantly live in fear of deportation \u2014 so we've created a program that aims to turn these stories into action,\" said Lorella Praeli, National Director of the Latino Vote. The program calls on DREAMers across the country to join the campaign's grassroots efforts to secure commitments from their community to vote for their future in November. \"We founded this program on the premise that, one by one \u2014 through friends, families, co-workers or classmates \u2014 DREAMers' futures would be considered on Election day, \" stated Praeli.\" \"We may not have the right to vote, but \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" will help ensure that our stories are heard and it will send a clear signal to Donald Trump that we cannot be silenced,\" said Astrid Silva, Nevada DREAMer and immigrant rights activist. Hillary for America will be holding events across the country this week, including in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina, to unveil the program. \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" will also serve to remind voters of Donald Trump's hateful and dangerous agenda, highlighting his pledge to eliminate DACA and deport millions of DREAMers and immigrant families.

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Washington Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on the FBI Friday to release all information in its renewed investigation into her use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails \u2013 apparently during the probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting \u2013 in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. \"[FBI Director James Comey] himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails ... are significant or not,\" Clinton told reporters in Iowa Friday evening. \"I\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it\u2019s imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.\" Earlier Friday, Comey informed top members of Congress in a letter that the bureau had \u201clearned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ THE LETTER Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced \u201cin connection with an unrelated case.\u201d An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced ex-Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI\u2019s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, \u201cGood grief,\u201d after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. The Clinton campaign called the decision to revisit the case so close to the election \u201cextraordinary,\u201d and urged Comey to provide more details. Comey gave only a brief overview in his letter to lawmakers of what prompted their decision. He wrote that the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, \u201cand I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete \u201cthis additional work.\u201d 1,000 CLINTON-PETRAEUS EMAILS MISSING FROM RECORDS SENT TO STATE, FBI FILES SHOW FBI, DOJ ROILED BY DECISION TO LET CLINTON SLIDE, SAY SOURCES The move comes after Comey and the Justice Department decided in July not to pursue charges over Clinton's email practices, saying at the time that the investigation was finished. Comey later came under criticism from Trump, GOP lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during Clinton's tenure. Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the \u201ccourage\u201d to \u201cright the horrible mistake that they made\u201d \u2013 saying he hopes that is \u201ccorrected.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d In a nod to the significance of the FBI\u2019s announcement, Trump quipped: \u201cThe rest of my speech is going to be so boring.\u201d Other GOP lawmakers also weighed in, urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the discovery must be \u201cserious\u201d for the bureau to investigate this close to the election. Clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city. But Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta sharply questioned the FBI's move and said Comey should \"immediately provide\" more information. \"Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,\u201d he said in a statement. Podesta said \u201cwe have no idea what those emails [that have come to light] are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d According to a source connected to the Clinton campaign who spoke to law enforcement, the FBI has four devices \u2013 one belongs to Abedin, and at least one belongs to Weiner. So far, no classified information has been found on the devices, Fox News is told. The development comes 11 days before the general election, and is the latest shockwave to hit the race. Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him which he denies. However, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat's campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem. Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were \"livid\" at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation. \"He lit her on fire and then walked away,\" Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton's mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges. Hosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision \"based on what they have\" at the time. Hosko said he thinks agents found emails that made them say, \"Oh my God look at what we have.\" BREAKING NEWS \u2192 The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton.My full statement \u21e9 pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk House Speaker Paul Ryan called the FBI decision \"long overdue.\" But former Obama administration spokesman Tommy Vietor chided the bureau on Twitter.

            "article_content": "A look at the voters that decided the election NATIONAL Donald Trump\u2019s victory today came as a deeply divided country opted for change. His strength among white voters \u2013 and particularly working-class whites \u2013 led to an impressive performance in the upper Midwest, and he was able to attract enough support from blacks and Hispanics to hold Hillary Clinton at bay. The election was marked by a record gender gap and widespread voter concern about the candidates\u2019 honesty. Trump also weathered concerns about his temperament, qualifications, and treatment of women. Trump won among men by 12 percentage points, while women backed Clinton by 12 points. This 24-point gender gap eclipses the previous record of 22 points, set in the 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Trump dramatically improved on Mitt Romney\u2019s performance among men \u2013 the Republican won by 7 among men in 2012. Clinton only improved slightly on President Barack Obama\u2019s 11-point margin among women. Plus, women made up 52 percent of the electorate, down one point from 2012 and similar to 1996 and 2000 (52 percent). She won blacks by 80 points, down from Obama\u2019s 87-point margin in 2012. Hispanics opted for Clinton by 36 points, a dramatic decrease from Obama\u2019s 44-point win in the last election. Nearly three-in-ten Hispanics (29 percent) voted for Trump, more than the 27 percent Romney received in 2012. Trump won by 21 points among white voters, an uptick from Romney\u2019s 20-point edge in 2012 and the widest Republican margin among whites since at least 1992. White men voted for Trump by 32 points, while white women broke for him by 10 points. Some of Trump\u2019s strongest support came from white voters without a college degree (67 percent) \u2013 and particularly white men without a degree (72 percent). Voters with a college degree favored Clinton by nine points, though college-educated whites went for Trump, 49-45 percent. Trump also ran up big margins among core Republican constituencies, including conservatives (81 percent) and white evangelicals (81 percent). These numbers were comparable to Romney\u2019s performance (82 percent among conservatives, 78 percent among white evangelicals). Democrats made up 37 percent of the electorate and Republicans 33. That is a decrease in the Democratic, when they held a 38-32 percent edge. Union households \u2013 long a stronghold of Democratic support \u2013 went for Clinton by eight points. That\u2019s a 10-point drop from Obama\u2019s total last time, and the lowest union support for a Democrat in the past 20 years. THE CANDIDATES Four-in-ten voters (39 percent) were looking for a candidate who could bring about needed change. These voters favored Trump, 83-14 percent. Clinton won those who wanted a candidate who cares about people like them by 23 points, by 40 among those who prioritized judgment, and by 82 among those who said experience was the most important quality to their vote. After a campaign dominated by various candidate scandals and not the issues, voters had unfavorable opinions of both candidates. Clinton\u2019s favorability was under water by 10 points (44 percent favorable and 54 percent unfavorable). Still, that\u2019s better than views of Trump: 38 percent favorable, 60 percent unfavorable. Voters were put off by Trump\u2019s controversial comments about women. Fully seven-in-ten voters said his treatment of women bothered them. These voters favored Clinton, 65 to 29 percent. Controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state reemerged in the final days of the campaign, and 63 percent of voters were bothered by her email practices. This hurt Clinton, as 70 percent of those bothered by her email scandal went for Trump. Against this backdrop, just 41 percent cast their vote because they strongly favored their candidate. More said they liked their candidate but had reservations (32 percent) or disliked the other candidates (25 percent). Trump\u2019s supporters were split between favoring their candidate (37 percent), liking him but with reservations (33 percent), and voting against Clinton (28 percent). Clinton voters, on the other hand, were more likely to say they favored their candidate (46 percent) than say they liked her with reservations (32 percent) or disliked Trump (21 percent). Voters did not see either candidate as honest and trustworthy, though ratings were slightly better for Clinton (36 percent) than for Trump (33 percent). Clinton was seen as the more qualified candidate and the one with the temperament to lead. Over half (55 percent) of voters said Clinton had the right temperament. Far fewer \u2013 35 percent \u2013 said the same of Trump. Voters had similar evaluations of the candidates\u2019 qualifications: 52 percent said Clinton was qualified for the job, compared to 38 percent who said the same of Trump. MOOD OF THE COUNTRY Trump\u2019s win came as a majority of Americans were dissatisfied (46 percent) or angry (23 percent) with the way the federal government is working. Trump won big among these \u201cangry\u201d voters. Half of the electorate thinks the government is doing too many things better left to business and individuals. That\u2019s about the same as 2012 (51 percent). More than six-in-ten voters have a gloomy assessment of the economy: 41 percent rate the economy as \u201cnot so good\u201d and another 21 percent say \u201cpoor.\u201d Still, that\u2019s an improvement from 2012: 45 percent not so good and 31 percent poor. Although they may not be happy with the way the government is working or the state of the economy, a 53-percent majority approves of the job Obama is doing as president. Bill Clinton left office with a 57-percent approval rating in 2000, while Bush had 27-percent approval in 2008. Despite the president\u2019s approval rating, more voters think the next commander-in-chief should adopt more conservative policies (48 percent) than continue Obama\u2019s policies (28 percent) or adopt more liberal ones (17 percent). E pluribus unum? After an election season that included protests of police use of force against minorities and claims by Trump that the system was rigged against him and his supporters, Americans are deeply divided about the fairness of U.S. institutions. Overall, a 48-point plurality thinks the nation\u2019s criminal justice system is unfair to blacks. Slightly fewer \u2013 43 percent \u2013 think the system is fair to all. Black voters are particularly likely to feel the system treats them unfairly (81 percent). THE ISSUES For more than half of voters (52 percent), the economy is the most important issue facing the country. Far fewer cite terrorism (18 percent), foreign policy (13 percent) and immigration (13 percent). More voters trust Trump to handle the economy: 49-46 percent. Clinton is trusted by more to handle foreign policy, 52-43 percent. For two-in-ten voters (21 percent), appointments to the Supreme Court was the most important issue to their vote. These voters broke for Trump, 56-41 percent. Seven-in-ten voters think illegal immigrants currently working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship (70 percent), rather than being deported (25 percent). In 2012, 65 percent said chance for citizenship and 28 percent favored deportation. Clinton won those who believe illegals should have a chance at citizenship by 26 points. Trump dominated among those who prefer deportation (+70 points). Trump\u2019s signature immigration proposal \u2013 to build a wall along the Mexican border \u2013 received support from 41 percent of voters. Three-in-ten Latinos (29 percent) support the idea. WISCONSIN Trump\u2019s strength among working-class white voters carried him to an upset win in Wisconsin, as he became the first Republican to win the Badger State since 1984. Trump did better among white men (59 percent) than Romney did in 2012 (56 percent). Clinton garnered 48 percent among white women, well below the 53 percent Obama got in 2012. White voters without a college degree proved to be the bulwark of Trump\u2019s support, as he racked up a 63-32 percent win among this group. College-educated whites broke for Clinton by a narrower 10-point margin. Trump\u2019s criticism of NAFTA and other U.S. trade deals played well in Wisconsin. Half of Wisconsin voters think international trade takes away U.S. jobs (50 percent), while 35 percent think it creates jobs. And those who say it takes away jobs heavily favored Trump: 63-32 percent. Union workers have long been a source of support for Democrats in Wisconsin \u2013 two-thirds (66%) voted for Obama in 2012. But Trump cut into this margin, as Clinton only won 52 percent of the union vote. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and the subsequent FBI investigation also played a big role: 66 percent of Wisconsin voters said Clinton\u2019s email practices bothered them. These voters broke for Trump by a 50-point margin. Trump spent time in Wisconsin toward the end of the campaign. That, combined with the FBI\u2019s additional investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails, may have tipped the state into Trump\u2019s column. He won a majority of late-deciding voters. OHIO As Ohio goes, so goes the nation: the last seven Republicans who have won the state have won the presidency. Donald Trump flipped the state into the Republican column this year. Trump\u2019s criticism of international trade played particularly well in Ohio. Nearly half of Ohio voters (48 percent) think trade with other countries takes away jobs, compared 32 percent who think it creates jobs. Those who think trade hurts jobs broke for Trump by 67-29 percent margin. His message on trade also appears to have helped him among union voters. He won a majority of union members \u2013 52 percent \u2013 a dramatic improvement over the 37 percent Romney took home in 2012. White evangelical voters made up one-third of the electorate (33 percent), up from 31 percent last time around. Trump made major inroads among these voters, winning 76 percent \u2013 an improvement on Romney\u2019s 69 percent. In 2012, Obama won among voters without a college degree, 53-46 percent. This year, that dynamic flipped: Trump won those without college degrees by 4 points. He won college graduates by eight points. Clinton was also hurt by a downturn in support from black voters. While African-Americans turned out (they made up 14 percent of the electorate this year and 15 percent in 2012), she won 90 percent of them \u2013 down from Obama\u2019s 96-percent win. FLORIDA Trump won the Sunshine State thanks to an uptick in support among non-white voters. The white share of the electorate has continued to decline \u2013 from 71 percent in 2008, to 67 percent in 2012, and 62 percent this year. Trump won Florida\u2019s white voters by 31 points. Trump racked up large margins among both college-educated whites (+27 points) and working class whites (+35 points). Florida\u2019s Latino voters turned out in force, accounting for 19 percent of all voters, up from 17 percent last time around. Clinton won 63 percent of Latinos, up from the 60 percent that Obama won in 2012. Trump won by 13 points among Florida\u2019s sizable Cuban-American population, a dramatic reversal of Obama\u2019s two-point win in 2012. Trump also doubled the support Romney received from black voters, tallying 8 percent this year. Nearly half of all Floridians felt Obama\u2019s signature health care law went too far (46 percent). Trump won these voters by a whopping 78-17 margin. Florida has a large share of seniors, a group that favored Trump by 18 percentage points. Seniors went for Romney by 17 points in 2012. NORTH CAROLINA With the first African-American president no longer on the ballot, the electorate in North Carolina was less diverse than in 2012 \u2013 which led to a win for Trump. White voters made up 71 percent of the electorate this year, and broke for Trump by 30 points. Trump amassed huge wins among working-class whites (+44 points) and white evangelicals (+64 points). The \u201cObama coalition\u201d did not warm to Clinton. She underperformed among both non-whites and young voters. Blacks accounted for 19 percent of the electorate, down from 23 percent in 2012. While Clinton won blacks by 83 points, that was a decrease from Obama\u2019s 92-point margin. Clinton\u2019s margin among Hispanics (+20 points) was also a notable drop from Obama\u2019s 37-point margin in 2012. Young voters propelled Obama to victory in North Carolina in 2008 and kept the state close in 2012 \u2013 but Clinton won 60 percent of the young vote this year, well off the 67 percent Obama won last time. Racial tensions in North Carolina came to the forefront this year after the killing of a black man by Charlotte police officers in September and allegations that the state curtailed blacks\u2019 access to early voting. Voters were divided on whether the justice system treats all people fairly (41 percent) or treats blacks unfairly (47 percent). Most blacks (81 percent) feel the system treats them unfairly. COLORADO The changing Colorado electorate provided Clinton a much-needed swing state win. She benefitted from strong support among Latinos, young voters and newcomers to the state. Latino voters accounted for 13 percent of the Colorado electorate, down from 14 percent in 2012. Clinton won Hispanics by 40 points, down from Obama\u2019s 52-point margin last time. Trump won among white voters, 45-42 percent. Clinton racked up a sizable 10-point win among young voters. Seniors split: 49 percent for Clinton, 47 percent for Trump. Roughly six-in-ten Colorado voters were not born in the state. Clinton won these non-natives by seven points. Trump won Colorado\u2019s sizable collection of independent voters by three points. Romney won independents by four points in 2012. Trump was out of step with Coloradans on immigration. By more than four to one, more voters believe illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should have a chance at citizenship (78 percent) than think they should be deported (16 percent). Voters who favor a path to citizenship broke for Clinton by 25 points. Nearly one-third of Colorado voters (31 percent) are angry with the way the government is working these days. These \u201cangry\u201d voters overwhelmingly supported Trump (67-18 percent). Trump also won big among Colorado\u2019s rural voters (+20 points).

            "article_content": "GARDEN CITY, Kan.  \u2013 Law enforcement sought Saturday to reassure immigrants in a diverse western Kansas community of their safety after three men were accused of plotting to target Somali immigrants there. A complaint unsealed Friday charged Curtis Wayne Allen, 49; Patrick Eugene Stein, 47; and Gavin Wayne Wright, 49, with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction in Garden City. The men are members of a small militia group that calls itself \"the Crusaders,\" and whose members espouse sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs, according to the complaint. Prosecutors said the men don't yet have attorneys. The suspects planned to detonate truck bombs around a small apartment complex where about 120 Somali residents live, according to the complaint. Prosecutors also said the men talked about attacking some of the area churches that have helped settle refugees and helped them get jobs at Tyson Foods, the meat packing company that has drawn a diverse immigrant population to the area. Hundreds of Somalians, Malaysians, Burmese and others gathered around FBI agents and law enforcement officers for a briefing early Saturday, The Wichita Eagle reported (http://j.mp/2e3IDfM). \"The only answer I can give you about why this happened is that they wanted to attack your religious beliefs,\" Police Chief Michael Utz said. \"But you need to know that whether you are an immigrant or not, you are all Garden Citians.\" \"Some of you have said you can't go to your mosque to pray, or that you can't go to your homes because you are afraid,\" Utz said. \"But we and the sheriff and the FBI are here to say that you are safe in Garden City, and safe in the United States of America.\" Dalma Ali Warsame, a 34-year-old Somalian, said Somalia had no government \"and no safety,\" which was why he came to the U.S. Now he has a wife and two daughters, ages 1 and 3, who are frightened, as is he. But he says he likes it in Garden City and wants \"to stay a long time. Mahad Jama, a Somalian who works at Tyson, said he has always felt welcomed. \"I see white people at Tyson, at the gas station, everywhere, and everyone is my friend. I don't know what's going on here,\" he said. John Doll, a former Garden City mayor and candidate for the Kansas Senate in the November election, said he was told he was one of the targets discussed by the group. \"This is terrible, because these people they targeted are great people; they work hard, pay taxes, obey the laws,\" he said. \"Why would anyone want to hurt them?\" Debra Bolton has studied the immigrant populations for years, currently for Kansas State University and said 35 languages and dialects besides English are spoken in Garden City schools. Of the 40,000 people in Finney County, only 46 percent are of white European descent, and there are about 500 Somalians, she said. \"This is devastating to the community,\" she said. Mohamad Saufar, a 13-year-old Malaysian Muslim who lives across the street from the targeted apartments, said his mother won't let him play outside now. His 9-year-old sister tried to reassure him. \"Now they are in jail,\" Nurjannah Ezaharhussain said of the suspects. \"And they won't get out until, like, forever!\"",

            "article_content": "In this Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012, photo a new home is constructed in Pepper Pike, Ohio. US home construction surges 12.1 percent in December to end best year since 2008. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak) (AP Photo/Tony Dejak) The 2016 election has been defined so far by immigration, Islamic terror, and economic inequality and the outsider candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders that brought them to the fore. But poor access to housing in America, and the lingering aftereffects of the 2008 housing crash, remains a chief motivator of anger and dissatisfaction amongst an electorate that views the economy and the mortgage market as rigged against ordinary people. My firm recently conducted a comprehensive national study that assessed housing and mortgage access generally, as well as perceptions and policy preferences about government-sponsored mortgage entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac specifically. We found widespread dissatisfaction with access to housing and mortgages in America and a clear perception that a rigged housing system works against ordinary people who can\u2019t borrow money and suffered during the housing crisis. Voters believe that the housing status quo is not working, especially for minorities. They blame banks and the federal government for not supporting policies that advance the interests of homeownership, more affordable housing, more lending. A majority (53%) of American voters believe that \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for people like me to buy a home,\u201d and fully four-in-ten (41%) likely voters agree that \u201cBanks don\u2019t want to provide mortgages to people like me.\u201d In short: Americans believe the housing game is rigged. Even more worrisome is that the sentiment \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for people like me to buy a home\u201d is highest among Hispanic (78%) and black voters (67%), and people of color overall agree with this statement 27 points more than whites. This pervasive dissatisfaction and inequality means something is very wrong in our housing market. It follows that we must ask how voters should approach these deep-seated problems and what policy solutions do they want? The answer, it turns out, is straightforward: empower Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to improve housing access and protect investors who are expanding mortgage access at a time when people struggle to borrow. When asked about the Net Worth Sweep of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal policy that diverts 100% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s profits to the government\u2019s revenue stream, a plurality (47%) of likely voters believe the sweep takes funds that could be used to increase the availability of mortgages, is a violation of shareholder rights. Black voters are most likely to consider the Net Worth Sweep part of a rigged system, with a majority (52%) believing that the sweep is unfair. Further, nearly two-thirds (63%) of likely voters believe the rights of shareholders and investors in mortgage-granting organizations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be protected from the government. Support for shareholder rights is consistently strong across both white voters (64%) and People of Color (62%). Seventy one percent of black voters support shareholder rights over government interests, the highest of any group. Americans demand swift action on housing because the crisis has been devastating to voters who desperately want Congress and the federal government to take steps to ensure housing fairness and help more Americans own homes. Nearly a quarter (23%) of likely voters or their families have lost their home since the 2008 housing crisis, and 43% know someone who has lost their home since the 2008 housing crisis. The desire for policy change is widespread and urgent, with large majorities of voters supporting a new federal approach to housing policy that makes more money available for mortgages and mortgages themselves easier to get. It is clear that housing policy reform, and the desire to empower federal entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help more Americans own homes, is one of the great untold stories and underappreciated drivers of the 2016 election.",

            "article_content": "Former House speaker and top Trump supporter weighs in on 'Fox News Sunday' Donald Trump supporter Newt Gingrich on Sunday sharply criticized the presumptive GOP presidential nominee for his racially-sensitive remarks about the judge presiding over the Trump University civil fraud case. \u201cIt was one of the worst mistakes Trump has made. Inexcusable,\u201d the former GOP House speaker, who has become one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Trump has argued that American-born District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whose parents are from Mexico, is biased against him, considering Trump\u2019s vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out Mexicans. \u201cHe\u2019s Mexican,\u201d Trump told CNN on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall between here and Mexico.\u201d Gingrich, whose is considered a potential Trump running-mate, also called the comment a \u201cmistake\u201d but stopped short of calling it racist. \u201cThat judge is not a Mexican. He\u2019s an American,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it was sloppiness.\u201d Still, Gingrich continued to laud Trump, particularly for the first-time candidate's defeat of 16 other major GOP candidates to win the party nomination. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at his speed, how fast he learns,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cHe\u2019s a remarkable leader. We have a very good relationship.\u201d However, he argued the billionaire businessman is at a \u201cturning point\u201d in which he must become more disciplined and take more of his campaign advisers\u2019 advice if he wants to defeat Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton in the general election. \u201cCompared to Hillary Clinton, I\u2019d support Donald Trump all year,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cShe\u2019s a much more flawed person.\u201d Trump University is the target of two lawsuits in San Diego and one in New York that accuse the business of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach secrets of success in real estate. Trump has maintained that customers were overwhelmingly satisfied. His legal team has not sought to have Curiel removed. Trump on Sunday again defended his comments about the judge and dismissed Clinton\u2019s assertion that his remarks are \u201cracist.\u201d \u201cI have been treated very unfairly by this judge,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d In an extended back-and-forth exchange with host Jake Tapper, Trump acknowledged that Judge Curiel is indeed from Indiana but argued that he\u2019s \u201cvery proud\u201d of his Mexican heritage, to the extent he is a member of a \u201cvery pro-Mexico society.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m building a wall. I\u2019m trying to keep business out of Mexico,\u201d said Trump, suggesting the situation has created a conflict of interest for the judge. He also suggested Clinton should be \u201cput in jail\u201d for using a private email server while secretary of state and called her a \u201cstiff.\u201d Trump, who after a series of terror attack also called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that \"it\u2019s possible\" that a Muslim judge would treat him unfairly. Clinton on Sunday was again critical of Trump\u2019s comments about the judge, which she called inaccurate and \u201cvery vicious.\u201d \"Judge Curiel is as American as I am and certainly as American as Donald Trump is,\u201d Clinton said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d She also suggested that the attacks were \u201ctypical\u201d of Trump\u2019s strategy of trying to \u201cdivert attention\u201d from his problems, in this case \u201cvery serious fraud charges\u201d against the real estate school. \u201cTrump's continuing ethnic slurs and rants against everyone, including a distinguished federal judge, I think makes my point rather conclusively,\u201d Clinton said. Also on Sunday, a pair of powerful Senate Republicans warned Trump to drop his attacks on the judge. \"We're all behind him now,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" adding that it's time for unifying the party, not \"settling scores and grudges.\" \"I hope he'll change his direction,\" the Kentucky Republican also said. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told ABC: \"I don't condone the comments.\" Their remarks solidify the line GOP leaders have drawn in recent days between themselves and Trump, with whom they've made a fragile peace over their sense that almost anyone would be a better president than Clinton. The most-recent GOP pushback against Trump comes two days before presidential primaries in California, home to more Latinos than whites. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan tepidly endorsed Trump -- but 24 hours later disavowed the billionaire's remarks about Curiel. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Woman blamed for hindering arrest of suspect in San Bernardino attack A U.S. immigration official accused in a federal report of hindering law enforcement agents seeking a suspect in the San Bernardino terror attack and then lying about it has been nominated for a prestigious award \u2013 for telling her employees to stay calm and fetching one who was eating lunch in his car. FoxNews.com reported in June that Irene Martin, who heads the San Bernardino U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office, had been nominated for the Department of Homeland Security \u201cAward for Valor.\u201d But the department refused to say what Martin had done to earn consideration for an award previously given to government employees who saved people from sinking ships and burning cars and confronted gun-wielding criminals. The answer was only revealed through a Freedom of Information Act request. As the Dec. 2, 2015, attack unfolded a mile and a half away, Martin \u201cwarned [her] employees to be very careful and to be vigil (sic) about their surroundings,\u201d according to the nominating petition. Irene Martin, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services field boss who clashed with federal law enforcement agents, is shown here in file photo greeting Spc. Brent Kiley, of the US Army\u2019s 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. (Sgt. Giancarlo Casem/Defense Video & Imagery Distribution System) When Martin learned that one member of her staff was sitting in his car after returning from lunch, a security guard refused to go and get him, saying the office was under lockdown. \u201c[Director] Martin took it upon herself to walk out to the parking lot, locate the employee and escort him back inside where he would be safer,\u201d the petition stated, adding that she also soothed members of the public who were temporarily stranded in the building. \u201cMartin\u2019s actions on that terrible day demonstrated not only her professionalism and exceptional leadership, but also her compassion and caring for her employees and the public we serve,\u201d read the nomination. A section on the nominating form for listing \u201cSpecial Honors and Awards for the past 5 years\u201d was left blank. \u201cBasically, Ms. Martin followed standard operating procedures for an emergency situation in the area by addressing the staff, suspending programs and sending everyone home early \u2013 it\u2019s what thousands of supervisors around San Bernardino must have been doing that day,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based research institute. The nomination was made by Martin\u2019s supervisors in Washington on March 3, just over a week before the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth launched his investigation into Martin\u2019s behavior the day after the attack. Roth\u2019s probe found that Martin blocked five armed Department of Homeland Security agents seeking the man authorities now say supplied the firepower in the deadly attack. The report also said she lied to investigators about her actions. Vaughan said she suspects the award nomination was put forward to give cover to Martin, who may have broken the law. \u201cIt certainly appears that the agency is trying to distract from that misconduct by puffing up this incident into an award nomination,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cThe agency leaders appear to believe that egregious poor judgment and a serious act of obstruction can be canceled out by another good deed. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d The DHS award is described as \u201cthe highest departmental recognition for extraordinary acts of valor by an employee or group, occurring while on or off duty\u201d and is reserved for \u201cthose who have demonstrated extraordinary courage in a highly dangerous, life-threatening situation or emergency under extreme stress and involving a specific act of valor, such as saving another person\u2019s life or property.\u201d Martin\u2019s initial actions occurred as Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook killed 14 and wounded 22 at the Inland Regional Center, a social services facility where Farook\u2019s county co-workers were having a Christmas party. Authorities believe Enrique Marquez, who had an appointment with Martin's staff the next day when the authorities showed up, gave the jihadist couple the guns used in the attack. Martin\u2019s role in the next day\u2019s turf war was exposed by unidentified whistle-blowers who went to Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who then requested the Inspector General\u2019s investigation. Roth\u2019s report found Martin improperly hindered the work of five armed agents on site just 24 hours after the attack. It noted DHS agents were sent to the USCIS building to arrest Marquez, who authorities were frantically trying to track down. Marquez, it turned out, had not shown up for his scheduled appointment at the USCIS building, but Martin kept agents waiting 30 minutes before meeting with them, and another hour before she turned over the USCIS file on Marquez. Marquez was eventually arrested and is being held on charges related to supplying the guns as well as marriage fraud. Martin also lied to the Inspector General\u2019s investigators, according to the June 6 report, about her role in what has been characterized as a turf battle. Lying to federal investigators is a felony and can result in dismissal and criminal charges. \u201cWe concluded that the USCIS Field Office Director at the San Bernardino office improperly delayed \u2026 agents from conducting a lawful and routine law enforcement action,\u201d the report stated. \u201cWe have also concluded that the Field Office Director was not candid with OIG investigators during her interview.\u201d",

            "article_content": "How will Donald Trump address these unusual tactics? South of the border, Grupo Beta is seen as a humanitarian organization that steers north-bound migrants through the crossfire of warring drug cartels. But in Texas, many view it as part of a pipeline that sends humans and drugs pouring into the U.S., all with the funding and backing of the Mexican government. Grupo Beta, supported by Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Migration, may be the sole bastion of relief for migrants in Tamaulipas state, across the border from the southeast Texas region which includes such cities as Brownsville, Laredo and McAllen. The 25 year-old agency was created to help Tijuana deal with huge numbers of migrants passing through, but has since expanded its reach across both the northern and southern borders of Mexico. Critics say the agency, whose motto \u201cvocation, humanitarianism and loyalty,\u201d is complicit in breaking U.S. laws. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so much crazy stuff out here,\u201d said Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council. \u201cGrupo Beta was formed with good intention but there have been members of the organization caught smuggling.\u201d Three-quarters of U.S.-bound Central American migrants pass through Tamaulipas, according to Grupo Beta spokesman Luis Carlos Cano. The trail is blazed by the infamous rail line known as \u201cLa Bestia,\u201d which regularly chug northward packed with migrants inside and clinging to the roof under an unyielding sun or monsoon rains. Making the trip even more daunting is the ongoing an indiscriminate war between the Gulf and Los Zetas cartels, which most recently resulted in the massacre of 14 in July in the state\u2019s capital of Ciudad Victoria. Grupo Beta provides medical care, food and essentials for those in need and in transit. Supporters of Grupo Beta acknowledge its blemished history, but say in the current climate of mass migration, it serves a vital purpose. \u201cThere was a time early in the organization's development that they appeared to facilitate smuggling of humans and drugs,\u201d said Victor Manjarrez, Center for Law & Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso, and a former U.S. Border Patrol sector chief. \u201cI don't think that is the case now with the exception of a few rogue instances.\u201d When the organization was first created in Tijuana, Grupo Beta officers carried guns and had law enforcement authority, though it was later stripped by the Mexican government. That, according to Moran, lends itself to looking away or even facilitating crime. \u201cThey lost whatever backing they had so now they have no incentive to contact law enforcement if they come across smugglers because of how powerful the cartels are,\u201d he said, adding that he sympathizes with agents who hesitate to get involved in potentially illegal or violent matters when they have no protection. Cano said that regardless of whether an individual is a drug or human trafficker, if they are in need of medical care Grupo Beta will provide it and will not report them to Mexican authorities. \u201cWe provide the assistance and warn them, but then allow them to be on their way,\u201d Cano said. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask questions or judge, we just provide care.\u201d The danger from cartels is real. In the 2010 San Fernando, Tamaulipas massacre, 72 Central and South American migrants were slaughtered by members of the Los Zetas cartel. Grupo Beta tries to educate migrants traveling through Mexico, and steer them to safety. President Obama\u2019s bi-national campaign to discourage migrants, especially those from Central America expecting automatic residence status in the U.S. on the grounds they are fleeing gangs such as MS 13 in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, has had little impact. According to figures from the U.S. Border Patrol there have been no signs the flood of migrants, especially unaccompanied children, will slow. \u00a0And with the political rhetoric on immigration a focal point of the presidential election, Cano said some may be hoping to make it to the U.S. before policies change. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, from October to May in 2015 there were 13,239 unaccompanied children apprehended just in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. That number skyrocketed to 23,243 over the same time span this year. Mexican officials have seen an increase of more than 50 percent in the number of migrants found in distress since the beginning of 2016 compared to the same period last year. The impact of this increase in migration through Mexico is a mixed blessing. Local economies thrive as peddlers sell supplies to migrants and human traffickers known as \u201ccoyotes\u201d spend some of the estimated $5,000 they reap for each client they spirit into the U.S. Mexico has little economic incentive tightening its border, with more than $40 billion coming back into its economy each year from drug sales, remittances sent back to family from individuals in the U.S., and money spent in the local economies by the migrants as they make their way through Mexico. As in the U.S., it is not illegal to leave Mexico, so once Central and South American migrants enter, the issue is essentially controlled by Grupo Beta, which sees its mission as to ensure safe passage. Efforts have been made by Mexico to control the flow of migrants entering its southern border with little impact. Once they make their way north to the U.S. border, Grupo Beta is ready to help. The do not work with Mexico\u2019s own border officials who are technically tasked with deporting the migrants back to Central America unless they request it. Despite the efforts to mitigate immigration, both the U.S. and Mexico realize they must provide humanitarian help, such as water stations, medical care and shelter when emergencies arise, regardless of the political environment or rhetoric of politicians. On the American side, the U.S. Border Patrol has a special search and rescue unit known as BORTSAR (Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue) whose mission is to rescue lost, ill or injured migrants. In the span of one week from June 13 to June 20, 2016, Laredo Sector Border Patrol alone rescued 87 illegal immigrants. \u201cThe smugglers will leave these immigrants to die,\u201d Mario Martinez, chief patrol agent of the Laredo Sector Border Patrol, said in a press release. \u201cTemperatures will only get hotter and they have to understand that it is a dangerous trek to enter this country illegally.\u201d The 1998 Border Safety Initiative encourages the U.S. Border Patrol to prevent deaths and increase rescues of illegal immigrants who fall prey to \u201ccallous, unscrupulous human smugglers who place them in dangerous situations to fend for themselves with the proviso that these individuals will be processed upon apprehension.\u201d Moran said the Border Patrol\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump came largely on the strength of his pledge to secure the border and stem the flow of drugs and migrants coming across the U.S. border. \u201cMexico does what it wants, when it wants,\u201d Moran said. \u201cMaybe that will change.\u201d",

            "article_content": "AP (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) The historic 2016 election suggests very strongly that despite the relatively close popular vote and somewhat wider, but still significant electoral margin, Democrats need to rethink their politics, policies and approach. The November 8 election result is the rejection of the left of the Democratic party that calls for the redistribution of wealth, free college, a $15 minimum wage and embraces unions to the exclusion of ordinary people. Americans sent a clear signal that they are looking for our nation to project strength in foreign policy, a marquee issue for Donald Trump. But most of all, the outcome reflects a clear sense that the Democratic party cannot and will not be able to win elections unless it moves back to the center of the electorate. I recognize that I am a lonely person. I did make clear during the campaign that I could not vote for Hillary Clinton, but that I am still a Democrat. But I am a Democrat of the Henry Jackson, Warren Magnuson, Hubert Humphrey and Bill Clinton wing. Not the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wing which demonizes corporations and rejects policies that would create jobs and strengthen our economy. I recognize that I am a lonely person. I did make clear during the campaign that I could not vote for Hillary Clinton, but that I am still a Democrat. But I am a Democrat of the Henry Jackson, Warren Magnuson, Hubert Humphrey and Bill Clinton wing. Not the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wing which demonizes corporations and rejects policies that would create jobs and strengthen our economy. The Democrats now have to put aside partisanship and seek to find common ground with Donald Trump on issues like immigration, tax reform on both corporate and individual level and most of all on infrastructure given our crumbling roads, bridges and highways. There is so much more that we can work on together than politicians acknowledge and a majority of Americans have long wished that politicians in Washington would work with one another. Indeed, it will simply alienate voters if the Democrats adopt a policy of extreme confrontation with a new president whom the American people \u2013 whatever their worldview \u2013 want to succeed. The Democrats have to make it clear that they will seek consensus and compromise. For the Democratic party to feel in any way that the closeness of the race is an indication that they should accept the politics of the far left would be a profound mistake. Let me be clear, Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren wouldn\u2019t have won this election. Their agenda does not appeal to Americans. Period. To this end, in one sense, the far left agenda contributed greatly to Secretary Clinton\u2019s loss and it\u2019s certainly one of the reasons that we need a change in the party if we are to return to the strength and ideological and substantive positioning the party achieved in the 1990s when I worked for Bill Clinton. I look forward to big changes for the Democrats that will make us a stronger, more unified party.",

            "article_content": "Martha MacCallum joins 'The O'Reilly Factor' to analyze the exit polling Following his victory in the Indiana primary, Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party for president of the United States. In upcoming days, many of us in the evangelical community will be tempted to be despondent, maybe even to detach ourselves from the political process out of a feeling of helplessness. And yet, we should not despair. Although we have lost the nomination contest, at the same time we surely have won an opportunity to regain our evangelical witness. We must regain our witness. Even if Trump were to have lost the nomination in a contested convention, Evangelicals had already slipped up by supporting the rise of a primary candidate whose campaign is characterized by overheated ethno-nationalistic aggression, who wants to curb free speech, who did not immediately and decisively distance himself from David Duke\u2019s support for his candidacy, who seems only questionably committed to the pro-Life and religious liberty causes, who regularly demeans those who oppose him, and whose rallies have been punctuated by violence and civil unrest. In spite of these things, a certain sector of the Evangelical world\u2014let\u2019s call them Trumpangelicals\u2014support his candidacy. But what about the rest of us, those of us who are Evangelical but cannot countenance the thought of an Evangelical-supported Trump nomination? How do we recover from having allowed within our ranks the rise of Trumpangelism? How should we evangelicals reposition ourselves in order to regain our witness? The 2016 election cycle offers an almost-irreplaceable opportunity for evangelicals to redefine ourselves and regain our witness. The redefinition and regaining must include at least three planks: First, it offers us the opportunity to do something we should have been doing all along: by criticizing both the Democratic and Republican front runners, we can show that Christian wisdom often defies traditional social and political categories such as Democratic and Republican. This type of Gospel-centered Christianity will diminish our culture\u2019s ability to classify and dismiss the church as the religious special interest wing of any one political party. Second, we now have the opportunity and responsibility to speak with a clear voice on a broader array of policy issues. Instead of applying our moral exhortations to the Clintons alone, we can apply them also to a GOP nominee whose words and actions cause us a great deal of moral concern. Instead of applying Jesus\u2019 command of neighbor love exclusively to the unborn, we can demonstrate our love for other persons\u2014immigrants, refugees, those who are financially destitute\u2014by making and stating our policies in ways that are both convictional and compassionate. Third, we can help provide healing for the unhealthy and even toxic nature of American politics and public life. Over the past decade, our public discourse has become increasingly uncivil. For our part, Evangelicals can show the world what it looks like to speak and act with conviction while at the same time doing so civilly. We can take tough stances on issues while refusing to misrepresent, demean, or demonize those who oppose us. We can treat our political opponents as people with whom we disagree rather than as people who should be demeaned and degraded. If we evangelicals are going to regain our voice in upcoming years, we must reposition ourselves as something other than the religious special interest arm of the Republican Party. I am a registered Republican. I\u2019ve voted Republican in every election. But first and foremost, I am a Christian. My allegiance to Christ and the gospel transcends my allegiance to the Republican Party; if and when the GOP\u2019s platform or politicians are at odds with my Christian convictions, I will leverage my Christianity to criticize the party. Let us remind ourselves that these are things we should have been doing all along. We\u2019ve failed to do so consistently or recognizably, and the rise of Trump\u2019s candidacy offers us remarkable and irreplaceable opportunity. The moment has come to seize it.",

            "article_content": "Reaction from Remi Spencer, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor It will again fuel the speculation. The wonder. The whispers. The conjecture may not be fair. But it will inevitably happen. A decision by Washington D.C. Superior Court Judge Robert Morin to \u201cdismiss without prejudice\u201d the murder conviction of Ingmar Guandique is likely to foster enduring chatter theory, which hasn\u2019t dissipated in the nation\u2019s capital in 15 years. In 2010, the feds convicted Guandique -- an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador -- in the murder of then 24-year-old Washington intern Chandra Levy nine years earlier. Now prosecutors appealed to the court to drop the conviction as the court prepared for a retrial this fall because their case against Guandique crumbled. The U.S. Attorney told the court that his office \u201ccould no longer prove the murder case against Mr. Guandique beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Prosecutors based their conviction on the testimony of what later proved to be an unreliable informant who coughed up information from the slammer. Prosecutors halted their efforts against Guandique following the revelation of an illegally-taped conversation between gang leader Armando Morales and bit-part actress Babs Proller. Morales\u2019s information was key in the conviction of Guandique. Morales and Proller got to know each other when they were neighbors. Proller\u2019s recording purportedly reveals he lied on the witness stand during Guandique\u2019s 2010 trial, which earned him a 60-year sentence for murdering Levy. \" 'Homeboy, I killed that bitch, but I didn\u2019t rape her,\u2019 \u201d Morales testified\u00a0in court about what Guandique told him about Levy. Morales asked for installation in the government\u2019s witness protection program for his testimony. \u201cIt is now clear that the jailhouse informant, who was central to the government case, was a perjurer who too easily manipulated the prosecutors,\u201d said Guandique\u2019s attorneys. And so, the question today is the same as it was 15 years ago: Who killed Chandra Levy? The disappearance and murder of Levy has and always will be a Capitol Hill story. That\u2019s because at the time of Levy\u2019s death, she was having an affair with then-Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif. Carnival atmospheres frequently descend on Capitol Hill: Donald Trump meeting with House and Senate Republicans as he did a few weeks ago. A lineup of baseball stars like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa appearing at a hearing on doping. Bono and Alicia Keys cruising through the Capitol\u2019s marble corridors in an effort to secure funding for AIDS research. But no one has seen a journalism jamboree like the one that unfolded around Condit in the spring and summer of 2001. The Levy case engrossed the entire press corps. News crews from around the world encamped on the Capitol. Reporters staked out Condit\u2019s office. They stalked him near the House gym in the Rayburn House Office Building. They pursued him in and out at the House Agriculture Committee. They waited at all hours for Condit at his home in Washington\u2019s Adams-Morgan neighborhood. They even hung out in front of the home of his chief of staff in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va. There were no suspects in the Levy case. But Condit was eerily mute. His quiet fomented disquiet. What did he know? What did he do? Did he do anything? Prosecutors called Condit to testify in the 2010 Guandique case. When Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Haines presented Condit in court, she noted that the former congressman \u201cwas having an affair with Chandra Levy.\u201d She later said those rendezvous had \u201cnothing to do with the murder of Chandra Levy.\u201d But earlier this year, Guandique\u2019s defense team planned to introduce evidence at a retrial that could implicate Condit. \u201cCondit was fully aware of the cost he could pay if his affair with Ms. Levy became public,\u201d said the defense in court filings. \u201cHe therefore had an obvious motive to kill Ms. Levy in order to keep the relationship secret, and an equally powerful motive to cover up the circumstances of her death if she died while she was with him -- either through intentional conduct or otherwise.\u201d Back in 2001, all eyes -- including those of media and law enforcement -- focused on Condit. The case baffled investigators. There was no murder weapon. They found no body (until 2002). No obvious motive. There was cryptic information from Levy\u2019s computer internet searches about the Pierce-Klingle Mansion in the middle of Washington\u2019s Rock Creek Park. In May, 2002, a man searching for turtles (can this get any weirder?) stumbled upon Levy\u2019s skeletal remains. Notably on Levy\u2019s computer, there was also a search for Baskin-Robbins. After leaving Congress, Condit operated two Baskin-Robbins franchises near Phoenix. Baskin-Robbins later sued Condit and his family for failing to pay franchise and advertising fees to the company. Police eventually ruled Condit out as a suspect. He conceded in an interview he had a tryst with a woman who was nearly three decades his junior. But authorities cleared Condit, despite finding him elusive. Flight attendant Anne Marie Smith also came forward, saying she too had an affair with Condit. The congressman then refused to submit to a police polygraph. Is there any reason this story wouldn\u2019t consume media, in Washington or elsewhere? Condit tried to run for re-election. He lost his primary to a former staffer, Rep. Dennis Cardoza, D-Calif. Condit\u2019s son Chad ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2012. Guandique turned to Levy\u2019s parents when he appeared in court six years ago. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for what happened to your daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had nothing to do with it. I am innocent.\u201d And still, no one knows who did it. But one thing is clear: the recording Babs Proller made of Armando Morales is the lynchpin to clearing Guandique. That\u2019s the only reason people in Washington are chattering about this case again. In a final, warped twist, Babs Proller appeared briefly in an episode of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d In a non-speaking role, Proller appears sitting on the dais in the House chamber when President Frank Underwood addresses Congress for his State of the Union message. Proller\u2019s position in the chamber is usually reserved for the clerk of the House during such elite meetings. The entire Chandra Levy case revolves around quintessential Washington intrigue, even 15 years down the road. A congressman\u2019s liaisons with an intern. Power. An unsolved murder. A media circus. All inside the Beltway touchstones worthy of the program, \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d It appears the government formed its case against Guandique on a house of cards. And perhaps it\u2019s only appropriate that an actress who appeared on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d helped immolate the prosecution and the conviction of Guandique. Who killed Chandra Levy? Well, it\u2019s like something right out of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Dozens of environmentally friendly mayors from around the world demanded Tuesday that their national leaders take bold steps at the Paris climate talks this year, saying that may be the last chance to keep the warming of the Earth at levels safe for humanity. Some 60 mayors gathered Tuesday at the Vatican for a two-day climate conference to keep the pressure on world leaders ahead of the Paris negotiations in December and to promote Pope Francis' environmental encyclical, which denounced the fossil fuel-based world economy that exploits the poor and destroys the Earth. The mayors are expected to sign a declaration later Tuesday that states that \"human-induced climate change is a scientific reality and its effective control is a moral imperative for humanity,\" according to the final declaration seen by The Associated Press. In his remarks to the meeting, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced new greenhouse gas emissions targets for the Big Apple and urged other cities to follow suit. \"The Paris summit is just months away,\" De Blasio said. \"We need to see it as the finish line of a sprint, and take every local action we can in the coming months to maximize the chance that our national governments will act boldly.\" De Blasio is a founding member of an alliance of cities around the world that have committed to reducing their emissions by 80 percent by 2050 or sooner. He said New York was taking an interim step, committing to reducing its emissions by 40 percent by 2030. The climax of Tuesday's inaugural session was an afternoon audience with Pope Francis, who has become a hero to the environmental movement and has used his moral authority and enormous popularity to focus world attention on climate change and its effects on the poor. Francis' other main priority has been to raise awareness about human trafficking. The Vatican conference is aimed at showing how both are related: The exploitation of the Earth and its most vulnerable people, with global warming often responsible for creating \"environmental refugees\" forced to flee homes because of drought or other climate-induced natural disasters. \"Addressing both these phenomenon, climate change and modern slavery, is a herculean task for us as city administrators,\" said Tony Chammany, the mayor of Kochi, India. The final declaration calls for financial incentives to transition from using fossil fuels to using low-carbon and renewable energies and to shift public financing away from the military to \"urgent investments\" in sustainable development, with wealthy countries helping poorer ones. And it says political leaders have a \"special responsibility\" at the Paris talks to approve a \"bold climate agreement that confines global warming to a limit safe for humanity, while protecting the poor and the vulnerable from ongoing climate change that gravely endangers their lives.\" Drawing rousing applause in one of the opening speeches, California Gov. Jerry Brown denounced global warming deniers who he said are \"bamboozling\" the public and politicians with false information to persuade them that the world isn't getting warmer. Brown, a former Jesuit seminarian, urged the mayors to not be complacent in opposing climate deniers. California has enacted the toughest greenhouse gas emissions standards in North America. \"We have a very powerful opposition that, at least in my country, spends billions on trying to keep from office people such as yourselves and elect troglodytes and other deniers of the obvious science,\" he said. Stockholm Mayor Karin Wanngaard said the Paris talks must take fossil fuels off the table and focus on other energy sources. Stockholm is one of the world's leaders in using renewable energy sources, with 75 percent of the city's public transport network runs on renewable energy. Wanngaard's goal is to make the Swedish capital fossil fuel-free by 2040. \"Climate negotiators must dare to push boundaries and exclude fossil fuels as an option and reward solutions that are long-term sustainable and renewable,\" she said. Other mayors attending hail from Boston; Boulder, Colorado; Oslo, Norway; San Francisco and Vancouver. Experts have long said that cities are key to reducing global warming since urban areas account for nearly three-quarters of human emissions. In addition to the climate declaration, mayors will be asked to sign a statement against human trafficking that was first penned by religious leaders at the Vatican last year. The conference opened with two tearful testimonies by Mexican women who were trafficked for prostitution and forced labor. \"We are human beings,\" said Ana Laura Perez Jaimes, who told of the 600 scars across her body she suffered when forced to work as a slave.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump answers a question during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (Joe Raedle/Pool via AP) Earlier this year Ahmad Rahami, a naturalized American from Afghanistan, allegedly detonated several bombs in New York and New Jersey. Luckily, these attacks only wounded 31 people. This is but one example of the reality that America is fighting for its life, but most do not understand the gravity of the challenges we face. In fact, the United States is fighting for its existence on three fronts: economic, cultural and physical. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the situation: \u2022 Economic: GDP growth is stagnant at about 1 percent. It should be 3-4 percent. \u2022 Cultural: The American Constitution and way of life are under constant attack from enemies determined to destroy our liberties and our lives. \u2022 Physical: On national security, countless state and non-state actors are working to disrupt our day-to-day existence. We are exposed on all three fronts because political, business and cultural leaders are either na\u00efve, willfully blind or corrupt and complicit in flatlining the economy, allowing our traditions to be trampled over and making our citizens vulnerable to attack. The people who have created this dire situation believe in one or more of these four false narratives: globalism, socialism, isolationism and \u201cPolitical Islam.\u201d The first three narratives have been in the American mainstream for decades, but political Islam is different. Under the guise of a religion, political Islam has penetrated our culture, politics and media. \u201cPolitical Islam\u201d refers to the politicization of Islam. It preaches hate. It demands that non-Muslims must be killed or submit to Islamic law. It calls for global rule and it uses physical, intellectual, financial, legal and demographic means to attain it. To save America and Western civilization, we must defeat Political Islam. We must commit ourselves to destroying the forces that attack us every minute of every day. Here are several policies that would return America to leadership in the world: On the economic front: The government must get out of the way. We must reduce the tax burden on every American citizen and business. All wages should be taxed together under three brackets of 10, 20 and 30 percent. The corporate tax rate should be 20 percent, not 35 percent, which is the highest rate in the developed world. ObamaCare must be repealed and replaced with a plan that increases choice, keeps the government out of the physician-patient relationship and doesn\u2019t crush small businesses. We must stop the government\u2019s intergenerational theft, or our children and grandchildren will never be able to repay the current level of overspending. Lastly, all states must enact energy and right-to-work policies to allow for innovation and investment. On the cultural front: Adherence to core values made America strong. The U.S. must re-instill the values of the Founding Fathers: liberty and opportunity on top of a strong Judeo-Christian base. We must return to the constitutionally dictated balance of power shared by the three branches of government. To revive American exceptionalism, we must defend our freedom of speech against the false narrative of political correctness. Voter fraud must be eliminated. To ensure the integrity of our elections, Americans must be required to have photo identification when going to the ballot box. On the physical front: We must defeat the four leading Political Islamic terror organizations: Shiite Iran, ISIS/al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabism/Salafism. These entities indiscriminately terrorize and kill Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus and all others. In fact, Muslims are the No. 1 victims of Political Islam, as evidenced in Syria, Iraq and Iran. The ideology that feeds these entities must be debunked, and their leaders must be removed. Defeating them must begin by stopping Iran\u2019s radicalism and nuclear agenda, eliminating ISIS/al-Qaeda by any means necessary, rooting out the Muslim Brotherhood in any country where it operates and pressuring Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and Pakistan to reform the jihadist Wahhabism/Salafism ideology. To protect the homeland, we must screen all refugees and immigrants, seal our borders and secure our critical infrastructure by protecting the electric grid from natural disasters, cyber/GPS hacking and electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) attack. The American voter should keep these core issues in mind as we vote on November 8!",

            "article_content": "Senate hearing under way for attorney general nominee Attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch backed up President Obama on his controversial immigration executive actions during her confirmation hearing Wednesday -- while going as far to say she believed in an illegal immigrant's \"right\" and \"obligation to work.\" Lynch, who is in line to succeed Eric Holder if confirmed, fielded a barrage of questions on the opening day of her Senate hearing on the Obama administration's moves to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation and offer them work permits. In a carefully worded response, Lynch told lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee she's read the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and other papers that helped justify much of what the Department of Homeland Security is doing. She said they seem a \"reasonable discussion\" of the law. \"I don't see any reason to doubt the reasonableness of those views,\" Lynch said, adding that the department always must review such matters \"carefully.\" While clarifying it's not her role to \"support or not support\" the legal justification, Lynch went on to back up components of the administration's policy. Under questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who asked whether legal residents or illegal immigrants have more of a right to a job, Lynch said everyone should be able to work. \"I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here,\" Lynch said. \"If someone is here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace.\" She acknowledged there's no civil right in the law for illegal immigrants to get citizenship and that employers still have to abide by the nation's immigration laws. Lynch also said DHS's effort to prioritize deportations by focusing on removing the most dangerous criminals seems a \"reasonable way to marshal limited resources.\" The immigration issue dominated the opening day of the hearing. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the committee, was highly critical of Obama's plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation as he questioned Lynch on the matter. He told Lynch that \"common sense\" would dictate it is \"impossible\" to apply such an exception on such a broad basis. Lynch, while backing the \"reasonableness\" of the legal guidance, repeatedly reminded lawmakers she was not involved in the immigration action review. Republican lawmakers also sought to probe whether Lynch would bring a different style to the leadership of the department than Holder, who has had a contentious relationship with Congress. Grassley, in his opening remarks, said he wants to know if the nominee can \"fix\" the department -- which he called \"deeply politicized.\" Grassley suggested the attorney general post has been used to represent Obama, not necessarily the American people. He complained that legal memos have sanctioned \"the unprecedented authority that [Obama] claims to possess.\" He said those opinions should be impartial. \"They shouldn't be transparently self-serving attempts to justify whatever the president or an attorney general wants to do for political reasons,\" Grassley said. Later on in the hearing, Lynch assured lawmakers: \"If confirmed as attorney general, I will be myself. I will be Loretta Lynch.\" Wednesday's session was the first Republican-led confirmation hearing of the Obama administration, with Republicans in control of the Senate for the first time since Obama took office. If approved, Lynch would become the first black female attorney general. She is now the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Lynch would replace Holder, who announced his resignation in September after leading the Justice Department for six years. Holder was a lightning rod for conservative criticism and clashed with congressional Republicans. By contrast, Lynch has already earned praise from several of the GOP members of the Judiciary Committee and is widely expected to win confirmation. But first she faces tough questions from committee members on immigration, police misconduct and other issues. Grassley's opening statement reflected lingering concerns that the president has taken questionable executive actions and used the Justice Department to help justify them legally. Lynch was also asked early on about the controversy over the IRS targeting Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations when they applied for tax-exempt status several years ago. Addressing some confusion over whether the matter is still being investigated, Lynch said she is \"generally aware that there is an investigation going on.\" Lynch also told lawmakers that, with several states legalizing marijuana, the drug is still illegal under federal law. In her opening remarks, Lynch vowed that the Constitution \"will be my lodestar as I exercise the power and the responsibility of that position.\" She also said fighting terrorism -- preventing attacks and bringing terrorists to justice -- will be the department's primary mission. She said she looks forward to \"fostering a new and improved relationship with this committee, the United States Senate, and the entire United States Congress -- a relationship based on mutual respect and Constitutional balance.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who introduced Lynch to the committee, called the nominee \"eminently qualified\" but said some are trying to drag \"extraneous issues\" into the fray because \"they can't find anything in her record to point to.\" He reminded lawmakers that Obama's immigration policies aren't seeking confirmation: \"Loretta Lynch is.\" Obama nominated Lynch in November 2014 when Democrats controlled the Senate through the end of the year. However, Republicans were able to hold off the confirmation process until they took charge of the Senate in January, as a result of the elections, arguing committee members from both sides needed more time to prepare.

            "article_content": "The state threatening to sue a humanitarian group that wants to bring in refugees against the governor's will Texas filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the federal government in an effort to block six Syrian refugees from resettling in Dallas this week. The lawsuit comes after the International Rescue committee, a nonprofit group, said it would place Syrian refugees in Texas over the objections of Gov. Greg Abbott. Texas hopes to delay the arrival of the refugees at least for a week until a federal judge can hear the challenge. The state said in the lawsuit that the IRC and the federal government have left Texas \u201cuninformed about refugees that could well pose a security risk to Texans.\u201d The White House has said states don\u2019t have the authority to block refugees. The IRC, which was also named in the suit has noted that Syrian refugees are the most security-vetted group of people who come into the U.S. The Obama administration has said the vetting process is thorough and can take up to two years. \u201cWe have been working diligently with the (IRC) to find a solution that ensures the safety and security for all Texans, but we have reached an impasse and will not let the courts decide,\u201d Texas Health and Human Services Commission spokesman Bryan Black told the Dallas Morning-News. Abbott is among more than two dozen governors who have vowed since the November Paris terror attacks to keep Syrian refugees from resettling in their states, expressing fears that militants could plan a terror attack and enter the country under the guise of a refugee. Since the attacks, about 200 refugees have settled in the U.S., including in states where governors have resisted, according to the State Department. The IRC was threatened with a lawsuit by Texas last week. The group said Monday it will still help all refugees in accordance with its obligations under federal guidelines. Texas responded Tuesday with a moratorium on resettlements until the state received \u201call information\u201d on Syrians scheduled to arrive in Texas during the next three months. Texas also urged the State Department in a letter to give them more information about the \u201ceffectiveness of the screening procedures.\u201d In a statement issued Wednesday night, the IRC said it \"has worked in coordination with Texas officials for 40 years \u2014 to the benefit of Texas communities and the refugees we serve. Refugees are victims of terror, not terrorists, and the families we help have always been welcomed by the people of Texas. The IRC acts within the spirit and letter of the law, and we are hopeful that this matter is resolved soon.\" The Justice Department said it would review the complaint after formally receiving it. The White House declined to comment. IRC spokeswoman Lucy Carrigan has said that two Syrian families are expected to arrive in Texas in the next 10 days, including the six who are noted in the lawsuit. Texas currently takes in more refugees than any other state, including about 240 Syrian refugees since 2011. The Dallas Morning-News reports this is the first legal action by a state to block Syrian refugees. The Refugee Act of 1980 dictates that refugee resettlement within the United States is managed by the federal government. State refugee coordinators are consulted by the federal government and the nine refugee resettlement agencies that have contracts with the government, but that consultation is largely to ensure refugees are settled in cities with adequate jobs, housing and social services. Federal courts \u2014 including the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 have upheld that immigration and admission of noncitizens to the United States is a federal responsibility and one managed wholly by the federal government.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump National Doral, Wednesday, July 27, 2016, in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) Donald Trump is pushing back against claims that he might change his stance on illegal immigration. Earlier, he was expected to propose a new approach on Thursday in Colorado; now that speech has been cancelled. Still, there is speculation that, following his meeting with members of a new Hispanic advisory committee over the weekend, he might back off on plans to deport the 11 million people who are in the country illegally. I say, go for it. Mr. Trump\u2019s hard stand on immigration has alienated not only the Hispanic community, but also many moderate Republicans. Though President Obama\u2019s executive action to protect millions from deportation is not popular, most Americans applaud our country\u2019s history of welcoming immigrants. But, most also want secure borders. Also, the deportation notion is an idea that was scorned by many as impractical and inhumane. (I reckoned it would take a bus convoy stretching more than 10,000 miles, or 6 times the distance between El Paso and Canada, to get the job done.) As he has recently laid out some sensible policies on the economy and on law and order, Mr. Trump has begun to recover in the polls. A modulated but intelligent approach to our immigration dilemma offers the GOP candidate a chance for even more progress. Here is a four-step approach that might actually move the needle on immigration. First, allow the 11 million people living in the country without papers an opportunity to achieve legal status. Those who apply and fulfill various requirements, such as having no criminal record and having a credible employment history, would become legal alien residents, which would allow them to work and pay taxes. There are already thirteen million people in the country who have that status; there would be no stigma and it would bring millions out of the shadows. To counter critics who would call this amnesty, or who would charge the approach as unfair to those who have entered the country illegally, stipulate that these legal alien residents would never have a shot at citizenship. This should be acceptable since under today\u2019s policies their children born in the U.S. are automatically citizens. Second, end birthright citizenship. The policy of automatically granting citizenship to every child born on American soil is outdated and harmful. The United States is one of only two advanced countries that still embrace birthright citizenship; most have long ago discarded the practice. We grant citizenship to more than 300,000 babies born to undocumented people in our country every year \u2013 many more than enter each year without papers. We also reward so-called \u201cbirthright tourism\u201d, whereby tens of thousands of women come to the U.S. every year from countries like China and Russia to deliver their babies on U.S. soil. Because of our family-friendly immigration policies, those foreigners know that come hard times in their country, that baby could usher relatives into the U.S. Granting automatic citizenship makes it impossible to close our borders. This prize, worth millions of dollars in benefits over the course of a lifetime, is irresistible. Though it would require an amendment to the constitution, this change should and can be made as part of a bigger deal. In 1993 Senator Harry Reid proposed limiting birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens and legal resident aliens; since then, there have been other attempts to make a change. Third, seal the borders. The Obama administration has claimed that it is impossible to prevent people entering the country illegally. Many would argue they haven\u2019t tried very hard. By its various amnesty proposals \u2013 like the DACA in 2012 or the broader executive order protection millions more from deportation, the White House has encouraged undocumented migrants; the welcome mat is quickly visible thousands of miles away. Obama\u2019s outreach to Cuba has launched another wave of migrants, as people from that country worry the U.S. might jettison our long-standing policy of giving them automatic sanctuary. Also, a judge ruled last year against indefinite detention of people caught crossing the border and ordered them released within a few days. Thousands have simply disappeared into the system; some 15,000 who were denied asylum stayed anyway. The message sent south: the doors are open again. Unless the U.S. prevents people from crossing the border or undertakes a tough policy of deporting those who enter back to their country of origin, we will continue to see the ranks of the undocumented grow. It is impossible to imagine that in this day of drones and advanced surveillance we cannot do a better job. Maybe it takes a wall; maybe not. But this is not an impossible job. Finally, revise our immigration policies so that they attract the best and the brightest people in the world. The United States\u2019 immigration policies are outdated not guided by self-interest. As an example, taxpayers underwrite many of the world\u2019s greatest universities, which attract some of the smartest young people in the world. We then often refuse to allow those highly educated and ambitious graduates to stay in our country. This is stupid. We need to fix this. Trump should take it on.",

            "article_content": "SCOTUS expected to decide on high-profile cases as term comes to a close The Supreme Court is set this week to begin announcing decisions on roughly a dozen remaining cases, including contentious ones on abortion and immigration. The rulings will be released from the bench starting Monday, with the high court typically waiting until the last week of June to announce those on the most contentious issues, in a tradition known as \"spring flood\" and just before the justices go on summer recess. Rulings on this season\u2019s slate of cases were complicated by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia -- leaving the bench with four remaining conservative justices and four liberal ones. \"Eight, as you know, is not a good number for a multi-member court,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recent said. \"That means no opinions and no precedential value; an equal division is essentially the same as a denial of review.\" Such ties mean a default victory for the party that won at the lower court, but only in states covered by that appeals court's jurisdiction. The lack of precedent leaves legal uncertainty nationwide. And the high court could re-argue the case when it operates at full strength with nine members. The court has already deadlocked twice this term, and essentially punted in another high profile case. A challenge by religious-affiliated employers -- including a Catholic charity of nuns --\u00a0to ObamaCare's contraception mandate was sent back to the lower courts. \"The Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\" the unsigned ruling read. The outcome suggested the court lacked a majority for a significant ruling and that it could be a template for other divided cases to be resolved in the coming days. On a pending ruling regarding abortion-clinic restrictions in Texas, Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, see a possible 4-4 decision but thinks the case will come before the court again, in perhaps a year or two. However, some progressives hope the court's so-called \"swing vote\" will break with his conservative colleagues. \"I think all eyes are going to be on Justice [Anthony] Kennedy and I don't think it will split 4-4,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"I think Justice Kennedy will join the more liberal justices to say the Supreme Court has reaffirmed there is a constitutional right for a woman to choose whether or not to have an abortion.\" Both court watchers spoke Sunday to Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent Shannon Bream, on \"America's Election Headquarters.\" Scalia\u2019s unexpected death in February, during a presidential election year, left the court shaken and short-handed, a situation Ginsburg noted wistfully. \"The Court is a paler place without him,\" she said of her best friend on the court. President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland as a replacement, but Senate Republican leaders have vowed that the federal appeals court judge will not get a hearing or floor vote this year. That would leave his successor with an immediate opportunity to shift the court's shaky ideological balance to either the right or left. While public debate over the direction of the nation's highest court continues to animate the presidential race, the court remains notoriously tight-lipped on internal discussions. Still, Chief Justice John Roberts last month told a group of judges he and his colleagues were operating under a new dynamic. \"I try to achieve as much consensus as I can,\" Roberts said. \"We kind of have to have a commitment as a group. I think we spend a fair amount of time-- maybe a little more than others in the past-- talking about things, talking them out. It sometimes brings you a bit closer together.\" Another consequence of the current vacancy is that the court has accepted fewer cases for full review, meaning its fall docket is so far pretty thin. Under court rules, it takes at least four justices to put a case on the argument calendar, and five to ultimately prevail on the merits. But Roberts said a go-slow approach often is best long term. \"I think we should be as restrained in when we decide the issues when it's necessary to do so,\" he said. \"I think that's part of how I look at the job.\" Among the cases yet to be decided: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION:\u00a0 Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. The case could be a definitive, landmark ruling on the use of race in public university admissions. Justice Elena Kagan has already recused, meaning conservatives might have a 4-3 edge to cut back on such policies. Or Kennedy could side with his more liberal colleagues to uphold the school's diversity model. The justices first heard the case three years ago but essentially sidestepped a binding resolution. The court at the time affirmed the use of race in the admissions process but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity. The 7-1 decision avoided the larger constitutional issues. ABORTION ACCESS: Whole Woman's Health v. Cole. The constitutionality of a Texas law requires all clinics performing abortions in the state to be \"ambulatory surgical centers\" and that doctors performing abortions first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority Legislature have said the regulations contained in the 2013 law -- known as H.B. 1 --\u00a0would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups argue the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. Only 10 such health centers would qualify to stay open, and large areas west and south of San Antonio would have no full-time abortion providers. EXECUTIVE POWER:\u00a0 U.S. v. Texas. The case is a multi-state challenge to the president's use of executive power to block certain undocumented aliens from being deported, despite being in the country illegally.\u00a0 A tie decision would essentially be a win for the states, since the lower courts have put the president's programs on hold. At issue is whether as many as 4 million immigrants can be spared deportation -- including many who entered the U.S. illegally as children, or those who are parents of citizens or legal residents. The president's programs -- known as the Deferred Action for Parents of American Citizens and Permanent Residents (DAPA) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) -- effectively went around the Republican-led Congress. Opponents -- including 26 states and GOP members of Congress -- say the White House's broad immigration policy plan exceeds constitutional power. PUBLIC CORRUPTION: McDonnell v. U.S. The case addresses the definition of \"official acts\" that can lead to being prosecuted for public corruption. Virginia's former GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell was convicted of providing favors to a friend and benefactor. In oral arguments from April, a majority of justices appeared poised to void McDonnell's conviction and place new limits on the reach of federal bribery laws. Several on the court, across the ideological spectrum, expressed major concerns that the laws give prosecutors too much power to criminalize the everyday acts that politician perform to help constituents. SEARCH AND SEIZURE: Birchfield v. North Dakota;\u00a0 Bernard v. Minnesota;\u00a0 Beylund v. Levi. The justices are considering the constitutionality of warrantless roadside drunk-driving tests and of assumed consent to such tests. The high court also expressed doubts in oral arguments about laws in at least a dozen states. Drivers prosecuted under those provisions claim they violate the Constitution's 4th Amendment protections. Some states suggested it would be too burdensome in many instances to seek an expedited search warrant every time.",

Trump, speaks during the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Thursday, July 21, 2016. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (The Associated Press) CLEVELAND \u2013 Declaring America in crisis, Donald Trump pledged to cheering Republicans and still-skeptical voters Thursday night that as president he will restore the safety they fear they're losing, strictly curb immigration and save the nation from Hillary Clinton's record of \"death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.\" Confidently addressing the finale of his party's less-than-smooth national convention, the billionaire businessman declared the nation's problems too staggering to be fixed within the confines of traditional politics. \"I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,\" Trump said. The 70-year-old celebrity businessman's acceptance of the Republican nomination caps his improbable takeover of the GOP, a party that plunges into the general election united in opposition to Clinton but still divided over Trump. Underscoring his unorthodox candidacy, Trump doubled down on the hard-line immigration policies that fired up conservatives in the primary but broke with many in his party by promising protections for gays and lesbians. His address on the closing night of the convention marked his highest-profile opportunity yet to heal Republican divisions and show voters he's prepared for the presidency. Ever the showman, he fed off the energy of the crowd, stepping back to soak in applause and joining the delegates as they chanted, \"U-S-A.\" As the crowd, fiercely opposed to Clinton, broke out in its oft-used refrain of \"Lock her up,\" he waved them off, and instead declared, \"Let's defeat her in November.\" Yet he also accused her of \"terrible, terrible crimes\" and said her greatest achievement may have been avoiding prison for her use of a private email and personal server as secretary of state. The more than hour-long speech was strikingly dark for a celebratory event and almost entirely lacking in specific policy details. Trump shouted throughout as he read off a teleprompter, showing few flashes of humor or even a smile. He accused Clinton, his far-more-experienced Democratic rival, of utterly lacking the good judgment to serve in the White House and as the military's commander in chief. \"This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,\" he said. \"But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.\" In a direct appeal to Americans shaken by a summer of violence at home and around the world, Trump promised that if he takes office in January, \"safety will be restored.\" As he moves into the general election campaign, he's sticking to the controversial proposals of his primary campaign, including building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border and suspending immigration from nations \"compromised by terrorism.\" But in a nod to a broader swath of Americans, he said young people in predominantly black cities \"have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America.\" He also vowed to protect gays and lesbians from violence and oppression, a pledge that was greeted with applause from the crowd. \"As a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said,\" he responded. Trump was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, who announced a childcare policy proposal that the campaign had not mentioned before. \"As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in place at a time when women weren't a significant portion of the workplace, and he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all,\" she said. Trump took the stage in Cleveland facing a daunting array of challenges, many of his own making. Though he vanquished 16 primary rivals, he's viewed with unprecedented negativity by the broader electorate, and is struggling in particular with younger voters and minorities, groups GOP leaders know they need for the party to grow. The first three days of this week's convention bordered on chaos, starting with a plagiarism charge involving his wife Melania Trump's speech and moving on to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's dramatic refusal to endorse him from the convention stage. Then, Trump sparked more questions about his Oval Office readiness by suggesting in the midst of the convention that the U.S. might not defend America's NATO partners with him as president. The remarks, in an interview published online Wednesday by The New York Times, deviate from decades of American doctrine and seem to reject the 67-year-old alliance's bedrock principle of collective defense. Trump reinforced his position from the convention stage, saying the United States has been \"picking up the cost\" of NATO's defenses for too long. He also disavowed America's foreign policy posture under both Democratic and Republican presidents, criticizing \"fifteen years of wars in the Middle East\" and declaring that \"Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\" \"As long as we are led by politicians who will not put 'America First,' then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect,\" he said. He had promised to describe \"major, major\" tax cuts. But his economic proposals Thursday night were vague, centering on unspecified plans to create millions of jobs. He promised a \"simplified\" tax system for the middle class and businesses, fewer regulations and renegotiation of trade deals that he says have put working class Americans at a disadvantage. At every turn, Trump drew sharp contrasts with Clinton, casting her as both unqualified for the presidency and too tied to Washington elites to understand voters' struggles. Democrats will formally nominate Clinton at their convention next week in Philadelphia. She is on the verge of naming a running mate to join her in taking on Trump and his vice presidential pick, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in the general election. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine has emerged as her top choice. ___ AP writers Kathleen Hennessey, Josh Lederman, Alan Fram and Thomas Beaumont in Cleveland, and John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate Supreme Court appointments, Second Amendment rights and reproductive rights At Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas, Donald Trump showed us that he does know how to prepare for a debate. He just should\u2019ve done it sooner. The evening was by far and away his best performance. Trump hit on all the major themes that his campaign is built upon: economic growth, strong national security, fighting illegal immigration, changing the direction of the country by fighting special interests, corruption and bureaucracy as well as ensuring a Conservative Supreme Court. He had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama\u2019s failed policies at home and abroad. He no doubt took a page out of his running mate Mike Pence\u2019s playbook -- who performed so well in the vice presidential debate just a few weeks ago. Trump had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama\u2019s failed policies at home and abroad. He didn\u2019t go off on too many tangents and while Clinton dished out plenty of red meat to get him to explode, he stayed out of the fray more or less. Trump was certainly more frustrated in the second half of the debate than in the first when he was relatively calm, but this wasn\u2019t close to the explosive Trump we saw in the first debate. It\u2019s just unfortunate that he chose to challenge the veracity of the democratic process in America because that may well be the only thing people remember about this debate. Indeed, when Trump said that he won\u2019t necessarily accept the results of the election he made history as the first major party candidate to say something like this before an election. And history will always look back on this with horror. Not only are Trump\u2019s claims about election rigging unfounded \u2013 studies have shown that 31 instances of voter fraud out of a billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014 \u2013 but they\u2019re incredibly dangerous and preview serious unrest after the election. Comments like this also show why Donald Trump didn\u2019t do anything to turn around the race this evening. He has been bleeding support from white college educated women who are certainly not going to be heading back into his camp after he called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d and told a series of lies about his treatment and statements about women. I also don't see much in his performance that will appeal to independent swing voters who have been moved over to Clinton\u2019s camp because of questions on his judgment and temperament. Saying that he won\u2019t necessarily accept the results of the election does him no good in that arena. And for her part, Clinton was exactly what she needed to be. She was reliable, steady and knowledgeable. She gave strong answers on making the economy work for average Americans and hit him hard on his taxes, foundation and economic plan which would cost America over three million jobs and add trillions to the debt. She was weak on her response to moderator Chris Wallace\u2019s question on her Goldman Sachs speech wherein she said that she wanted a common market by pivoting to Russian hacking. But then again, at this point, it\u2019s only Trump\u2019s base that really cares about these issues. The untrustworthy numbers are baked in and Clinton is still leading by six to eight points. And that is unlikely to change. It follows that we may very well have seen the end of the election on Wednesday night. Trump needed to expand past his base and he most certainly did not do that. All he did was force Republicans to come out in defense of the democratic system in the coming days. That doesn\u2019t win elections.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal appeals court on Friday blocked Kansas, Georgia and Alabama from requiring residents to prove they are U.S. citizens when registering to vote using a national form. The 2-1 ruling is a victory for voting rights groups who said a U.S. election official illegally changed proof-of-citizenship requirements on the federal registration form at the behest of the three states. People registering to vote in other states are only required to swear that that they are citizens, not show documentary proof. The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia acted swiftly in the case, issuing a two-page, unsigned ruling just a day after hearing oral arguments. A federal judge in July had refused to block the requirement while the case is considered on the merits. The League of Women Voters and civil rights groups argued that the requirements could lead to the \"mass disenfranchisement\" of thousands of potential voters \u2014 many of them poor, African-American and living in rural areas The groups took issue with the actions of Brian Newby, executive director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, who changed the federal form shortly after he took the job last November. Newby is a former Kansas election official who had publicly supported the state's effort to make the change. The case now returns to the district court for a full hearing on the merits. But the appeals court said the voting rights groups are likely to succeed on the merits. The change requires people seeking to register to show birth certificates, naturalization papers or other documents as proof of citizenship. Kansas has been actively enforcing the requirement, but Alabama and Georgia have not. Opponents said Newby had no authority to take the action on his own. Even the Justice Department has refused to defend Newby's action and has sided with voting rights groups. The appeals court's ruling requires the commission to immediately remove the proof-of-citizenship requirement from all forms. It requires the states to treat all registration applications filed since January 29 as if they did not have the requirement. Judges Judith Rogers and Stephen Williams were in the majority and Judge A. Raymond Randolph dissented. Rogers was a Democratic appointee, while Williams and Randolph were appointed by Republican presidents. The EAC was created in 2002 to help avoid a repeat of the disputed 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore following ballot confusion in Florida. It is supposed to have four commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, but one of the Democratic seats is currently vacant. The remaining commissioners never acted to approve or disapprove Newby's action. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach had argued that the change was needed to prevent voter fraud. He rejected claims that the requirement undermined voter registration, saying Kansas voter rolls have risen overall this year.",

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) I keep hearing Ted Cruz conservatives dissing Donald Trump. I keep seeing the idiotic slogan #NeverTrump. I have a message for all of you: Stop your whining and childish hissy fits. Stop the distortions of Trump\u2019s record. Of course Trump is better than Hillary. Of course all Republicans need to unite behind Trump. Of course he\u2019s a conservative. I\u2019ll prove it to you. I\u2019m one of you. I\u2019m a true-blue lifelong conservative patriot. I\u2019ve been a \u201cCruz conservative\u201d my whole life. Except in my day it was called \u201cReagan conservative.\u201d My conservative credentials cannot be challenged. My parents were among the founders of the famous New York State conservative Party. My political career began at age 3 handing out literature for Barry Goldwater. I spent my youth working on political campaigns for victorious conservative heroes like U.S. Senator James Buckley, U.S. Senator Alphonse D\u2019Amato and President Ronald Reagan. I represented Reagan in the campus Presidential debate at Columbia University. I\u2019ve sacrificed my TV career being an outspoken conservative in Hollywood. My conservative beliefs have cost me millions of dollars. Enough credentials and credibility for you? So are you ready for my takeaway of all this? 1. Trump isn\u2019t just conservative. On important issues, he\u2019s the most conservative Presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan. 2. Trump is the perfect candidate to lead the conservative movement. 3. Trump is our generation\u2019s Reagan. How do I come to these conclusions? First, remember the famous saying \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d Please stop saying Trump isn\u2019t a conservative. He may not be a \u201cpure\u201d or perfect conservative. On that I agree. But his views on the important issues of our day drive liberals into fits of rage and insanity. Being Jewish, Ivy League educated and in the television and entertainment industries my whole life, I know a thing or two about liberals. I\u2019ve spent my whole life in liberal circles: Manhattan, Malibu, Hollywood, Columbia and Harvard. The last person I saw despised this much by liberals was Ronald Reagan. The similarities are remarkable. My hero Reagan drove liberals batty. He drove them into fits of apoplectic rage. Today I see the same reaction to Trump. Liberals hate Trump with such rage that they want to hurt him. They want to ruin him. They even openly want to see him assassinated. Or haven\u2019t you seen the thousands of online and social media comments from liberals hoping Trump gets shot? Or haven\u2019t you seen the cemetery headstone \u201cR.I.P. Donald Trump\u201d put up in New York\u2019s Central Park? Liberals call Trump the same names and descriptions as they used to call Reagan. They say he\u2019s an intellectual lightweight, clown, racist, extreme, stupid, ignorant, unqualified to be President, and of course, we can never allow his finger near the nuclear button. Don\u2019t forget \u201cHitler and Nazi.\u201d The exact same words that my ultra-liberal classmates at Columbia used to describe Reagan. So I ask you fellow conservatives\u2026isn\u2019t this a good sign? Shouldn\u2019t you like the guy that liberals hate? If they think Trump is a terrible person and bad for America, shouldn\u2019t you embrace him? If liberals despise Trump so much they are threatening to leave for Canada, shouldn\u2019t we all thank God for Trump and offer to pay for their plane tickets? \u201cThe enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d You may think Trump is not a conservative, but liberals are certain he\u2019s their enemy. They're sure certain he\u2019s a conservative. They\u2019re certain he\u2019s the worst thing since Reagan. That makes Trump my hero. That makes Trump one of my favorite conservative candidates of all time! Secondly, I agree Trump is not a pure or traditional conservative. That\u2019s why he can win this election vs Hillary Clinton. Again, this is where Trump intersects with Reagan. Reagan was an entertainer, showman and communicator, more than a conservative. Trump is the perfect mix to win this election- entertainer, showman, businessman, celebrity, reality TV star and our very own \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d He\u2019s exactly what the doctor ordered for conservatives. A pure conservative position on every issue is never going to win national elections in today\u2019s America. We need a conservative, mixed with populist and economic nationalist- always America first, presented \u00a0in a fun, entertaining way. That\u2019s Trump. Lastly we come to issues. I care about seven of them above all else. These are the seven issues that can instantly save America, capitalism, the U.S. economy and the middle class. Everything and anything else is a distraction, all other issues must be put on the back-burner. On these seven issues, Trump is as conservative as any candidate in modern history! These are the seven issues that matter above all others to this conservative and capitalist evangelist: 1. Taxes. Trump\u2019s flat tax plan lowers tax rates even lower than Reagan. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 2. Regulations. As a businessman I think regulations are even worse than taxes. Our entire economy and middle class jobs have been decimated by Obama\u2019s regulations. Trump is a businessman. He hates regulations. He\u2019ll dramatically reduce and cut regulations and regulatory agencies (like the EPA)\u00a0 in order to get the economy moving again. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 3. ObamaCare. Trump wants to repeal and replace Obamacare and give Americans more health freedom. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 4. Build the wall, secure the border and end sanctuary cities. Need I say more- this is Trump\u2019s signature issue. His views on illegal immigration define perfection. If he does nothing as president but stop the flow of illegal immigration, he\u2019ll be remembered as an American hero. Just this one point can save the American economy from bankruptcy, ruin and crippling debt crisis. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 5. Stop the insanity of allowing in thousands of Syrian refugees and Muslim migrants. Why is this so important? So that we don\u2019t become the EU- bankrupt, suffering crime and rape epidemics, and experiencing nonstop terrorist attacks. This view isn\u2019t just conservative- it\u2019s commonsense and self-preservation. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 6. Always \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Every single policy- domestic, foreign, trade and immigration- should be based on what\u2019s best for America, American citizens, American taxpayers, and American jobs. I\u2019ve waited my entire life to hear these words come out of a potential president\u2019s mouth. The only job of an American president is to take care of America and Americans first, second, third and forever. How can you get more patriotic or conservative than that? FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 7. Investigate and prosecute politicians who commit crimes against the American people. What if the only thing Trump accomplishes is clean up the D.C. cesspool, hold politicians accountable and bring criminals to justice? What if he sends Hillary to prison for her crimes? What if he prosecutes top IRS officials who targeted and persecuted conservatives? What if he prosecutes Obama\u2019s bundler Jon Corzine? What if he prosecutes everyone involved with the fraud of Obamacare? You mean that alone isn\u2019t worth the price of admission? FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. Yes, folks Donald Trump is a conservative. No, not a pure or perfect conservative. But on the issues that count most, he\u2019ll be the most conservative president since Reagan. How can I be so sure? Just mention Trump\u2019s name to any liberal and watch their reaction. So yes, I have a message for all Republicans and conservatives. Stop listening to the whiners, complainers and sore losers. Stop listening to establishment big shots angry that GOP voters told them to \u201cshove it where the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d Stop listening to consultants, strategists, lobbyists and donors angry that Trump has left them out of the game. Listen to me carefully Republicans... If you don't vote for Trump, you should never be trusted again.",

            "article_content": "Fox News anchor Dana Perino, her husband Peter McMahon and their dog Jasper (Courtesy of the author) Editor's note: Thursday, voters in the UK went to the polls to decide whether to remain in the European Union or leave it. In an historic decision British voters decided to exit the union. Fox News anchor Dana Perino talked with her husband Peter McMahon about this week's \"Brexit\" vote. Here's her conversation with him. 1. Dana: What is your reaction to the Brexit? You said you reluctantly came to the view that Brexit was better for the UK. Why? Peter: I say reluctantly because I know that\u00a0there will be a can of worms to deal with commercially and\u00a0financially. However, I believe that the principle of having self-determination is more important. When the UK joined the European Economic Community there were definite trading benefits; however when that evolved into\u00a0increasing political control from\u00a0Brussels, with laws and regulations being imposed on Britain, in my eyes it became too much. 2. From your point of view, what are the top driving reasons for the people of Britain wanting to leave? I believe the main reason is that the population wanted to have greater control over what the UK can do and its\u00a0direction. I would compare this to how U.S. citizens would feel if\u00a0the NAFTA morphed into a political union of Canada, Mexico and\u00a0the USA, governed by\u00a0representatives of all three countries (where the other two countries had a greater combined vote than\u00a0the U.S.) and based in Mexico City. 3. Why should we (Americans -- that includes you!) care? How does this impact us, if at all? There will be trading issues now since the UK will no longer be a part of what used to be known as the \"Common Market.\" However, there is no reason why trading should be any more\u00a0of a problem with the UK than it is with numerous other non-EU countries. 4. What is the greatest immediate challenge Britain will have to overcome as a result of the Brexit? Confidence in the sterling pound and the FTSE. The trading and tariff issues will not happen overnight.\u00a0There has been a lot of saber rattling by other EU countries, but they will recognize that their own interests lie in sensible cooperation. 5. There is a statistic being circulated that states, \"66 percent of people who left school at 16 voted for Leave; 71 percent of those with university degrees voted to Remain.\" What does America get wrong about that statistic? Going back 40 years, a large number of people were\u00a0well-educated at the high school level but never attended university. In those days, attaining the required qualifications for university often led to direct employment for on-the-job training, as a bank manager, an accountant, or for instance, a career as an officer in the military or\u00a0the merchant marine. As of today approximately 27 percent of the adult population between 21-74 have a university degree; many of those without are highly paid and experienced professionals. The statistic quoted leaves out a large percentage of\u00a0the general population who did not leave school until 18 but did not obtain a degree, so it is not an accurate representation. 6. What does this mean for the United States\u2019 relationship with Britain? What do you think of President Obama\u2019s response this morning? Somewhat different from his orchestrated \"Back of the queue\u201d comments of a few weeks ago that merely served to irritate a lot of British people. Of course\u00a0the relationship will endure -- it did not change when Britain entered the EEC in 1973. 7. Do you agree with Trump that anger with the government\u2019s failure to control immigration was a key factor in this decision? Do you see a commonality between the Brexit motivations and the current immigration bickering within the U.S.? There is some truth in what he says. The areas of the UK where the economy is less strong are struggling to cope with\u00a0the costs of immigration and [these] are the [same] areas that voted most strongly for Brexit. However, I see it as different to the U.S. argument. The British did not want the European Parliament dictating to them what their immigration policy should be with no regard to their ability to handle it. The UK is regarded as a\u00a0\u2018soft touch\u2019 for immigrants -- which is why so many supposedly desperate refugees\u00a0travel thousands of miles to get there; Brexit will allow the UK to decide for themselves just\u00a0what they can and can\u2019t handle. 8.\u00a0What lessons can we learn from Prime Minister Cameron\u2019s leadership in this instance? That he had\u00a0the courage of his convictions and did his best for what he believed was right. His resignation speech was gracious in defeat and patriotic. Though if he had toned down his rhetoric and threats which in some cases was almost bordering on hysteria, he may kept greater\u00a0credibility in his arguments [and might even] have swung the couple of percent more of voters that he needed. 9. Do you think any of the UK countries will go to the finals in the European Football Championship playing out this week? Nope. But then we are\u00a0accustomed to that.",

First reported by the NYT, the cashiering of the Pentagon boss comes after \u201cthe two men mutually agreed\u201d that it was time for the highest profile Republican in Obama\u2019s cabinet to go. But given the fact that the White House was the one pushing out the story, it seems more likely that the president had grown tired of the ongoing pressure from Hagel and members of the top brass to take a more aggressive stance on national security threats abroad. The conflict went public back in August when Hagel openly contradicted White House talking points on the threat posed by Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria. While Obama succumbed to the pressure, Hagel\u2019s ouster shows the president seeking to reassert control over his foundering foreign policy. [Who will replace? - NYT: \u201cAt the top of the list are Michele Flournoy, the former undersecretary of defense; Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and a former officer with the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne; and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of defense.\u201d]Fault finding - Democrats blame disaffection among base voters for the party\u2019s historic defeat earlier this month. And, to be sure, there has not been much for liberals to cheer in Obama\u2019s foreign policy of late. Not only has the president begrudgingly escalated the war against Islamists, the administration has quietly accepted defeat in the president\u2019s bid to get all fighting forces out of Afghanistan. The \u201cendless war\u201d foreign policy combined with stunning revelations about Obama\u2019s expansion of domestic surveillance sent the president\u2019s approval ratings on national security \u2013 once stratospheric after the killing of Usama bin Laden \u2013 to a series of new lows. And among no group was the decline more evident than with Democrats. Given the centrality of Obama\u2019s dovish foreign policy to the building of his coalition, even the reluctant, half-hearted hawkishness of 2014 might be seen as a key culprit by Democrats in the party\u2019s losses. [The good times - Obama often touted his friendship with Hagel as evidence of bipartisan bent, with the right kind of Republican.]That was then - Hagel, who became a hero to Democrats for his relentless criticism of fellow Republican President George W. Bush during the Iraq war, apparently still proved too hawkish for the president and his supporters. That Hagel\u2019s team was recently expressing confidence that he would serve through the end of the president\u2019s term suggests that this reordering came as something of a surprise. Given the harsh critiques of Obama\u2019s other top foreign policy advisers, Hagel\u2019s replacement will be a fraught business. And with the ongoing struggles of Obama\u2019s foreign policy, the debate could further divide Democrats on the most volatile issue for the party and its hawkish 2016 frontrunner.IRAN NUKE TALKS MISS DEADLINEAP: \u201cNuclear negotiators have failed to meet a Monday deadline for a deal that would ease international concerns about Iran\u2019s atomic program and are poised to extend the negotiations for a comprehensive agreement until July 2015, diplomats said. Under the terms of limited agreements reached after a frenetic six days of talks in Vienna, a political accord is to be completed by March 1, with final details contained in annexes to be sealed by July 1, the diplomats said\u2026.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said it \u2018was not possible to meet the deadline\u2019 due to wide gaps on well-known points of contention, including levels of uranium enrichment and the number of centrifuges Iran would be allowed to operate.\u201d [Jerusalem Post: \u201cIsrael has issued a stark, public warning to its allies with a clear argument: Current proposals guarantee the perpetuation of a crisis, backing Israel into a corner from which military force against Iran provides the only logical exit.\u201d]Warren in Tel Aviv with Bibi on deadline day - Jerusalem Post: \u201cWhile it is two full years before the 2016 US presidential race, the parade of possible candidates to Israel began Monday afternoon with a meeting by Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Warren, whose name has been mentioned as a possible challenger to Hillary Clinton for the democratic nomination, arrived Saturday in Tel Aviv, and will also visit Ramallah and Amman. This is the first trip abroad for the senator, elected in 2012 and who has so-far concentrated largely on US domestic issues.\u201d [Washington Free Beacon: \u201cIran\u2019s foreign minister and lead negotiator in nuclear talks is known to frequently scream and shout at Western diplomats, including Secretary of State John Kerry, a practice that has caused alarm\u00a0among bodyguards stationed outside the negotiating room, according to a member of the Iranian diplomatic\u00a0team who spoke to the\u00a0Farsi-language press.]RAND CALLS FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST ISISNYT: \u201cSenator\u00a0Rand Paul\u00a0[R-Ky.] is calling for a declaration of war against the Islamic State, a move that promises to shake up the debate over the military campaign in Iraq and Syria as\u00a0President Obama\u00a0prepares to ask Congress to grant him formal authority to use force. Mr. Paul, a likely presidential candidate who has emerged as one of the Republican Party\u2019s most cautious voices on military intervention, offered a very circumscribed definition of war in his proposal, which he outlined in an interview on Saturday. He would, for instance, limit the duration of military action to one year and significantly restrict the use of ground forces. Unlike other resolutions circulating on Capitol Hill that would give the president various degrees of authority to use force against Islamic militants, Mr. Paul would take the extra step of declaring war \u2014 something Congress has not done since World War II. The president has said he will ask Congress for the explicit authority to fight the Islamic State, though administration officials have insisted that he has the legal power to continue the current campaign.\u201dPaul strengthens McConnell ties with fundraiser hire - National Review: \u201c[Sen.] Rand Paul [R-Ky.] is bringing on [Sen.] Mitch McConnell\u2019s [R-Ky.] national finance director, Laura Sequeira, to play a key fundraising role at his political-action committee ahead of an expected 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d [Flashback: \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a very tight relationship, and I\u2019m for him\u2026I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a final decision on that. But he\u2019ll be able to count on me.\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell in a post-electioninterview.]Air freshener - NYT: \u201cRepublicans also confront a generational decision: They have several energetic governors and senators in their 40s and early 50s lining up to run. \u2026Democrats have had their share of intergenerational battles, but this is relatively new terrain for Republicans. With the exception of George W. Bush, every Republican nominee since 1976 has been over 60.\u201dPoll: No GOP frontrunner in N.H. - Among the tightly packed pool of contenders on the Republican side, a new Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm New Hampshire poll ties Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., at 16 percent each. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., follows close behind at 14 percent. The remaining potential candidates remain further behind with less than 10 percent each. When 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney is added, he jumps way ahead of the field at 30 percent. While on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton enjoys a substantial lead at 62 percent over her next closest competitor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at 13 percent.Carson gets warm welcome from Iowa evangelicals - USA Today: \u201cDr. Ben Carson, a prominent retired neurosurgeon widely mentioned as a\u00a0prospective 2016 presidential candidate, got a warm and enthusiastic reception Saturday night from a key group of Iowa Christian conservatives\u2026Carson pulled no punches in his hour-long remarks, affirming his support for traditional marriage and opposition to abortion while criticizing the Affordable Care Act and President Obama's plans to allow up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to remain in the country.\u201dIG report could dog Kasich - Mark Tapscott reports: \u201cOhio Gov. John Kasich is often mentioned as a potential 2016 Republican presidential hopeful, but there could be an unexpected roadblock for him, a new Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report said. \u2018Although Ohio took steps in recent years to improve its management of funds awarded under the Homeland Security Grant Program, [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] cannot be assured that Ohio effectively managed grant funds from fiscal years 2010 through 2012,\u2019 the IG said\u00a0in a report made public\u00a0Nov. 18, 2014.\u201d OBAMA: VOTERS WANT \u2018NEW CAR SMELL\u2019 IN CANDIDATE, BUT 22-YEAR VETERAN HILLARY WOULD BE \u2018GREAT\u2019Fox News: \u201c[President Obama] says voters want a \u2018new car smell\u2019 in the 2016 White House race and that [Hillary Clinton] would be \u2018a great president.\u2019 But would Clinton pass that particular smell test? In a nationally televised interview broadcast Sunday, Obama seemed to suggest that any Democrat other than him would provide the turn of the page that he says voters are interested in. He acknowledged the \u2018dings\u2019 to his own political standing during nearly six years of sometimes bruising battles with Congress and said Americans will want something new. \u2018They want to drive something off the lot that doesn't have as much mileage as me,\u2019 Obama said in the interview with ABC's \u2018This Week,\u2019 which was taped Friday in Las Vegas following a public appearance there by the president.\u201d [Ed. note: And she\u2019s \u201clikable enough\u201d to boot!

The Atlantic explores the birth of the delicious single servings of mozzarella that inhabit lunch boxes and bags for Americans young and old. As it turns out, there\u2019s nothing magical (or synthetic) about getting the mild mozzarella into its stringy state, just a different handling and packing process. The magazine follows the trail to \u2013 where else? \u2013 Wisconsin to discover how it all began. \u201cFrom its humble three- to five-inch length origins, Baker Cheese quickly designed a stick that was thinner, more holdable, and lighter (current string cheese clocks in at 28 grams; prehistoric string cheese was in the 40 to 45 gram range). That was in 1976. But it wasn\u2019t until the a few years later, when string cheese had become cylindrified from its original twisted rope state and retail opportunities abounded, that string cheese catapulted from a local oddity to a national craze that caught on with the younger set.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Mary Landrieu, his opponent in Louisiana\u2019s hotly contested Senate runoff\u2026Obama\u2019s executive order puts Landrieu in a difficult position. It reminds voters in Louisiana, a conservative state where Obama is widely disliked, that the president and Landrieu belong to the same party. Landrieu, the underdog in the Dec. 6 runoff against Cassidy, would prefer that voters focused on other things. She has worked to distance herself from the president, particularly on energy, apparent in her recent, unsuccessful effort to push legislation through the Senate to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

The factory was the home of the Bronco from 1966-1986, and built trucks until a few years ago, when Ford started producing small cars there in conjunction with a $5.9 billion Energy Department loan for fuel efficient vehicles. Ever since Ford announced it was bringing new vehicles to the facility, rumors have been swirling that they would be a new Ranger small pickup and a Bronco SUV based on it, but Johnson is the first person who likely knows for sure that\u2019s said it out loud.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on developments in the presidential campaign, including Donald Trump's meetings Thursday with House Speaker Paul Ryan and with other congressional leaders: (all times local): 12:15 p.m. Former House Speaker John Boehner is getting behind Donald Trump, despite disagreeing with Trump's stands on banning Muslims from entering the United States, tearing up trade deals and other issues. Boehner (BAY'-nur) says the billionaire businessman is the presumptive Republican nominee for president \u2014 \"whether people like it or not.\" And Boehner is confident that Trump can win in November \u2014 over likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \"Anyone who thinks Donald Trump can't win \u2014 just watch.\" That's how Boehner put it during remarks Thursday at a conference of finance industry leaders in Las Vegas. Boehner spoke not long after House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Trump in Washington. Boehner thinks Ryan is probably \"trying to help shape the direction of Trump's policies.\" Boehner \u2014 who was speaker before Ryan \u2014 says he doesn't \"doubt there will be a meeting of the minds.\" ___ 11:50 a.m. The highest-ranking woman in the House GOP leadership calls the meeting with Donald Trump a \"very important first step\" toward unifying Republicans. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state says Thursday's meeting was the first chance for her to make clear to the presumptive presidential nominee this core value for the party: \"Dreaming big for everyone and turning its back on no one.\" ___ 11:40 a.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he was \"very encouraged by what I heard from Donald Trump\" in their much-anticipated meeting. The Wisconsin lawmaker \u2014 who's has yet to say he's ready to back the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 says \"it's not a secret\" that the two have had \"our differences.\" Ryan says at a news conference after the meeting that the big question is \"what do we need to do to unify the party.\" He says they're \"planting the seeds\" to accomplish that goal. ___ 11:25 a.m. The head of the committee to elect Republicans to the House says he may disagree with Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies, but that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is a better White House option than front-running Democrat Hillary Clinton would be. Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon says in a statement that he intends to support the GOP nominee. Walden's statement came out shortly after other House Republican leaders met with Trump at Republican Party headquarters on Capitol Hill. Walden says the last thing he wants is to give Democrats another four years in charge in the White House. ___ 11:15 a.m. Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan say they had a productive meeting and see a great chance to unite the Republican Party and win the presidential election in November. The presumptive GOP nominee and the party's top elected official said in a statement after their meeting on party headquarters on Capitol Hill that they are \"totally committed to working together\" to achieve that goal. They say they were \"honest about our few differences\" but also recognize \"many important areas of common ground.\" More discussions are promised, but this first one was described as \"a very positive step toward unification.\" Ryan has yet to come out in support of Trump. But the two say it's critical for Republicans to united around \"our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda and do all we can to win this fall.\" ___ 10:55 a.m. Donald Trump has wrapped up his meeting with House Republican leaders, including Speaker Paul Ryan, who's expressed reservations about backing the presumptive presidential nominee. Trump held back-to-back meetings on Thursday at party headquarters on Capitol Hill. First, Trump met with Ryan and the party chairman, Reince Priebus (ryns PREE'-bus). Then he sat down with other members of the House Republican leadership, including Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Whip Steve Scalise (skuh-LEES'). Trump plans a separate meeting with Senate GOP leaders later Thursday. ___ 10:20 a.m. The head of the Republican Party says the meeting with Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan was \"a very positive step toward party unity.\" Reince Priebus (ryns PREE'-bus) tweeted that comment after their meeting Thursday morning at GOP headquarters on Capitol Hill. Priebus tweeted: \"The meeting was great. It was a very positive step toward party unity.\" Ryan said last week that he wasn't ready to endorse Trump, the presumptive presidential nominee. ___ 10:05 a.m. The longest serving Republican in the Senate says he'll now support Donald Trump. But Utah's Orrin Hatch says the presumptive GOP presidential nominee needs to tone it down. Hatch is among the Senate GOP leaders set to meet with Trump later Thursday. Hatch says Trump needs to soften his rhetoric and \"always act in a manner worthy\" of a nominee. The senator isn't getting into details, but Trump has made critical comments about women, Hispanics and others. Hatch says many of his constituents \"have serious reservations\" about Trump. In March, Utah voters went big for Trump's chief rival at the time, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, in the state's caucuses. Hatch says Trump could unite Republicans and broaden his appeal by reconsidering his views on trade and overhauling benefit programs. Hatch initially backed Jeb Bush in the race, and then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Hatch says he'll \"do what I can\" to help Trump run a successful campaign. ___ 9:40 a.m. It's a \"circus out here.\" That's what a Democratic congressman says as he walked by the Capitol Hill building where Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are meeting \u2014 and where boisterous protesters have gathered in the street. Texas lawmaker Joaquin Castro says Trump \u2014 the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 \"has been extremely divisive for the country\" and is \"tearing people apart. You can see the circus out here.\" ___ 9:15 a.m. Donald Trump has taken strong stands on immigration \u2014 and drawn equally strong reactions during his presidential campaign. And it was no different when the Republican candidate arrived at a Capitol Hill building for his meeting Thursday morning with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Protesters tried to deliver a cardboard coffin to the Republican National Committee that they said represented the suffering of immigrants under GOP policies \u2014 and the death of the party under Trump. The protesters weren't allowed inside, but they did continue chanting and waving signs. 9:05 a.m. A smattering of protesters are outside the Republican National Committee offices on Capitol Hill where Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are meeting. The presidential candidate entered the building through a side door for his first-ever get-together with the Wisconsin lawmaker \u2014 who hasn't yet backed the presumptive nominee. Outside, fewer than a dozen people are demonstrating \u2014 but they're outnumbered by a sizable pack of reporters. Some demonstrators are carrying signs that say \"R.I.P. GOP\" and using a megaphone to express their views that Trump's rise means the fall of the Republican Party. One chant is: \"Down with deportation, up with liberation\"",

            "article_content": "John Roberts reports from New York As the results of the 2016 election came in on Tuesday night I kept saying to myself, \u201cwow, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u00a0And then a second later: \u201cNo it\u2019s not -- I\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d On the June 23 of this year, to be precise. That was the night the British people voted to leave the EU, in what has now become well known here in America as \u201cBrexit.\u201d That evening started, too, with the pundits and the pollsters and all the establishment figures in politics, the media and business predicting a solid victory for the status quo. But pretty soon, smug establishment complacency turned to shock and then pure bewilderment as the truth sank in: the people had risen up, rejected the ruling class, and voted for radical change. Donald Trump\u2019s victory \u00a0is a much bigger deal, and a much more remarkable political achievement than Brexit. But there are two big similarities (as well as one big difference), and it\u2019s worth noting them as we try to make sense of the extraordinary conclusion to the 2016 presidential race. The first similarity is in the underlying economic and social realities that explain the vote for Brexit and the vote for Trump. As I\u2019ve argued previously, a shockingly high number of Americans are really struggling financially, and have been for years, even decades. Their incomes are down, they see jobs disappearing, and opportunities for their kids vanishing. Worse, they have seen this happen, unabated, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans have been in power. No wonder they\u2019re angry and want change. No wonder they responded to a political outsider who wasn\u2019t tainted with the failures of the last twenty years. And no wonder that they were even prepared to overlook Donald Trump\u2019s personal flaws and checkered history in order to give a massive middle finger to the political, media and business establishment that made itself richer while they, working Americans, got poorer. To dismiss all that as racism, sexism and all the other -isms that the politically correct establishment threw at Trump and his supporters (just as the establishment hurled similar insults at Brexit supporters here) is just a cynical attempt to evade responsibility for the failure of the ruling elite\u2019s policies. For many years, we\u2019ve been living in a world run by bankers, bureaucrats and accountants who have pushed a technocratic agenda of globalization, centralization and unlimited immigration that has improved life for poor countries, and for rich people in rich countries, but which has undermined the economic security and social stability of working people in the west. The effect has probably been starker in America than anywhere else. But it was almost totally missed by the establishment. They failed to see that policies which they viewed as being \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019 were actually causing real hardship in parts of the country they rarely, if ever, visited. Instead of understanding, empathizing and trying to do something about it, politicians and, vitally, most of the American media simply dismissed any opposition as prejudice. That\u2019s why so many Trump supporters ended up quietly resolving to vote for the insurgent candidate they saw as their champion, but refusing to tell friends, colleagues -- or pollsters! -- that they were in his camp. Who needs the abuse? And that\u2019s the second similarity with Brexit, right there. In the UK in June, there was a hidden Brexit vote comprised of people who had gone underground, politically speaking, as a result of the moral shaming handed out by contemptuous elites. Ditto for Trump. The biggest difference with Brexit is the biggest opportunity for America. Unlike Brexit, the election this week was a contest of different political philosophies and, vitally, competing agendas. There was a clear winner -- not just for the presidency but in Congress, too. That means that we now have the possibility of united government ready to implement a clear reform plan. Since Brexit was not decided in a conventional election with alternative plans on offer, there was no clarity about the specific details of what leaving the EU should actually look like. By contrast, a new and dynamic conservative agenda seems to be taking shape right before our eyes, with Donald Trump and Paul Ryan already setting out their intention to work together to deliver a pro-growth economic reform plan, surely the most urgent priority today. So while we can certainly identify the ways in which Trump\u2019s victory reminds us of Brexit, it\u2019s the difference that should give Americans the greatest grounds for optimism today.",

            "article_content": "GOP candidate weighs in on president's press conference, Trump's refugee remarks, rise of ISIS President Barack Obama said Sunday the U.S.-led coalition \u201cwill not relent\u201d in the fight against the Islamic State and was confident the terror group would be defeated, insisting the world would not accept the extremists\u2019 attacks on civilians in Paris and elsewhere as the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Speaking at the end of the ASEAN summit in Malaysia, Obama also pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin to align himself with the U.S.-led coalition, noting that the Islamic State has been accused of bringing down a Russian airliner last month, killing 224 people. \"He needs to go after the people who killed Russia's citizens,\" Obama said of Putin The president was wrapping up a nine-day trip to Turkey and Asia, where he met with Putin on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. Despite Russia ramping up its air campaign in Syria against ISIS, Obama said Moscow has focused its attention on the rebel forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad, a Russian ally. He called on Russia to make a \u201cstrategic adjustment\u201d and drop its support for Assad. Obama said violence in Syria will not be stopped as long as Assad is in office. \"It will not work to keep him in power,\" Obama said. \"We can't stop the fighting.\" Nearly five years of fighting between the Assad government and rebels has created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State to thrive in both Syria and Iraq. The militant group is now setting its sights on targets outside its stronghold, including the attacks in Paris that killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more. French President Francois Hollande is scheduled to meet with Obama at the White House Tuesday to discuss ways to bolster the international fight against ISIS. Hollande will then meet with Putin in Moscow. The discussions about a military coalition to defeat the Islamic State come amid parallel talks about a diplomatic solution to end Syria\u2019s civil war. The violence has killed more than 250,000 people and displaced millions, sparking a refugee crisis in Europe. Foreign ministers from about 20 nations agreed last week to an ambitious yet incomplete plan that sets a Jan. 1 deadline for the start of negotiations between Assad's government and opposition groups. Within six months, the negotiations are to establish a \"credible, inclusive and non-sectarian\" transitional government that would set a schedule for drafting a new constitution and holding a free and fair U.N.-supervised election within 18 months. The Paris attacks have heightened fears of terrorism in the West and also sparked a debate in the U.S. about accepting refugees from Syria. It's unclear whether any of the terrorists in the Paris attacks exploited the refugee system to enter Europe, though Obama has insisted that's not a legitimate security threat in the United States. \"Refugees who end up in the United States are the most vetted, scrutinized, thoroughly investigated individuals that ever arrive on American shores,\" Obama said. Still, the House passed legislation last week that would block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the U.S. Democrats in large numbers abandoned the president, with 47 voting for the legislation. Having secured a veto-proof majority in the House, supporters are now hoping for a repeat in the Senate, while Obama works to shift the conversation to milder visa waiver changes that wouldn't affect Syrian refugees. Obama has focused his ire on Republicans throughout the trip, harshly criticizing GOP lawmakers and presidential candidates for acting contrary to American values. He took a softer tone Sunday, saying he understands Americans' concerns but urging them not to give into fear. He said the Islamic State \"can't beat us on the battlefield so they try to terrorize us into being afraid.\" Speaking dismissively of the Islamic State's global prowess, Obama said, \"They're a bunch of killers with good social media.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

It\u2019s what Marc Ambinder calls \u201cthe last, best hope for Democrats\u201d to save the Senate. The plan calls for broad executive action by President Obama to legalize illegal immigrants to goad Republicans into a similar fight as last year\u2019s failed effort to strip funding from ObamaCare. The next shutdown deadline comes on Sept. 30 and if the president drops his executive action on immigration on schedule (\u201cend of the summer\u201d) it would be just in time to chum the water ahead of votes on a short-term budget measure. Ambinder writes: \u201cGo big on immigration. Wait for the GOP counter-reaction. Quietly pray for the government to get shut down. Use it like a cattle prod to wake voters up just before the midterms.\u201d [Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who says he\u2019s been \u201clistening very carefully\u201d in meetings at the White House hinted to Sean Hannity that he believes \u201cover six million undocumented workers\u201d will be granted amnesty by the president.]Hitting the sweet spot - The president would need to find a sweet spot in which his allies in big business and his liberal base both like the action, but it doesn\u2019t create further uproar among Democratic Senate candidates who are taking increasingly harsh lines against Obama\u2019s vaunted \u201cpen power.\u201d Georgia Senate nominee Michelle Nunn, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu have all raised warnings about executive overreach. It\u2019s not surprising. If Obama goes too far, the voter backlash could be intense. Fashioning the kind of action that can please business, activists and red state Democrats is no easy task, especially since Obama will need some legal defense in order to not have a court toss it out before the plan can even get started. [Daily Caller: \u201cClose to 80 organizations, including the National Council of La Raza and the AFL-CIO, are asking the administration to allow illegal immigrants who are granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status to seek health coverage on Obamacare exchanges.\u201d]Fantasyland - Obama could hit a hole-in-one in \u2013 please his business-activist coalition but still manage to enrage conservatives enough to demand a shutdown to block the president. That\u2019s the scenario that is providing some comfort to Democrats these days, but as we see on other issues Democratic unity is no sure bet these days. The most likely scenario seems to be that Obama comes up with something unsatisfying to most involved and that Speaker John Boehner can convince his members to deny Democrats a shutdown just ahead of the election, but stranger things have happened. Not many, though.ENDANGERED DEMS NAME AND SHAME OBAMA ON GLOBAL WARMING EXECUTIVE ACTIONWashington Examiner: \u201cSen. Mary Landrieu [D-La.], chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is warning the president against agreeing to any climate pact that would \u2018negotiate away\u2019 the nation\u2019s growing energy sector. And Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., pledged to work with Congress \u2018to do everything we can\u2019 to stop executive branch moves that hurt the coal industry\u2026 \u2018It is important that all nations do what they can to reduce carbon in the atmosphere,\u2019 Landrieu said in a statement. \u2018But the president should not take any action that undermines the American Energy Revolution currently underway that is creating thousands of high-paying jobs for middle-class families in Louisiana and across the country.\u2019Bad timing - Politico today rhapsodizes about how Rep. Gary Peters, who is struggling to hold a Senate seat for Democrats in Michigan, is an outlier in his party on the issue of global warming. Peters is under fire for investments that don\u2019t match his environmental rhetoric and for doing the bidding of political patrons. [A new ad launched by the National Republican Senatorial Committee seeks to paint Peters as out of touch for supporting the Wall Street bailout that benefitted his old company. Democrats, meanwhile, are returning to abortion attacks on Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land.]DEMANDS GROW FOR SYRIA AUTHORIZATIONWhile Democrats are pinning their hopes to save the Senate on a government shutdown, they may not have noticed the growing fight over whether the president needs congressional authority to expand his air war against Islamist militants across the Iraq border to Syria. AP reports that one way around congressional authorization for the escalation would be to obtain \u201cback-channel consent to American attacks\u201d from the genocidal dictator Bashar al Assad. If the administration\u2019s claims are as reedy as that count on serious bipartisan blowback .Rand smacks Hillary on Syria stance - In a WSJ OpEd, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., argues that interventionist like 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton have aided the rise of the terror group ISIS: \u201cTo interventionists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, we would caution that arming the Islamic rebels in Syria created a haven for the Islamic State. We are lucky Mrs. Clinton didn't get her way and the Obama administration did not bring about regime change in Syria. That new regime might well be ISIS.\u201d [The Hill: \u201cHillary Clinton and President Obama plan to both address a women's forum hosted by the Democratic National Committee next month in Washington\u2026 Both Clinton and Obama are scheduled to speak on Sept. 19\u2026]WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Judah Bellin at City Journal looks at some solutions springing from states to tame the runaway cost of college education. Oregon, Washington, Tennessee and Texas are trying radically different ideas, including the Oregon plan to set student loan repayment as a percent of future income not a dollar amount and Tennessee\u2019s plan to offer free two-year tuition at community and technical colleges. But Texas\u2019 effort may be the most revolutionary. The Lone Star State is \u00a0challenging schools to develop low-cost degree programs for students for who the idea of a four-year, full-time undergraduate degree program is unrealistic: \u201cPerhaps the program\u2019s biggest innovation is that it awards credits for mastery of material, not time spent in the classroom. The \u2018school year\u2019 is divided into six seven-week terms, and students pay a flat fee of $750 for each term that they\u2019re enrolled. Students are free to finish as many credits as they can within each term. \u2026They can proceed at their own pace, giving them significant control over the cost of their degree\u2014a novel notion for American higher education.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Likewise, Begich said several times he needed to educate Sullivan on issues he did not understand, like how the Senate works\u2026 The candidates also clashed on healthcare reform. When it was Sullivan\u2019s turn to ask Begich a question, he asked if the senator could go back and cast the deciding vote on the president\u2019s health-care law again, would he do it again?... \u2018The issue of health-care is a tough call.

Trende\u2019s point is that it\u2019s too soon to say and that defining a \u201cwave\u201d is subjective, anyway. A gain of five seats for the GOP, the low-end expectation for Republicans, would be huge by historical standards, but if the media metric sets the bar at eight seats this cycle, then the wave is called a ripple: \u201cSo to a certain degree, I think the question of why we don\u2019t see a wave today involves a false premise: We see evidence of one right now.

Recent polls show a tightening Presidential race.\u00a0 Trump has brought millions of new people into the Republican Party and connected with \u201cforgotten Americans\u201d who believe their government has failed them.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what Trump must do to further solidify his bond with the \u201csilent majority,\u201d convince Republicans and conservatives who didn\u2019t support him to join him now to prevent an Obama 3rd term, expand the Electoral College map and continue to dominate media coverage. ? Go to the San Diego-Tijuana border and highlight the one part of our border where our government built a secure double-fence as mandated by the Secure Fence Act.\u00a0 Illegal crossings, drugs, murders and other crimes have been drastically reduced.\u00a0 He should be joined by U.S. Representative Peter King and former House Armed Services Chairman Duncan Hunter, co-sponsors of the 2006 Secure Fence Act and announce that his wall will be patterned after this legislation that the last two administrations failed to enforce and fund. ? Give a major address on China.\u00a0 Focus on our massive trade deficit with China, as well as China\u2019s \u201ccyber war\u201d against our national security and economic interests. ? Have a robust \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d (GOTV) and data analytics technology platform.\u00a0 Over 90 million eligible voters did not vote in 2012 and this year roughly 40% of Republicans and Democrats say they may look to another candidate or stay home.\u00a0 Independents will be more important than ever.\u00a0 The votes are there for Trump to win, but he must have the best technology platform a GOP nominee has ever had to identify his supporters and get them to vote. ? Choreograph the Republican National Convention so that each night highlights a specific issue that connects with voters Trump must turn out.\u00a0 Have one night focused on the military and veterans.\u00a0 Another could be focused on securing our borders (highlight how terrorists have used our open border policy, etc.).\u00a0 Faith and family night could highlight the need to end common core\u2014something Trump connected with evangelicals on early in the campaign.\u00a0 Jobs and economy night could be on the last night with him accepting the nomination.\u00a0 An underlying theme could also show a side of Trump that most haven\u2019t seen.\u00a0 There are stories of his generosity helping people in need.\u00a0 While it\u2019s not in his character to talk about such things\u2014the American people need to see this side of him. ? Picking the right vice presidential running mate will be crucial.\u00a0 New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Ohio Governor John Kasich would be solid choices and help the ticket big time.\u00a0 Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich would be the most effective at getting Trump\u2019s agenda enacted and his intellect and vision are sorely needed in a dysfunctional government. ? Identify key presidential appointments, including cabinet positions and a pool of qualified jurists he would pick from for the Supreme Court.\u00a0 President Reagan said that \u201cPersonnel is policy.\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately, no President for the last 25 years has been ready with his key appointments when he took office and it routinely takes over 6 months after the Inaugural to get key personnel in place.\u00a0 By doing this, Trump can say the country is a mess and we need a President who is ready to hit the ground running on Day 1.\u00a0 His announcement of Governor Chris Christie to head his \u201ctransition team\u201d is a good step. ? Enter into a \u201cContract with America\u201d patterned after what House Republicans did in 1994.\u00a0 Focus on securing the border, scrapping the Iran deal, protecting the 2nd Amendment, ending common core, rebuilding America\u2019s military and bringing jobs back home. ? Give an address on how he would work with our allies in the Muslim world to defeat radical Islam.\u00a0 His recent foreign policy speech mentioned this, but you didn\u2019t hear much about it on the evening news.\u00a0 Make King Abdullah, of Jordan, a central part of his strategy.\u00a0 Abdullah, a descendant of Mohammad, is pro-West and complained to our Congress last year about our government\u2019s bureaucracy not giving him all he needs to fight radical Islam. ? Focus on the Rust Belt states.\u00a0 Remind voters this used to be the industrial heartland of America.\u00a0 Families here, who traditionally vote Democrat, have suffered real economic hardship thanks to NAFTA and outsourcing of American jobs.\u00a0 The blue-collar billionaire\u2019s message resonates with them.\u00a0 The Teamsters Union, which backed Ronald Reagan in 1980, is taking a hard look at Trump and many members are already on board.\u00a0 The 1.3 million Teamsters and their families could play a big role in Trump expanding the GOP Electoral College map. ?\u00a0 Remind those Republicans who opposed him for the nomination that President Reagan was right when he said, \u201cMy eighty-percent friend is not my twenty-percent enemy,\u201d and that the traditional GOP based coupled with the millions of new voters he\u2019s brought into the Republican Party is a winning combination. Donald Trump has a real chance to win the presidency.\u00a0 He has connected with working class Americans unlike any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s entering the championship rounds now, though, and the establishment and elites will come at him with everything they\u2019ve got.\u00a0 He must convince the electorate that this is the most important election of our lifetime and the last real chance to keep the America our founding fathers envisioned.",

            "article_content": "Former House speaker urges the Republican nominee to focus on the issues amid new allegations against him We finally know why Hillary Clinton refused to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to bankers and special interests: When her staff assembled a list of the most damaging comments in those transcripts, they must have seen immediately that they could not afford for the material ever to be made public. In one speech, Hillary described how politicians often \u201cneed both a public and a private position.\u201d She elaborated that at times, Abraham Lincoln had a public position that was different from the private, secret goal he was actually pursuing. The list of speech excerpts, in emails made public this month by WikiLeaks, didn\u2019t require us to look far to discover Hillary Clinton\u2019s own secret goal. In a secret, $225,000 speech to Brazilian bankers in 2013, she let her mask down revealed the goal she truly wants to pursue. Hillary\u2019s dream of open borders would send the wages and incomes of millions of Americans into a free fall. \u201cMy dream,\u201d she said, \u201cis a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.\u201d In other words, open borders and open trade for the entire hemisphere\u2014all of the countries in North and South America. Not just her hope. Not just her wish. Her dream. Let\u2019s consider the implications of Hillary\u2019s dream. Hillary wants an open border with Canada and an open border with Mexico, our two closest neighbors. She also wants open borders with and among all of the countries in Central America and South America. In addition to open borders with all of those countries, she us to have open trade with them, so that all of their people can choose to live and work in the United States if they please. There are about 210 million people in North America outside the United States, including the entire populations of Mexico and Canada. There are 42 million people in Central America\u2014the seven countries from Guatemala to Panama, some of which are among the most violent places on Earth. There are 422 million people in South America\u2014more than the entire population of the United States. How many of those roughly 675 million people do you think would like to come and work in the U.S.? Hillary\u2019s dream of open borders would send the wages and incomes of millions of Americans into a free fall. At the same time, it would mean an explosion of welfare costs for the states and federal government. Hillary\u2019s dream would literally drive Americans, and America, bankrupt. But it\u2019s not just our jobs and our economy that Hillary\u2019s dream would destroy. Consider what else this radical vision of open borders would mean. It would mean we\u2019d have no capacity to stop terrorists from entering the United States. ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other terrorists could come in through any one of more than two dozen countries, and make their way freely to the U.S. We\u2019d have no capacity to stop Mexican heroin and Columbian cocaine, or gangs, like the violent and vicious MS-13 from El Salvador. And it would mean no capacity to stop the spread of diseases from around the world into the United States. For most Americans, this isn\u2019t a dream. It\u2019s a warning of a future that could be all too real. Because if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, she\u2019d have the power to make these ambitions a reality. She would only have to continue and expand President Obama\u2019s policies of deliberate non-enforcement of our immigration laws. There would be no check on Hillary\u2019s power to realize her dream of open borders\u2014and for millions of families, that would mean the destruction of the American dream.",

            "article_content": "The number of families and unaccompanied children apprehended on southern border has skyrocketed, according to new Obama administration stats. David V. Aguilar, the former Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, goes 'On the Record' The Obama administration has spent at least $18.5 million to fly \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d caught crossing into the country illegally to locations inside the United States, according to newly obtained figures. The numbers, shared with FoxNews.com by the Senate subcommittee on immigration, were provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in response to questions from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The numbers shed light on the extent of a program that has drawn scrutiny not just from lawmakers but the federal courts, amid concerns the U.S. government is effectively aiding smugglers. \u201cThis shows how fundamentally flawed our approach to immigration enforcement has been in the Obama administration,\u201d a Senate aide who has seen the questions to and answers from ICE Director Sarah Saldana told FoxNews.com. The administration, which continues to grapple with waves of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and has gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of minors, has defended the practice as appropriate. But it comes with a cost. The ICE figures show that from June 8, 2014 to Sept. 30, 2015, ICE spent $4.8 million on charter flights for the children (ICE could not provide figures before that period). From March 2009 to Sept. 30, 2015, ICE spent $13.7 million on commercial flights for unaccompanied minors utilizing funds appropriated to ICE. In total, the cost reaches at least $18.5 million. \u201cThis admission by ICE demonstrates that the United States is a party to countless conspiracies by illegal aliens to violate our immigration laws, by facilitating their illegal journey into the United States,\u201d the Senate aide said. Past accounts have said children have been flown from the U.S.-Mexico border to live with relatives, many of whom also are in the U.S. illegally. But an ICE official told FoxNews.com on Friday they\u2019re only transporting minors to facilities run by Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement, \u201cas dictated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA).\u201d The official added: \u201cICE does not transport children directly to parents or final destinations. We should also be clear that Congress has appropriated funds for the sole purpose of transporting these unaccompanied minors\u2014that funding is separate from ICE\u2019s enforcement and other funding. ICE is directed in this process by laws that Congress enacts and with funds they appropriate for that specific purpose.\u201d Separate questions to ICE posed by Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 office have yet to be answered. In its written response to Cruz, ICE said it was unable to provide specific data regarding the number of unaccompanied children transported via commercial flight but that it is \u201cin the process\u201d of expanding its use of \u201ccontractor-conducted escorts in FY 2016 and will be able to provide more reliable data going forward.\u201d ICE reported that between June 2014 and September 2015, about 10,000 children were transported by charter flights. ICE has defended its role in transporting illegal immigrant children before -- namely, after U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen complained in a Dec. 13, 2013 order that federal agents were intercepting human smugglers transporting children at the U.S.-Mexico border and then delivering those same children to their parents. He called the practice \"dangerous.\" The comment prompted John Sandweg, ICE\u2019s acting director at the time, to send an email to ICE employees defending the program and saying that the transportation of unaccompanied children by ICE personnel \u201cis appropriate and legal.\u201d Despite its legality, the practice still isn\u2019t sitting well with some. \u201cWhile ICE has spent millions of taxpayer dollars flying these young migrants to ... their chosen destination, it has not taken any action against their illegal alien family members who paid to have them smuggled to the United States,\u201d the Senate source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.",

            "article_content": "Jan. 7, 2015: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) HERSHEY, Pa. \u2013 Republican leaders have yet to spell out their strategy for tackling ObamaCare now that they control Congress, and so far have pursued a piecemeal approach -- but are crossing their fingers that a looming Supreme Court case will give them an opening to unravel the law. GOP leaders huddled this week at a retreat in Hershey, Pa., where the Affordable Care Act was a chief topic. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, on Thursday called ObamaCare a \"terrible law\" that needs to be replaced because it's \"beyond repair.\" But Ryan also said he did not have a \"timeline\" for doing so. Leaders still say they want to repeal the law. But while the 114th Congress kicked off with major statements on energy and immigration -- the House voted recently to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and reverse President Obama's immigration actions -- proposals pertaining to ObamaCare have been far more modest. Last week, the House passed a bill that would define a full-time worker under the health law as working 40 hours per week. The law currently uses a lower threshold -- part of a formula that determines which businesses have to provide health insurance to workers. Lawmakers are concerned the provision is leading businesses to cut back hours to skirt the mandate. And legislation has been proposed in both chambers to repeal the law's 2.3 percent tax on medical devices such as X-ray equipment and artificial joints. The Senate version has bipartisan support and could get a vote in the coming weeks. Critics of the law say the two provisions hurt the economy and job growth, though President Obama would likely veto both. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is also trying again to pass a bill that would allow Americans to opt out of the law's individual requirement to buy insurance -- a more sweeping measure. Republicans still want to do more. Ryan said Thursday that ObamaCare would be replaced with something that gives Americans more choices and lowers costs, improves their access to care and is \"truly patient centered\" -- an apparent reference to GOP planning for the wild card in all this, the Supreme Court case. The case, called King v. Burwell, could impact the legality of billions of dollars' worth of subsidies through the law. And Republicans want to be ready with a plan if the ruling goes against the administration. Plaintiffs argue the law doesn't allow the federal government to offer subsidies to customers in states that don't operate their own insurance exchanges. The White House has downplayed the case, saying such lawsuits \"won't stand in the way of the Affordable Care Act and the millions of Americans who can now afford health insurance because of it.\" The White House argues the subsidies are being directed in accordance with the \"intent of the law.\" Earlier Thursday, a Republican aide who attended a session on ObamaCare said the discussions centered on the best strategy in the context of that high court case. The aide said Ryan told fellow lawmakers they must move quickly to show the country that Republicans have a patient-focused response to the case. Opening arguments are scheduled to start in March with a decision expected in June. A victory for the plaintiffs could have a huge impact on the law, sending enrollment plummeting. Ryan also updated fellow lawmakers about upcoming ObamaCare deadlines and gave them an overview of the law since it took effect in January 2014 -- including updates on subsidies, exchange programs and cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Later Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner emerged from the close-door meetings at the retreat to echo Ryan's remarks. \"Our challenge, our opportunity is to pass common-sense solutions ... that repeal ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered reforms that will help our constituents have better access to high-quality health care in America,\" he said at a joint press conference with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Earlier this year, McConnell made clear that Congress will vote on either repealing or \"taking out pieces\" of ObamaCare, but he and fellow senators had little to say at the retreat about a unified strategy. To be sure, the GOP Senate caucus' most conservative members will be pushing for full repeal. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a potential White House candidate, said on Monday that Republicans will get \"walloped\" in the 2016 elections if they ignore voter mandates after midterms that gave them Senate control, which includes the push to repeal ObamaCare. At least one Republican senator, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, has proposed legislation to repeal the law. And this week, the influential conservative group Club for Growth sent a letter to McConnell and Boehner urging them to \"continue to be diligent\" in their repeal efforts.",

            "article_content": "Federal hearing taking place after immigrants who should have been deported were granted citizenship An internal Obama administration email shows immigration officials may be literally working overtime to swear in as many new \u201ccitizen voters\u201d as possible before the Nov. 8 presidential election, a powerful lawmaker charged Thursday. The email, from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office chief and part of a chain of correspondence within the agency, urges the unnamed recipient to swear in as many citizens as possible \u201cdue to the election year.\u201d \u201cThe Field Office due to the election year needs to process as many of their N-400 cases as possible between now and FY 2016,\u201d reads the email, which was disclosed to FoxNews.com by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \u201cIf you have cases in this category or other pending, you are encouraged to take advantage of the OT if you can,\u201d the email continues. \u201cThis will be an opportunity to move your pending naturalization cases. If you have not volunteered for OT, please consider and let me know if you are interested.\u201d Parts of the email were redacted before it was disclosed to FoxNews.com, but it was sent by the branch chief of the Houston Field Office District 17. It was not clear to whom it was addressed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better!\u201d reads the July 21 note introducing the forwarded missive. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the year crunch time, so let\u2019s get crunchy! Go Team Houston! Thanks for all your hard work!\u201d Johnson and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, in a Wednesday letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, said it appears the agency is trying to swear in new citizens as the election between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and GOP choice Donald Trump approaches. \u201cYour department seems intent on approving as many naturalization cases as quickly as possible at a time when it should instead be putting on the brakes and reviewing past adjudications,\u201d the senator\u2019s letter read. Johnson referred to a report this week from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General that found at least 858 people from terror hotspots and other countries of concern had been mistakenly granted citizenship despite facing orders of deportation under other identities. \"Considering that USCIS already has a troubling record of inadequate review of naturalization applications, and mistakenly giving away citizenship to terrorists, criminals and other fraudsters, it is disturbing that they are now in full and blind rubber stamp mode to crank out new citizens,\" said\u00a0Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. In a USCIS planning document submitted to Congress earlier this year, USCIS reported it expected to receive 828,000 total applications this year, up from a planned 815,000 last year, an increase of 13,000, Vaughan said. A USCIS official, though, said the processing push has to do with managing applications in a timely manner -- and officials are merely trying to deal with the surge in applications typical in election years. \"USCIS\u2019s goal is to process applications for naturalization within five to seven months, regardless of external events such as elections,\" the official said. \"USCIS anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, as we usually see in an election year, but the increase in N-400 applications has exceeded expectations. USCIS has detailed staff to offices experiencing increased workloads and has authorized overtime for many offices.\" The official added: \"USCIS certainly encourages our naturalized citizens to be active participants in our democracy. However, like other citizens, no new U.S. citizen is required to register to vote, or participate in any election. The issue at hand is our desire to ensure naturalization applications are processed within our normal times.\" The effort is reminiscent of a similar bid to bring in new voters when Bill Clinton ran for re-election in 1996, said Claude\u00a0Arnold, a retired U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations. \"I am not at all surprised by this revelation,\" Arnold said. \"This is a repeat of the Clinton election playbook. Then it was to help re-elect Bill Clinton, this time it is to help elect Hillary Clinton.\" The all-out push shows the Obama administration is using levers to help Clinton win, said Dan Stein, president of Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"In the pursuit of a partisan advantage, one party has decided integrity in the system is irrelevant,\" Stein said. \"They don\u2019t really care about checking backgrounds or verifying status and eligibility \u2013 it is more about increasing the number of eligible voters in the upcoming election.\"",

It\u2019s hard to believe it happened on the same day\u2014and is quite revealing of how the media world is handling the volatile issue of illegal immigration (as well as how polarized they are over Trump).

Politico, in a news story, said Trump had been \u201cplaying at diplomacy in Mexico,\u201d that his speech made clear that what happened there, \u201cmuch like his campaign's two-weeks of gentle walkbacks, was a ruse.\u201d And, for good measure, called the entire episode a \u201cfarce.\u201d But let\u2019s take a step back.

He appeared on the world stage with Enrique Pena Nieto, handled himself well, and both men spoke of having an open and constructive conversation. Sure, Trump had claimed that making Mexico pay for a border wall hadn\u2019t come up, while Pena Nieto later said he made clear his country would do no such thing. But diplomacy doesn\u2019t mean hammering away on the most divisive issue the first time you meet a foreign leader, especially if you\u2019re, well, not yet president. Every challenger, and especially one who\u2019s never held elective office, has to pass a commander-in-chief test. So those images were especially valuable for the billionaire outsider. And had he simply returned to Trump Tower, he would have basked in 48 hours of positive coverage. But instead he gave the loud and fiery address in Phoenix, and the New York Times couldn\u2019t hide its disdain: \u201cYet the juxtaposition of Mr. Trump\u2019s dual performances was so jarring that his true vision and intentions on immigration were hard to discern. He displayed an almost unrecognizable demeanor during his afternoon in Mexico, appearing measured and diplomatic, while hours later he took the stage at his campaign rally and denounced illegal immigrants on the whole as a criminally minded and dangerous group that sows terror in communities and commits murders, rapes and other heinous violence.\u201d For the record, I don\u2019t believe he denounced illegal immigrants \u201con the whole\u201d as criminals, though he certainly played up the dangers of allowing them to stay here without being vetted and emphasized that those with criminal records would be booted out. (The Times piece also went through a significant rewrite after the first edition, as you can see here.) Much of the press didn\u2019t really credit Trump for dropping his mass deportation plan in favor of dealing with the non-criminals of the 11 million illegal immigrants in several years, after the rest of his plan is in place. Instead, there were observations that his base might not like the change. And while the left trashed the speech as \u201cunhinged and demagogic,\u201d as Salon put it, the underlying tone elsewhere was that Trump was consumed with throwing red meat to the anti-immigrant crowd, and parading relatives of those killed by illegal immigrants. By yesterday, Trump was back to telling supporter Laura Ingraham on her radio show that \u201cthere\u2019s quite a bit of softening\u201d in his plan. Now there\u2019s legitimate media criticism to be made of whether Trump was sending mixed messages at Wednesday\u2019s twin events, and whether the speech did nothing to draw moderate voters to his cause. But for a decade now, the mainstream media mindset has been in favor of modest immigration reform. That was true when George W. Bush was pushing it. It was true with the Republican \u201cautopsy\u201d after 2012. It was true when Marco Rubio and the Gang of 8 were trying to push a compromise measure through Congress. That\u2019s why the pundits were so surprised when Trump won the nomination after embracing such ideas as a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. He\u2019s playing on a bigger field now, of course, but on this issue, at least, much of the media still find his message distasteful.",

            "article_content": "Mohammad Gulab, shown at left Skyping with immigration attorney Michael Wildes, is living in an undisclosed location. He's received death threats since the case of him saving former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, (r.), was portrayed in a film. (Michael Wildes, Reuters) An Afghan villager who saved a Navy SEAL and was portrayed in a Hollywood film faces death threats from the Taliban and is having a tough time getting permission to come to the U.S., according to his lawyer. Mohammad Gulab's ordeal began in 2005, when Marcus Luttrell and three fellow Navy SEALs were ambushed by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. A fierce fight left three dead and Luttrell, the only American survivor, with a broken back and several shrapnel wounds. Luttrell credits Gulab with saving his life, as the Afghan brought the wounded soldier into his home and protected him from the Taliban until U.S. reinforcements arrived. \u201cHe is not safe until he\u2019s on U.S. soil.\" The scene was depicted in the 2013 movie \u201cLone Survivor.\u201d Luttrell was also a friend of Chris Kyle, the subject of the new record-smashing\u00a0movie\u00a0American Sniper, and went through sniper training with him. Yet although Gulab\u2019s heroism has been depicted on the big screen, life has reportedly been hard for him since saving Luttrell. He has had to leave his hometown and hide from the Taliban and at one point, he was reportedly attacked and shot in the leg. Now he wants to come to America, where he believes he will be safer, but his lawyer tells FoxNews.com that bureaucracy is making the process difficult and slow. Gulab has said Luttrell offered to help him obtain a green card, but the relationship between the two men appears to have become strained while Gulab was visiting the U.S. last year \u00a0for the premiere of \"Lone Survivor.\" When contacted by FoxNews.com, Lutrell declined to comment on Gulab or his bid for asylum. For now, Gulab's hopes rest with Michael Wildes, a New York-based immigration attorney who has taken the case for free. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is currently reviewing his file to determine whether or not they would put in a request with the United Nations to have him relocated to U.S. based on what he did,\u201d Wildes told FoxNews.com. (Left To Right) Gunner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mate Second Class Danny P. Dietz, 25, from Aurora, Colo, Lt. Michael P. Murphy, from Patchogue, N.Y. and Sonar Technician Second Class Matthew G. Axelson, 29, from Cupertino, Calif., killed by enemy forces during a reconnaissance mission June 28, 2005. DHS officials did not return calls seeking comment. Wildes added that, although he has managed to get Gulab out of Afghanistan and into an undisclosed third country, it is still urgent that Gulab be given asylum in the U.S. \u201cHe is not safe until he\u2019s on U.S. soil,\" Wildes said. \"I am prayerful this will happen soon.\u201d If Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson finds Gulab's bid for asylum worthy, the department would submit the request to the UN. If approved by the world body, Gulab will be allowed to come to the U.S. and seek asylum, said Wildes. \u201cThat\u2019s as simple as it takes\u2026 I wish it would happen as instinctively as Mohammed Gulab gave Marcus Luttrell safety. We should be returning that same sentiment,\u201d he said. Since the story was first reported by CBS News, some have noted that Gulab visited America before, and have questioned why he did not apply for asylum then if his life is in such risk. Gulab visted once in 2010 when Luttrell paid for a round-trip ticket so that he could come visit, and again in 2013 when Universal Studios paid for him to come to the premiere of \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d which features him saving Luttrell. Wildes said that circumstances have gotten much more dangerous for Gulab with the release of the movie. \u201c[The problem] became more acute over time,\u201d Wildes said.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump renewed warnings about Middle Eastern refugees and other immigrants coming to America on the heels of Sunday\u2019s terror massacre in Orlando, while claiming thousands already are in the country who \u2013 like the shooter \u2013 are \u201csick with hate.\u201d Though the gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen, Trump told Fox News on Monday that the U.S. is allowing others into the country who are \u201cno different than this maniac.\u201d \u201cThis could be the all-time great Trojan horse,\u201d Trump said, of those being admitted from Syria and other nations. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has only amplified his warnings about immigration and the terror threat since Sunday\u2019s massacre left 49 dead and even more wounded. At the same time, he\u2019s aggressively criticized both President Obama and likely general election rival Hillary Clinton for not initially using the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d in describing the shooter\u2019s religious background. \u201cShe won\u2019t even utter the words,\u201d Trump said Monday. On Sunday, Trump had said Obama should \u201cstep down\u201d for not using the term and Clinton should \u201cget out of this race\u201d if she won\u2019t either. In remarks that were getting widespread attention Monday, Trump also made a vague statement about Obama interpreted by some as a reference to his sympathies. \u201cHe doesn't get it or, or he gets it better than anybody understands,\" Trump said. \"It's one or the other. And either one is unacceptable.\"\u00a0He later said Obama is either not tough and smart or has \u201csomething else in mind.\u201d Obama, speaking in the Oval Office after getting briefed on the investigation by top officials, said the U.S. has to go after terror groups and \u201chit them hard.\u201d He also said the U.S. needs to make it harder for those who wish to inflict harm to obtain weapons. Meanwhile, Obama said while the investigation is at the preliminary stages, \u201cWe see no clear evidence that he was directed externally.\u201d Rather, Obama said it appears the gunman was inspired by extremist information on the Internet. Speaking Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Clinton directly rejected Trump's criticism on their approach to terror attacks. \u201cI think Trump, as usual, is obsessed with name-calling and from my perspective, it matters what we do, not what we say,\" she said. \"It matters that we got bin Laden, not what name we called him. But if he is somehow suggesting I don't call this for what it is, he hasn't been listening.\u201d Clinton called the attack an \u201cact of terror\u201d on Sunday, as did Obama. But unlike Obama, who did not use the term \"radical Islam,\" Clinton elaborated on Monday and addressed some of the religious motivations. \u201cI have clearly said that we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to stop them and we will. We have to defeat radical jihadist terrorism, and we will. And to me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing. \u201cI'm happy to say either, but that's not the point. \u2026 I'm not going to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\u201d Clinton, who spoke as well on CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning,\u201d also said she would push for laws that prevent people on America's no-fly list from buying weapons. She also urged tougher restrictions on \"weapons of war,\" like the assault-style rifles used in Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif. \u2013 while saying she would set up a federal team dedicated exclusively to addressing \"lone wolf\" attacks. Trump later claimed credit on Twitter for Clinton referring to radical Islam. The attack has only fueled tensions in the 2016 race, as both Trump and Clinton launch into a general election battle after having effectively clinched their respective nominations. Trump has tried to cast Clinton as weak on security issues, while the presumptive Democratic nominee has described Trump as unfit to lead. Clinton will attend a campaign event in Ohio later Monday, while Trump is scrapping plans to make an anti-Clinton speech and instead delivering an address focused on terrorism, security and immigration Monday afternoon in New Hampshire. Trump told Fox News he\u2019ll be calling for strength, and calling for intelligence improvements in his speech. Further, of those in America \u201csick with hate,\u201d Trump said they need to be reported. \u201cNobody\u2019s reporting these people,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Southern California mom-of-two Jennifer Brawley had just been rear-ended by a truck driver near Rancho Cucamonga, and was preparing for the post-accident ritual of exchanging insurance information when the driver handed her his cellphone. A voice on the other end explained that his non-English speaking friend had no coverage. Police came to the scene and determined the driver had a valid license, and sent him on his way. Brawley, grateful to be unhurt, was nonetheless left with a feeling that something wasn\u2019t quite right. In the push to grant illegal immigrants driver\u2019s licenses, Californians had been assured that doing so would spur them to get safety training and insurance coverage. Nearly a year-and-a-half later, there\u2019s no evidence it worked. \u201cIt is hard to pinpoint whether the bill has had an impact or not,\u201d said Jeffrey Spring, spokesman for the American Automobile Association\u2019s California chapter. \u201cWe have no way of knowing.\u201d Brawley felt fortunate she was not hurt, but left with expensive repairs. The law, and a three-year, $141 million program designed to implement it, did not provide for a way to measure if illegal immigrants are any more inclined to buy insurance. \u201cThere are no statistics regarding how many new license holders under AB 60, purchased vehicle insurance,\u201d said California Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Artemio Armenta. \u201cWe cannot relate our vehicle insurance data to driver licenses because the vehicle registration information is only associated with individual vehicles and cannot be used to identify any trends related to AB 60. Drivers under AB 60 are not tracked or singled out any differently.\u201d More than 600,000 illegal immigrants got driver's licenses iin 2015. (Associated Press) \u201cThe DMV cannot relate our vehicle insurance data to driver licenses because the vehicle registration information is only associated with individual vehicles and cannot be used to identify any trends to AB 60,\u201d Armenta said. The DMV estimates that at least 1.4 million drivers will apply for a license over the next three years. As of March, the state had issued approximately 696,000 driver\u2019s licenses under the program. The program does not compel them to get auto insurance, and even if they get the coverage required to register a vehicle, they could stop paying premiums as many drivers do. \"I\u2019m sure some drivers bought insurance before they took their test but in many cases they just don\u2019t pay the next month and it\u2019s canceled,\" said anti-illegal immigration activist Don Rosenberg, whose son Drew was killed in 2010 in San Francisco by an unlicensed, uninsured driver who had entered the country illegally but was granted protective status. The law was part of a bundle of immigration measures designed to make California friendlier toward illegal immigrant residents. The state hired 1,000 temporary DMV workers, opened four new processing centers and extended hours in an effort to deal with the anticipated inundation onf the system \u2013 which was reportedly even higher than expected \u2013 as almost half a million applications came through in the first three months alone. It was clear that illegal immigrants wanted driver\u2019s licenses, but there is scant evidence supporters of the law were correct in saying it would spur them to get insurance. If licensed illegal immigrants want to buy auto insurance, the state provides a low-cost option. The California Department of Insurance markets the state-sponsored, Low Cost Auto Insurance Program for low income earners through Spanish-language media. Plans provide minimal liability coverage with annual premiums as low as $241. The coverage is less than what is mandated for other drivers who purchase policies through private insurance companies, paying a statewide average of just below $2,000 per year. Some 650,000 licenses were issued to illegal migrants in 2015 alone, and just 11,348 Californians \u2013 some illegal immigrants and some not - bought Low Cost Auto Insurance policies. Rosenberg and other critics say the subsidized insurance pays victims less than regular policies, leaving them with insufficient protection in the case of accidents caused by illegal immigrants, further undermining a major selling point of the law. \u201cPrior to this program California had the worst property damage coverage in the country and was tied for the third lowest payouts for injury or death,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cTo then offer a program that lowers the payouts even further and eliminates the safe driver criteria to enroll is unconscionable.\u201d Private insurance companies targeted advertising to an expected influx of illegal immigrant customers following passage of the law, but several contacted by FoxNews.com said there is no data to suggest such a market ever materialized. Some insurance company officials noted that despite the law\u2019s main selling point being that it would prompt illegal immigrants to get insurance, they were already allowed to by policies for cars they owned even without driver\u2019s licenses. According to the CDI, an estimated 25 insurance companies sold automobile insurance to those who owned cars but did not have a driver's license. \u201cIt is hard to quantify the effect the bill has had on the safety of California roads,\u201d said Mark Sektnan, president of the Association of California Insurance Companies. \u201cBut the summation is that many already had insurance before they could legally get a license.\u201d Possible evidence that more illegal immigrants are getting insurance could be reflected in numbers that show citations for driving without coverage on the decline. According to the California Highway Patrol, just over 92,000 drivers were cited for lacking proof of valid insurance in 2015, down from 105,500 the year before and 112,081 in 2013. But even those figures are inconclusive, as uninsured driver citations were on a downward trend for at least five years prior to passage of AB 60. \u201cThe bottom line is that the public was sold a lie,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cGetting a license does not mean you will get insurance and what little history there is says that most don\u2019t.\u201d",

Clinton cruised to easy victories in three of the six state contests on Tuesday \u2014 including delegate-rich New Jersey. With each win she further solidified Sen. Bernie Sanders' defeat and dashed his already slim chances of using the last night of state contests to refuel his flagging bid. The much-needed winning streak allowed Clinton to celebrate her long-sought \"milestone\" \u2014 the first woman poised to lead a major political party's presidential ticket. Standing before a flag-waving crowd in Brooklyn, the former secretary of state soaked up the cheers and beamed. \"Barriers can come down.

Still, Sanders had hoped to use a victory in California to persuade party insiders to switch their allegiances. Sanders picked up wins in Montana and North Dakota. But Clinton's substantial lead in California made it clear his effort was faltering. Sanders vowed to continue to his campaign to the very last contest in the District of Columbia on next Tuesday. \"The struggle continues,\" he said. Sanders is under intense pressure from top Democrats hoping to coax him gently out of the race, win over his voters and turn to the task of challenging Trump. Despite the pledge to solider on, there were signs Sanders was listening. In his typically passionate remarks, the socialist firebrand repeatedly noted \"we are in this together\" and argued that a base tenet of his campaign was that \"we will not allow right-wing Republicans to control our government.\" Sanders said he called Clinton to congratulate her on the victories. The senator is scheduled to return home to Burlington on Wednesday, before coming to Washington Thursday for meetings and a campaign rally. President Barack Obama called both Sanders and Clinton late Tuesday, congratulating both on their campaigns. The White House said Sanders and Obama would meet Thursday, at Sanders' request, to discuss \"how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters, and to build on that enthusiasm.\" Clinton and Sanders are also expected to connect in the coming days, Clinton's spokesman said late Tuesday. The candidates' campaign managers spoke earlier in the day, signaling that conversations were underway about the road ahead. As the Democratic race was wrapping up, Republicans were unraveling anew. Despite handily winning GOP contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota and Montana, presumptive nominee Trump was in damage control mode over his race-based attacks on a Hispanic judge that had party leaders in fits. After one senator rescinded his endorsement and House Speaker Paul Ryan called the comments \"racist,\" Trump sought to calm worries with a rare, scripted victory speech. \"I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down - too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears,\" Trump said, reading from a teleprompter at a rally at one of his golf courses in suburban New York City. \"I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that's what it is, is a movement.\" Trump went on to preview what Clinton has ahead of her: He blasted the former secretary of state and first lady as the defender of a \"rigged\" political system. He promised to deliver a longer speech on the Clintons \"probably Monday.\" \"The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. They've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars,\" he said. In her remarks, Clinton was similarly hard-edged, saying Trump was \"temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief.\" \"When he says let's make America great again, that's code for let's take America backward,\" she said. Clinton's moment came a day after she secured the necessary 2,383 delegates, according to the AP tally. Her victories on Tuesday added to the count, which includes pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses, as well as superdelegates \u2014 the party officials and officeholders who can back a candidate of their choosing. Sanders and some in his army of die-hard supporters expressed frustration about the survey. As he addressed supporters in Los Angeles, the crowd chanted \"Media is corrupt.\" Both Clinton and Trump made overtures toward an energized and passionate pool of voters. Trump noted he and Sanders both oppose the president's Pacific Rim trade deal, and he sympathized with frustration for having \"been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates.\" Clinton thanked the senator for driving the debate over economic mobility and income inequality and tried to show she absorbed some of his message. Mostly, she expressed empathy of a candidate who knows the bitter taste of defeat. \"It never feels good to put our heart into a cause or a candidate you believe in and come up short,\" she said. \"I know that feeling well. But as we look ahead to the battle that awaits, let's remember all that unites us.\" But for Clinton, the night was largely about marking the moment. Her campaign produced a video to introduce her speech, chronicling women's rise in politics from the suffragettes through Clinton's concession to speech to then-Sen. Barack Obama, eight years ago Tuesday when she thanked supporters for helping her put \"18 million cracks\" in the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling.\" Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed Saturday to deport \"criminal illegal immigrants ... within one hour\" of his inauguration if he is elected in November. Trump's promise, made during a speech in Iowa, came after several days of accusations that the real estate mogul had backed down on his signature issue to appeal to undecided general election voters. In an appearance on Fox News' \"Hannity\" Tuesday night, Trump told a town hall audience in Austin, Texas that he was open to \"softening\" current federal immigration law. \"There could certainly be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people,\" Trump said at the time. \"We want to follow the laws, you know, we have very strong laws in this country. And you know Bush, and even Obama, sends people back. Now, we can be more aggressive on that but we want to follow the laws.\" On Saturday, however, Trump said the media had \"missed the whole point on immigration ...\u00a0They take phrases and statements, chop them up, take them out of context and discuss them for days.\" Trump also said that he was developing an \"exit-entry tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas, that they're quickly removed.\" The proposal echoed the language of Trump's former primary rival, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is now advising him. \"My priority is the well-being of 300 million American citizens, including millions of Hispanic citizens and legal residents who want a secure border, and I mean secure,\" said Trump, who maintained his vow to build a wall across America's southern border. Trump touched off controversy during the GOP primary race by vowing to use a \u00a0\"deportation force\u201d to round up and deport millions of illegal immigrants. However, during his appearance on \"Hannity\" this week, Trump said his administration would be willing to \"work with\" illegal immigrants. \"They'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,\" Trump said. The Republican nominee's campaign has twice canceled scheduled speeches where Trump was expected to detail his immigration policy. Trump told Fox News Friday that he would deliver such a speech within the next two weeks. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Unless the president has a proposed law or action to take on the subject, jawboning on the subject seems very unlikely to change many minds on the subject. If the much more fraught case of Trayvon Martin couldn\u2019t change the national discourse, how is the Ferguson storyline going to do it? Obama\u2019s supporters have become kind of like Steely Dan aficionados, believing that if the unconvinced will just listen to \u201cBodhisattva\u201d just one more time, they too will be moved by the sound. But that\u2019s not how it works. Unless the president has something new to say, he is unlikely to get a new hearing from a skeptical nation. And based on the president\u2019s schedule today, there\u2019s not much new to come. [NYT Pentagon Correspondent Helene Cooper on NBC News discussing race riots: \u201cAs long as black people continue to feel that you cannot walk down the street without coming under suspicion, this anger is going to continue.\u201d]Shiny object alert - The president is slated for a full day of symbolic meetings on the issue of law enforcement in minority communities, including a cabinet meeting addressing the subject of \u201cmilitarization\u201d of police departments. The topic has political appeal across the spectrum, but that doesn\u2019t speak to what protestors are shutting down malls and highways at rush hour about. The claim from the Ferguson protesters is that police can kill black men with impunity and that \u201cblack lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d Obama is talking past those calling for action on that front. The militarization argument might come into play on the response to the protests, but certainly not their underlying cause. That is raw, divisive and cannot be addressed with a single executive order or even a single bill. Obama will also hold meetings with civil rights leaders and then law enforcement figures. But again, the question remains: To what end? [One of the prosed solutions for ethnic tensions between officers and citizens is to have more black officers. But as Heather Mac Donald has observed, some of the worst civil rights abuses have come from majority-black departments like New Orleans and Detroit.]That\u2019s soooo 2008\u2026 - The expectation that Obama is a magical being whose words and mere presence can bring healing and calm \u2013 a misconception he aggressively encouraged in his earlier days \u2013 create an impossible situation for the president. As long as there are those who believe that if Obama could just give the right speech and say the right sequence of words that these problems would abate, the president will always somehow be falling short of the mark. In reality, the president doesn\u2019t have many options when it comes to how local police and the residents of crime-wracked neighborhoods interact. The time for him to give \u2018major speeches\u201d to change the national discussion faded with his early clout as president. Now, he can talk but would be hard pressed to make the nation listen. And unless there is some policy prescription the president has roused himself to offer, this will be no exception.CONGRESS RETURNS AS CLIFF LOOMSCongress is back and so is the S-word, as in \u201cshutdown\u201d. \u00a0Lame duck lawmakers face a packed agenda and a looming Dec. 11 government funding deadline. In an atmosphere tainted by President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, Republican have been considering countermoves ranging from leveraging a shutdown \u2013 pushed by conservatives who want to defund Obama\u2019s amnesty edict \u2013 to full-funding through the current fiscal year, which party leaders say showcases the GOP\u2019s ability to govern. There\u2019s even a blended option afoot: Incoming House Budget Committee Rep. Tom Price last week floated a strategy that would fund most of the government through September 2015, like an omnibus, but would only fund immigration-related services for a few months. \u00a0Price sees it as a way to avoid a government shutdown, while blocking President Obama\u2019s executive action. \u00a0With the clock ticking and crucial items like renewal of tax breaks and defense funding on the to-do list, whichever tactical moves lawmakers employ will have little time to play out. [While Jonah Goldberg and A.B. Stoddard think the move unlikely, Goldberg made the point that if Republicans plan to use a shutdown as leverage, better to do so now than kick-the-can down the road. Watch their Power Play discussion with Chris Stirewalt, here.]Power Play: Cuellar on executive action - Immigration reform advocates have been rejoicing over President Obama\u2019s executive action which temporarily shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.

Patrick said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that ceding the Democratic nomination to the former secretary of State could turn off the electorate. Clinton \u201chas been an extraordinary public servant and would be a terrific candidate for president. But I think that the narrative that it's inevitable is off-putting to regular voters.\u201d He said that voters perceive \"inevitability as entitlement. And the American people want and ought to want their candidates to sweat for the job. You know, to actually make a case for why they're the right person at the right time.\u201d The outgoing state executive also said he would not make a run for the White House in 2016. \u201cI've thought about it, but no, I can't get ready for 2016,\u201d Patrick said.\u201dMaybe you would like to try \u201cNordic pine\u201d or \u201cfresh linen\u201d - The Hill: \u201cHillary Clinton has lost the \u2018new car smell\u2019 she might need to win the presidency in 2016, said Democratic pollster Doug Schoen on Sunday.\u00a0\u2018The president said [last week] that the next president needs \u2026 a new car smell, and it\u2019s pretty hard for me to say \u2026 that she [Hillary] has a new car smell,\u2019 Schoen told radio hostJohn Catsimatidis in an interview to air Sunday on New York's 970 AM\u2026\u201dFT: Hillary\u2019s bridge to White House looks \u201crickety\u201d - Financial Times: \u201cAs it stands, whatever coalition is expected to carry Mrs. Clinton over the finishing line is likely to result from a calculated process of addition.

After nearly two decades spent trying to launch his own career as a jazz pianist and songwriter in Chicago, New York and Hollywood, Rose headed south to Nashville in 1942. There, he partnered with Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff to establish the first music publishing house devoted to country music. Famous for square dealing and understanding country artists, it quickly became a major industry force. But Rose\u2019s skills at songwriting and developing artists proved so formidable that within three years, he brought his son aboard to handle the business side. Thank God he did. One of Roses\u2019 first projects was Hank Williams, who early on showed his own gifts as a songwriter. Their partnership helped bring forth much of Williams catalogue and make Williams an icon before his untimely death in 1953. Rose\u2019s list of songwriting credits includes eternal favorites like \u201cNo One Will Ever Know\u201d and many more, including several crossover hits. Rose would die from a heart attack on this date in 1954, leaving an unparalleled legacy in the business and art of country music. Rose was posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, along with Williams.

In her goodbye email to colleagues at Commerce, according to Defense One, Anderson wrote, \u201cThe decision to move to Commerce represented an exciting opportunity to branch into new territory. However, in light of the complex and vexing national security challenges facing the country, and with the knowledge that my deepest and most abiding commitments are to our security and defense, I have decided to return to that calling.\u201d Odds are Anderson goes back to work for her old boss, Ash Carter at the Pentagon.\u00a0Carter is well-respected on the Hill and probably won\u2019t have problems getting through Senator John McCain\u2019s Armed Services Committee. \u2013 Bret Baier Float on - \u201cOne name that\u2019s been floated around, he is not going to be happy to hear this, is Colin Powell\u2026Somebody who served -- as the chief military adviser in the first Gulf war, when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Secretary of State, somebody who\u2019s been the national security advisor.\u201d \u2013 Bob Woodward on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201dBut just in case, he\u2019ll leave his resume right here\u2026 - The Hill: \u201cRep.

If it came to that, it would be a difficult decision.\u2019\u201dCONSUMERS DEFY OBAMACARE ARCHITECTS\u2019 EXPECTATIONSA persistent set of problems for ObamaCare relates to missed expectations of incentives. One of the assumptions of the law was that beneficiaries would seek to save money each year by shopping around for the lowest premiums, creating incentives for insurance companies, like airlines, to offer lower rates. But your family doctor is not a flight to Des Moines and switching policies is not as simple as logging on to Kayak. The New Yorker explains how flawed thinking from the law\u2019s architects could further hamper promised savings: \u201cWhen switching costs are high, it\u2019s much easier for companies to raise prices. If you have a storage unit, you may well have been lured by an attractive monthly rate, only to find that it soon started rising by significant increments. (What are you going to do? Move all your stuff?) Similarly, even though there are lots of affordable new Obamacare plans this year, many of last year\u2019s are raising premiums substantially.\u201d [In the latest Gallup poll, 33 percent of Americans say they have delayed medical care for themselves or family members due to the costs.]Low turnout for ObamaCare small business program - WaPo: \u201cA year after the Obama administration\u00a0temporarily shelved\u00a0an unfinished part of HealthCare.gov intended for small businesses, it has opened with reports of only modest technical flaws, but with doubts that it will soon benefit the millions of workers at little companies with inadequate health insurance or none at all\u2026\u201dBLUE TEAM, INDEEDOn a bookstore shopping photo-op Saturday, President Obama spied a display of a book by NBC News anchor Chuck Todd with a cover featuring a photo of the president walking away with his eyes downcast, \u201cLet\u2019s see what Chuck has to say,\u201d the president said as he leaned closer. \u201cThe Stranger, Barack Obama in the White House,\u201d he read aloud. \u201cHow is he already writing a book?\u201d Malia asked her father, with a smile. \u201cLooking lonely.

He\u2019s so sad,\u201d the president remarked amusedly. \u201cIt looks like a sad book,\u201d Malia agreed. \u201cThey tried to find the saddest photo,\u201d a woman at the counter chimed in. \u201cI know,\u201d President Obama said, chuckling. Perhaps if Todd had a more nourishing diet\u2026\u2018SINCE THEN WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY SEEN THE SQUIRREL\u2026\u2019Recess was cut short at one British elementary school thanks to an \u201cunusually aggressive\u201d grey squirrel reports the Daily Mail. Students were escorted back into the building after a teacher at the Hertfordshire school spotted the rambunctious rodent wreaking havoc on the playground. No children were hurt in the incident, though one staff member received a scratch. Head teacher Amrit Bal-Richards is monitoring the situation though the ferocious fellow hasn\u2019t been seen since, saying, \u201cThe incident was a couple of weeks ago, since then we have not actually seen the squirrel. Safeguarding children is paramount. It is uncommon for a squirrel to actually demonstrate aggressive behavior but we are aware of the situation.\u201d The school held an assembly for students to discuss the incident and what to do in the future if squirrels or other animals become agitated or threatened.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0 Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

            "article_content": "'Fox News Sunday' exclusive interview with Donald Trump's campaign manager Top Donald Trump aide Corey Lewandowski on Sunday defended Trump\u2019s recent criticism of New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a fellow Republican, and deflected a host of other complaints about Trump's presidential campaign, saying the real issues are jobs and the economy. \u201cThe governor is not doing the job,\u201d Lewandowski said about Martinez on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d in a sharp exchange with host Chris Wallace. \u201cLet\u2019s get it right. \u2026 This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democratic issue. We stand by our statement.\u201d Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, is being chastised by party leaders and others for attacking a Latino Republican governor, in her home state, particularly when Republicans sorely need the minority and female vote to win the general election. \"Your governor has got to do a better job,\" Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Albuquerque, hitting Martinez on high state unemployment and other issues. \"She's not doing the job. Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico. I'll get this place going.\" The remarks quelled speculation that Trump might pick Martinez, also chairman of the Republican Governors Association, as his running mate and brought to her defense such GOP leaders as House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Martinez endorsed for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Martinez's office responded by telling reporters in a statement: \"Apparently, Donald Trump doesn't realize Governor Martinez wasn't elected in 2000, that she has fought for welfare reform, and has strongly opposed the president's Syrian refugee plan.\" Lewandowski on Sunday argued the real issues are jobs, the economy and immigration. \u201cWe need to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to put people back to work, cut taxes. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d Lewandowski also argued his purported disputes with fellow top campaign adviser Paul Manafort are media hype, saying they speak several times daily and work together on key decisions. He also defended Trump\u2019s decision not to debate Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, suggesting the billionaire businessman was joking when he brought up the idea. Lewandowski said the campaign is \u201csolely focused\u201d on beating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to waste our time debating Bernie Sanders when he\u2019s not going to be the nominee,\u201d he said. Sanders said Friday night on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d that he would still \u201clove\u201d to debate Trump and essentially asked him to reconsider. \u201cTrump claims to be a real tough guy, pushes people around. Hey Donald, come on up and let's debate about the future of America,\" Sanders said. Lewandowski also defended against criticism that the campaign staff is too small to win a general election against one as deep and far-reaching as Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been leaner with better results,\u201d said Lewandowski, arguing the campaign won\u2019t have 700 or 800 people, like Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe spent less money, got better results.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Reaction on 'The Kelly File' to the latest document dumps WASHINGTON \u2013 Hillary Clinton told bankers behind closed doors that she favored \"open trade and open borders\" and said Wall Street executives were best-positioned to help reform the U.S. financial sector, according to transcripts of her private, paid speeches leaked Friday. The leaks were the result of another email hacking intended to influence the presidential election. Excerpts of the speeches given in the years before her 2016 presidential campaign included some blunt and unguarded remarks to her private audiences, which collectively had paid her at least $26.1 million in speaking fees. Clinton had refused to release transcripts of the speeches, despite repeated calls to do so by her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. The excerpts were included in emails exchanged among her political staff, including Campaign Chairman John Podesta, whose email account was hacked. The WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of Podesta's emails. It wasn't immediately clear who had hacked Podesta's emails, though the breach appeared to cover years of messages, some sent as recently as last month. Among the emails was a compilation of excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches in 2013 and 2014. It appeared campaign staff had read all Clinton's speeches and identified passages that could be potentially problematic for the candidate if they were to become public. One excerpt put Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has retreated on significantly during the 2016 election. In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her \"dream\" is \"a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\" and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \"would mean for everybody in this room.\" Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has made opposition to trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign. Podesta posted a series of tweets Friday night, calling the disclosures a Russian hack and raising questions about whether some of the documents could have been altered. \"I'm not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\" Podesta wrote. \"Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\" Podesta's comments came just hours after U.S. officials publicly accused the Russian government of directing cyberattacks on political organizations and American citizens in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections. The joint statement from the office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department cited disclosures of \"alleged hacked emails\" on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks as being \"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\" The statement didn't refer by name to the affected political institutions, but federal authorities are investigating cyberattacks on the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, \"It's not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret.\" The emails released Friday included exchanges between Podesta and other Clinton insiders, including campaign manager Robby Mook. Most were routine, including drafts of Clinton speeches, suggested talking points for campaign surrogates and suggested tweets to be sent out from Clinton's account. The excerpts include quotes from an October 2013 speech at an event sponsored by Goldman Sachs, in which Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. \"Running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it,\" Clinton said. \"New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it's also our economic center. And there are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.\" In the same speech, Clinton was also deferential to the New York finance industry, exhorting wealthy donors to use their political clout for patriotic rather than personal benefit. She also spoke of the need to include Wall Street perspectives in financial reform. \"The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\" Clinton said. In an April 2013 speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council, Clinton said politicians must balance \"both a public and a private position\" while making deals. Clinton gave an example from the movie \"Lincoln,\" and the deal-making that went into passage of the 13th Amendment, a process she compared to sausage-making. \"It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be,\" Clinton said. \"But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\" Clinton's speeches often touched on technology and privacy. In an April 2014 speech to JPMorgan, she denounced National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for going abroad, saying, \"if he really cared about raising some of these issues and stayed right here in the United States, there's a lot of whistleblower protections.\" But she told her audience that her time in the public eye left her sympathetic to privacy concerns. \"As somebody who has had my privacy scrutinized and violated for decades, I'm all for privacy, believe me,\" she said. Speaking on international affairs, Clinton's comments were largely in line with her positions as secretary of state, if sometimes more blunt. \"The Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on Earth over the course of the last 30 years,\" she told the Jewish United Fund at a 2013 dinner. The speech transcripts were produced under an agreement Clinton routinely imposed on any organization that hired her to speak. The contracts, such as ones crafted by the Harry Walker Agency, required the organizations to hire, at their own expense, a stenographer who would provide the transcripts to Clinton and not keep copies for themselves. In some cases, the contracts themselves were obtained by news organizations under public records laws because Clinton was being paid to speak by public universities or colleges.",

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (The Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 The Latest on a Mormon conference in Salt Lake City (all times local): 12:05 p.m. A Mormon leader is cautioning members not to succumb to rebellion, which would keep them out of heaven. J. Devn Cornish of the faith's second-tier of worldwide leaders spoke Saturday during a church conference in Salt Lake City about sin and repentance. Cornish said members can be forgiven for sins if they sincerely repent, but reminded that consequences of their actions sometimes linger. He spoke sternly about rebellion, saying Satan was cast of heaven for rebelling. He also told members that \"the worst kind of sin is premeditated sin where one says, I can sin now and repent later.'\" Cornish delivered his speech during a twice-yearly conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in which leaders provide spiritual instruction and guidance to members in attendance or watching live broadcasts. ____ 11:15 a.m. A Mormon leader is urging members of the Utah-based religion not to be timid about defending church founder Joseph Smith's story. Craig Christensen of the faith's second-tier of worldwide leaders spoke Saturday during a church conference in Salt Lake City about members struggling with \"erroneous, misleading or superficial information\" about Smith. He told members to remember the many benefits that have come in the nearly 200 years since Smith, then a teenager, says he had a vision of God and Jesus Christ in the woods of upstate New York that led to the formation of the church 10 years later. Christensen didn't reference any specific misinformation about Smith, though critics have long questioned Smith's accounts of his visions and his account that God helped him translate gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian into the Book of Mormon. Leaders give speeches of spiritual guidance and sometimes announce new church initiatives during the twice-yearly conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'. ____ 12:11 a.m. Mormons are gathering in Salt Lake City to listen to speeches from church leaders at a twice-yearly conference. More than 100,000 members of the faith are expected to attend five sessions in Salt Lake City that span Saturday and Sunday. Thousands more will listen or watch around the world on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' conference comes amid an intense presidential election in the U.S. and as members around the world grapple with the increasing needs of refugees. Church leaders could talk more about their push to be welcoming toward refugees at a time when some others are tightening the hatches. Mormon leaders are not expected to mention presidential candidates by name, but they could advocate again for public civility and compassion.",

            "article_content": "2016 candidate speaks out on 'America's Newsroom,' says president does not understand ISIS threat President Obama threatened late Wednesday to veto legislation aimed at improving screening for Syrian refugees, potentially putting the White House and Congress on a collision course in a matter of days. The veto threat came as the House was preparing the bill -- which sets high hurdles for refugee admission including FBI background checks and sign-offs by top officials -- for floor action as early as Thursday. In a committee meeting, Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, accused the president of confusing the public about the intentions of the legislation. Moments later, the White House issued a statement defending the current screening process and claiming the changes called for under the bill would create \"significant delays and obstacles\" for the existing vetting program. \"Given the lives at stake and the critical importance to our partners in the Middle East and Europe of American leadership in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis ... [Obama] would veto the bill,\" the White House said. But House Republicans touted the legislation as a common-sense answer to security concerns. Further, while Republicans a day earlier called for a \"pause\" in Syrian refugee admissions, some on Wednesday indicated a willingness to accept refugees from Syria and Iraq who are fleeing the civil war and Islamic State militants -- provided the screening process is improved, under the terms of the bill. \"America has a proud tradition of welcoming refugees into our country, and we lead the world in humanitarian assistance. However, we also must put proper measures in place to ensure our country's safety,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement. The bill introduced Wednesday would require the FBI director to certify a background investigation for each refugee -- and several top security officials to certify that each refugee is not a security threat to the U.S. -- before a refugee from Iraq or Syria can be admitted. House Speaker Paul Ryan said the chamber would vote on the bill later this week, and stressed that it would not subject applicants to a religious test. He made this clarification after some GOP presidential candidates suggested preference should be given to Christians. McCaul, in a statement, said that while he wants a \"temporary suspension\" of Syrian refugee admissions, \"It is apparent that the President will ignore these concerns, making this legislation necessary to toughen security measures.\" Indeed, Obama on Wednesday continued to defend plans to bring in an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year as he threatened to veto the House bill. \"Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do,\" Obama tweeted late Wednesday morning. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., also touted the latest House bill, saying it was based on legislation he introduced just days earlier. Hudson said the new bill would likely be voted on in the House on Thursday. \"America is a compassionate nation. No country on Earth does more or spends more to care for our fellow man. But being compassionate doesn't mean we have to have reckless policies that put American lives at risk,\" he said in a statement. McCaul's committee also released a report Wednesday on the Syrian refugee flow, saying it reveals \"alarming gaps in the vetting of Syrian refugees at home and abroad.\" Already, the new legislation was facing criticism from both sides of the aisle -- and not just the White House. Heritage Action executive officer Michael A. Needham said in a statement that the bill, while setting up better vetting, \"provides no leverage for Congress to weigh in and relies solely on President Obama's appointees to carry out the new vetting process.\" House Democrats also voiced opposition, with one House Democratic leadership aide telling Fox News the bill would \"end the refugee program altogether.\" The aide said they hope to \"negotiate a bipartisan bill\" and are weighing introducing an \"alternative bill.\" Meanwhile, CIA Director John Brennan said in a speech Wednesday that about half of Syria's population -- or about 12 million people -- has been displaced by the ISIS onslaught and the civil war, a number that includes both those who have been internally displaced and those forced to flee the country. Speaking at the Overseas Security Advisory Council Conference, Brennan said Syria is \"approaching 50 percent of the population\" that has been displaced.

            "article_content": "AP (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) Can money buy an election? Hillary Clinton better hope so. Thanks to Director Comey\u2019s bombshell announcement that the FBI is reopening the investigation into Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information, a close race will almost surely tighten further. Hillary goes into the home stretch under pressure, with lagging enthusiasm and falling \u201cfavorables\u201d, but with this to fall back on: piles of cash. Comey\u2019s announcement may cause a shift in the polls, but the more important impact could be on turnout. By reminding Americans of what they most dislike about Hillary Clinton \u2013 the scandals that trail her like a sulfurous cloud \u2013 the renewed FBI probe could cause tepid Hillary supporters to stay home. At the same time, it arguably reenergizes the Trump camp, whose followers have been depressed by sinking polls and the media\u2019s suggestion that the race was already decided. Throughout the campaign, the Clinton camp has worried that the so-called Obama coalition would simply not show up; surrogates including President and Mrs. Obama have repeatedly urged blacks, in particular, to vote. There are signs that those fears were well founded. In North Carolina, for example, black voting is lagging 2012 levels. Similarly, a brand new poll shows Clinton\u2019s advantage over Millenials shrinking. Elsewhere, the New York Times reports Clinton has a slim edge in several toss-up states, and acknowledges that she has a \u201clarge organizational advantage.\u201d That advantage is the result of a sturdy years-long Democratic program dedicated to voter turnout, and also the Trump camp\u2019s refusal to invest in the nuts-and-bolts efforts so critical to national campaigns. Hillary\u2019s ground game, fueled by her constant schmoozing with billionaire donors, could make the difference in this election. For all that she rails at the evils of \u201cdark money\u201d on the campaign trail, Hillary and her SuperPacs have raised over one billion dollars in this election cycle, compared to only $512 million for Trump. \u00a0In the first three weeks of October, Clinton kept up a relentless fund-raising program, pulling in $52 million compared to Trump\u2019s $29 million. Even after a heavy bout of advertising, Clinton\u2019s campaign ended the period with $62 million left in the kitty while Trump had only $16 million. So strapped is his team that Trump has announced that he is writing a ten million dollar check to his campaign; he may need it. Ironically, with Hillary clearly ahead in the polls for the last two weeks, her campaign seemed to have briefly taken its foot off the accelerator. In these closing days, and after months of being outspent 3:1, Trump was set to spend slightly more than his Democrat rival on TV ads for the first time ($14.4 million vs. $13.9 million).\u00a0 Trump\u2019s camp, in a last-ditch effort, is ramping up its TV presence in swing states Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. By contrast, Clinton\u2019s team for the first time bought more than $100,000 in ads to air in Wisconsin, where most polls show she has a secure lead of five or six points. Her Wisconsin campaign director explained that the ads were designed in part to boost other Democrats like former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold who is battling incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. Clinton\u2019s team is also dedicating millions to Indiana and Missouri, where Trump has a comfortable lead but where senate seats are up for grabs. Taking control of the Senate is a high priority for Democrats; Hillary\u2019s campaign apparently thought she could afford to share her wealth. Even more surprising was the Clinton camp\u2019s modest ad buy in Texas, a red state for generations, but where the Dallas Morning News, for the first time since 1936, endorsed the Democratic candidate. It seemed that Hillary was almost taunting Trump, and hoping he would divert his scarce resources to what is normally a Republican stronghold. Now the tables are turned, and Hillary will have to refocus her millions on the get-out-the vote push. There is no question Clinton\u2019s field operation tops Trump\u2019s. In Ohio she has 300 staffers while Trump has fewer than half that number. In Florida, as of September, Trump had one office to Clinton\u2019s 51. These \u00a0\u00a0advantages will make or break Clinton now. Clinton\u2019s hefty checking account will fund more phone banks, more flyers and more buses to deliver supporters to the polling places on Election Day. Will it be enough? Obama adviser David Axelrod said in an interview that Clinton\u2019s ground game and consequent advantage in turning out voters could add 1 to 3 percent in swing states. As we head into the home stretch, with a number of states within the margin of error, that could make the difference. The songwriters could be wrong: maybe money can buy you love.",

            "article_content": "William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles Federal lawmakers seeking to pinpoint the number of illegal immigrants who successfully sneak across the southern border ordered up a report from the Department of Homeland Security, but the agency refuses to release it and instead cites a misleading statistic that overstates the number who are nabbed, sources told Fox News. DHS denied it is holding back the report, but sources say it was completed in November and that it shows roughly half of adults who attempt to cross the border make it - approximately 250,000 in total. But that number is at odds with DHS\u2019 official estimates. The agency claims authorities catch 80 percent of adults trying to sneak in, but critics say the figure is padded to make it appear border security is more effective than it really is. \"The Obama administration knows that the number of illegal aliens successfully getting across the Mexican border is 158 percent higher than they are telling people,\" said John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, who assessed the statistics for Fox News. \"The administration has made fraudulent changes in the numbers to hide this.\" If released by the Obama administration, the true numbers could have major implications in the current presidential race, in which illegal immigration and border security have become a key issue, say observers. One source familiar with the report told Fox News that DHS is suppressing the report for \"political reasons . . . because it would 'look bad' and 'help elect Donald Trump.\u201d Republican lawmakers are furious that the report they ordered is not being released. \u201cIt erodes the trust as to whether the administration is being honest with the American people about what the threat is,\u201d said Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., who serves on the Committee on Homeland Security and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. \u201cThis should not be a partisan issue. Democrats, Independents and Republicans in my community want to make sure that border communities are safe.\u201d The report was requested by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees as part of the Fiscal 2016 Omnibus Bill, but has been shrouded in secrecy. Viewed by a select few in key administration figures, critics say it is being withheld because of its explosive findings, which could potentially benefit GOP nominee Donald Trump. FoxNews.com requested a copy from both DHS and the White House, but was told the report is not yet finished, an assertion disputed by sources familiar with the process. \u201cAny suggestion that DHS is delaying release of a report on new border enforcement measures for political reasons is false,\u201d a DHS spokesperson told Fox News. \u201cTo the contrary, at Secretary Johnson\u2019s direction, DHS has been making significant progress in the development of such measures. At this point, however, the work is still preliminary and requires further refinement, to ensure the new measures are accurate and reliable. \u201cThe November 2015 report purportedly obtained by Fox News is one building block provided by a research organization DHS has been working with to develop these measures,\" the spokesperson added. The study was written by analysts from DHS and the outside firm Institute for Defense Analyses, and is the most extensive survey of illegal activity and U.S. enforcement at the southwest border to date. Researchers went to the southwest border three times over 9 months and conducted independent surveys of Mexican migrants caught by the Border Patrol. They also reviewed Border Patrol intelligence, internal DHS records, apprehensions at ports of entry and detention records. The report was peer reviewed by a number of experts. The document examines, in part, the Interdiction Effectiveness Rate (IER), or the number of adults caught at the border by law enforcement. But when DHS briefed members of the House and Senate earlier this year, sources familiar with the report say it was blended with non-IER statistics, such as unaccompanied children and those who surrendered to Border Patrol. Those figures were used to buttress the claim that only 20 percent of would-be illegal immigrants are successful when the real IER estimation was half, sources said. \u201cThere is a distrust, because of the shifting measurements,\u201d McSally said. \u201cWe would like to follow up with those researchers and better understand what is going on related to suppressing those results, if that\u2019s an accurate report.\u201d It is concerning, but not surprising, that the Obama administration has kept secret this credible research, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy research for the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cIt appears to me that this research could have been suppressed because it contradicts the Obama administration\u2019s narrative that the border is secure, and it contradicts the administration\u2019s wish for people to believe that illegal immigration is a thing of the past,\u201d Vaughan said. The taxpayer-funded research should be released to the public and available for review by experts, said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a co-author of the CFR report, \u201cManaging Illegal Immigration to the United States: How Effective is Enforcement.\u201d \u201cHow can we expect Congress to make decisions on border enforcement if it doesn\u2019t know how many people are entering illegally, if it doesn't know the apprehension rate, if it doesn\u2019t know the detection rate\u2026. what percentage of people the border patrol is seeing,\u201d Alden said. \u201cAll of these are critical variables about making intelligence decisions about border enforcement and they simply at the moment are not in the hands of the Congress and the public.\u201d The irony is the data, by and large, reveals what appears to be a \u201cgood news\u201d story, Alden said. \u201cWe have seen a significant decline in illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States and it's clear that the Border enforcement build-up has been a big reason why that decline has been as sharp as it has been,\u201d Alden said. \u201cOur estimates suggest that the number of successful illegal entries has fallen from extremely high numbers -- more than 3 million annually up to the mid-2000s -- to much, much smaller numbers, about 250,000 last year. Keep in mind that these numbers do not represent individuals who came to stay in the United States \u2013 these are the total number of illegal border crossings.\u201d The numbers have fallen dramatically in recent years partly due to economic and demographic changes, such as a smaller population of young Mexicans looking for work, Alden said. But enforcement also has played a significant role because the odds of getting caught while crossing have gone up and, more importantly, the consequences for getting caught are much greater, he acknowledged. The Institute for Defense Analyses report is not classified or marked in any way and can be publicly disseminated without restriction, sources said. But the chances of it getting out look dim, as a decades-old report also commissioned by DHS -- the 2006 \"CBP Apprehensions at the Border\" study prepared by the Homeland Security Institute -- also has never been released.",

Israel is planning to bolster its high-tech arsenal by deploying fully autonomous military vehicles along the country\u2019s dangerous border with Gaza. \u201cThis is the future -- the border is a very dangerous place,\u201d an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official told FoxNews.com, citing the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), snipers, anti-tank missiles and terrorist tunnels. \u201cSending unmanned vehicles to do these patrols means that troops lives\u2019 are not at risk.\u201d Working with Israeli defense specialist Elbit Systems, IDF has equipped Ford F-350 pickup trucks with specialized remote driving technology. The trucks, dubbed Border Protector Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), are also fitted with four driving cameras and a 360-degree observation camera to help operators identify threats. At the moment, the vehicles are unarmed. UGV testing began in July 2015 and the trucks became operational in February. The Border Protector UGV (Israel Defense Forces). Currently, each vehicle is driven by an operator in a remote control room using a steering wheel, joystick and pedals. In the next few months, the Israeli Army aims to deploy the UGVs semi-autonomously, with the vehicle driving toward a map coordinate set by its operator. The trucks, however, will still need their operators to guide them around any obstacles in their path. Longer-term, the trucks will need less human intervention. \u201cIn the future, we will have the capability of fully autonomous driving,\u201d the IDF official added, noting that the UGVs will autonomously navigate any obstacles in their path. Troops can also drive the UGVs traditionally from the driver\u2019s seat. IDF declined to reveal how many UGVs are in operation or the exact timeframe for autonomous operation. Plans are also in place to add a weapon to the vehicle. \u201cWe think at the beginning of next year, we will get a machine gun on the vehicle that will be operated from a control room \u2013 the machine gun will not be autonomous,\u201d said the IDF official. The UGV replaces the semi-autonomous Guardium vehicle that was deployed by Israeli forces in 2009. \u201cThe Guardium was unable to navigate obstacles by itself, but the UGV will be able to,\u201d explained the official. The Israeli Army wants to eventually deploy the UGVs on Israel\u2019s other borders with Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel is not the only country looking to harness autonomous military vehicles. The U.S. Army, for example, recently tested driverless vehicle technology in Michigan. The Army\u2019s Tank Automotive Research and Development Center (TARDEC) also showcased one of its autonomous vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show earlier this year.

            "article_content": "San Francisco lawmaker wants to allow undocumented parents to vote in school board elections After two failed bids to grant voting rights to illegal immigrants, some San Francisco officials believe they have found the man who can make it happen: Donald Trump. A proposed charter amendment drafted by Board of Supervisors member Eric Mar would give illegal immigrants with kids in the public school system the right to vote in school elections. Voters have rejected two previous ballot proposals, but Mar is betting on anti-Trump sentiment to carry the pro-illegal immigrant proposal if he can get it on the November ballot. \u201cWith Donald Trump\u2019s racist and anti-immigrant sentiments, there is a reaction from many of us who are disgusted by those politics,\" Mar said. \"I think that\u2019s going to ensure there is strong Latino turnout as well as other immigrant turnout.\u201d Mar is hoping anti-Trump sentiment will get his measure passed. A key promise in Trump's campaign for the Republican nomination for president has been to build a wall on the Mexican border. This week, Trump claimed a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University wouldn\u2019t be impartial because he is of Mexican heritage. Mar staffers confirmed the measure will go before the rules committee within weeks, and could then be presented to the full board of supervisors. If a majority support it, the charter amendment will be on the ballot Nov. 8 when the city and nation votes for president. \u201cThe time is right for San Francisco to make history, to pave the way for immigrant parents to have a say in the policy decisions that impact their child\u2019s education and who gets to sit on the Board of Education,\u201d Mar said in a written statement. In 2004, voters narrowly rejected the same proposal. A similar measure, introduced by California Assemblymember David Chiu, D-San Francisco, failed in 2010 with just 46 percent of the vote. Chiu believes Trump's presence on the ballot, and the fact that one of every three children in the system is now the child of an immigrant parent could make the third time a charm. \u201cWith the anti-immigrant rhetoric from Donald Trump, it is more important than ever that we come together as San Franciscans to stand up for our immigrant communities and support their civic engagement,\u201d Chiu said in a written statement. The plan is \u201cbad public policy,\u201d according to Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Federal Elections Commission member. \u201cIt is wrong to extend the vote to individuals who have not entered the American social compact or made a commitment to the our Constitution, our law, and our cultural and political heritage by becoming citizens,\u201d von Spakovsky said. \u201cIt is even worse to extend the franchise to illegal aliens whose very first act is to violate our laws; that encourages contempt for the law.\u201d While laws in all 50 states bar noncitizens from voting in state elections, and federal law makes it a felony for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, there is an opening in local elections, von Spakovsky acknowledged. Seven jurisdictions - including 6 in Maryland and one in Chicago \u2013 afforded voting rights to noncitizens, Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at Queens College of the City University of New York, told the Chronicle.",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from \"Angry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America\u2014and What We Can All Do to Save the Middle Class\" (Skyhorse Publishing, August 23, 2016) Ultra-liberal Democrats and the mainstream media (I know, I repeat myself) cannot understand why white voters, particularly white men, are so angry. Well, I\u2019m going to share with you the raw, politically incorrect truth. It\u2019s an indictment of a president and system practicing reverse racism and overt discrimination\u2014in plain sight for all to see. First, there is no doubt that blacks, minorities, and people of color had it rough for many decades. Women, especially in the workplace, had the system tilted against them. We get it. And during the past hundred years, especially the last sixty, the vast majority of us fought hard to eliminate it. No one can deny the terrible things done to blacks: slavery; discrimination in jobs and housing; poll taxes; and \u201cWhites Only\u201d signs in front of bathrooms, pools, water fountains, and restaurant counters. The list of wrongs and grievances is long and real. But that was then, and this is now. And two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. The sorry truth is that the pendulum has swung way too far in the other direction. It has gotten to a point where virtually every action, law, and utterance out of our nation\u2019s first black president\u2019s mouth is intended to denigrate or damage the predominantly white middle class. Or haven\u2019t you noticed? Let me start with the obvious. Suicide Studies and polls show blacks and people of color are relatively happy and unchanged in their satisfaction level for decades. Yet under Obama, America is in the middle of a massive suicide epidemic. Who is committing all this suicide? White middle-aged Americans.1 In other words, the white middle class and \u201cangry white males\u201d are so unhappy they are killing themselves. We should be worried about \u201cWhite Lives Matter.\u201d But, of course, then we would be called \u201cracist.\u201d Is the liberal view it\u2019s \u201call in our heads\u201d? Or could some- thing actually be wrong? Do liberals think an entire race has suffered a dramatic increase in depression and suicide because life is so easy and great for white people? Because we have such fantastic advantages? Because great jobs, perfect relationships, and wealth just appear out of thin air or fall out of trees for white people? Or could this depression, anger, and suicide be the result of no jobs or only menial, crappy, low-wage jobs; or a dramatic drop in our incomes and assets; or dramatic increases in taxes, health insurance, electric bills, grocery bills, and college bills\u2014 all of which has made it virtually impossible to provide for our families. The fact is that our own government is destroying the middle class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility. The predominantly white middle class has been sacrificed to give welfare and free health care to everyone else. And to add insult to injury, \u201ceveryone else\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean other, less fortunate fellow citizens who most of us want to help; it also means every illegal alien who can walk across the border, many of whom hate us and the whole concept of America. Result? We\u2019re killing ourselves. That might have something to do with it. In other words, for your typical middle-class American, life sucks. Under Obama and the political elites, the quality of middle-class life has been gutted, and the American Dream of upward mobility is dead. And who makes up this great American middle class? Predominantly white people. Ironically, the crux of the liberal argument is that white people have all the money, power, and high-paying jobs and own all the businesses. Yet when laws and policies are passed to redistribute their money to those who are poor and dependent, liberal politicians, intellectuals, and the media refuse to admit these policies are nothing more than reverse racism and discrimination. These policies are a sign of ignorance and stupidity, especially as to how an economy works. A study of every socialist country in world history shows that \u201cfairness, equality, and social justice\u201d leads to devastating widespread poverty and shared misery. Venezuela is the most recent example that big government tax-and-spend policies lead to economic collapse, food shortages, and no toilet paper. Hotels ask guests to BYOTP\u2014\u201cbring your own toilet paper.\u201d2 Gotta love big government, huh? It doesn\u2019t just kill spirit, or kill people, it even kills toilet paper! The only thing every country basing its economy on diversity, social justice, and affirmative action has succeeded in is making the powerful, political elites filthy rich and making everyone else poor. Liberal (i.e., socialist) policies lead to economic disaster. No one is lifted up, everyone is torn down, and the middle class, not the wealthy, are the ones who suffer. Sound like what is happening right now in America? Obama and his progressive crony elites in the media and Congress have spent almost eight years conducting a massive, radical experiment basing our economy on \u201cdiversity, equality, and social justice.\u201d The result? Obama has succeeded in destroying America\u2019s middle class, just like every other country that ever tried to legislate equality. And that middle class happens to be overwhelmingly white. Was it worth it? Did income redistribution\u2014that is, taking money and jobs away from small business and the overwhelmingly white middle class with massive taxes and regulations, onerous Obamacare, and climate change costs\u2014 and all the spending on entitlements and debt, actually benefit black Americans? You tell me. The fact is our first black president has overseen the greatest inequality in history: Black unemployment is now double that of white unemployment. Poverty is back to 1960s levels, while welfare, food stamps, and disability have hit all-time record highs. Black violence and murder rates in inner city urban areas are spiraling out of control. Predominantly black cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore are not only bankrupt, they\u2019re war zones. Violence on inner city streets has risen to unprecedented levels. Who are the victims? Black Americans. Obama has spent more, handed out more entitlements, more welfare, more food stamps, and now more debt than any president in history. Yet the economy is miserable and the only true measurement of economic growth\u2014gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014is near zero. Obama is the only president to ever preside over seven straight years of GDP under 3 percent. Not even Herbert Hoover or FDR in the depths of the Great Depression produced an economic record as miserable and pathetic as Obama. It\u2019s an economic record of futility, which, like Joe DiMaggio\u2019s fifty-six-game hitting streak, will never be matched! The result: 63 percent of Americans can\u2019t come up with $500 in case of an emergency.3 The wealth gap between white and black Americans is wider today than in the 1960s when the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d began.4 Amazingly, along with driving white and black Americans into bankruptcy and poverty, Obama will have added a world-record $10 trillion to the debt (by the time he leaves office). That\u2019s money that has to be paid back by the middle class for decades to come, thereby guaranteeing a shrinking middle class in crisis long after Obama is gone. And you wonder why we\u2019re angry? Obama\u2019s success in fundamentally changing America looks exactly like the situation in every communist, socialist, and third-world country\u2014inequality, massive poverty, shared misery, and no middle class. Thank you, Obama: you\u2019ve turned America into a third-world mess. Sadly, Obama had a golden opportunity to be a leader and make America a truly color-blind nation. I believe it is a major reason so many Americans voted for him and is what even those of us who didn\u2019t support him had great hope he would do. Instead, he\u2019s produced the worst race relations since the 1960s.5 Now, let\u2019s go a step deeper. Let\u2019s examine specific Obama policies that are clearly aimed right at the heart of white America. You wonder why white America is angry? Liberals can\u2019t understand why white America is outraged, shocked, and feels betrayed, denigrated, and discriminated? Here it is. Hiring Employees in the Private Sector How many Americans are aware that the Obama administration sued major corporations to ban them from using criminal background checks on black job applicants? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had the anti-white, outright racist audacity to argue that criminal background checks for whites are perfectly acceptable, but corporations should be banned from checking on the criminal records of blacks. Why? Because, they argued, black males are so likely to have a criminal record, they would never be hired. So business owners have no right to know the back- ground of the person they\u2019re hiring to handle money and deal with valued customers? According to Obama, drug dealers, pimps, and rapists should wait on your female customers. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Hiring of Government Employees Not content to strike out with his order in the private sector, President Obama signed an Executive Order in December of 2015 to \u201cban the box.\u201d6 This means federal agencies can no longer ask prospective job applicants about their criminal history. Amazingly, what this means is government employees paid with your taxpayer money (often at a higher rate than a similar job in the private sector) will now include convicted criminals. The government is using your taxes to pay convicted criminals to oversee your life. Wait, it gets better. Government employees at agencies like the IRS, the National Security Agency (NSA), and Social Security have access to highly confidential financial information that can be stolen and sold to thieves and frauds (or people looking to blackmail politicians into voting for bigger government). Doesn\u2019t it make sense that an applicant\u2019s criminal background should at least be considered? Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Housing Are you aware that the Obama administration has told land- lords they have no right to reject a potential tenant based on a criminal record? Property owners are now obligated by law to rent to known murderers, rapists, drug dealers, pimps, carjackers, and home-invasion robbers. The administration admitted that this law is to protect criminals because they hap- pen to be predominantly black. As always, Obama\u2019s Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department plays the race card by saying if you refuse to rent to criminals, you\u2019re \u201cracist\u201d because this disproportionately affects African Americans.7 Once again, this book isn\u2019t about race, but it is about reverse racism. I\u2019m merely responding in self-defense. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Neighborhoods How many Americans realize that Obama\u2019s HUD agency is forcing cities and towns across America to build high- density, low-income housing in middle class and wealthy white neighborhoods? Why? A liberal Mexican American activist at a famous economic event called FreedomFest aimed a question at Donald Trump that explains what we\u2019re facing. Clearly angry at Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall at the Mexican border, he asked Trump, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to build a wall around your inner cities to protect your citizens from American criminals?\u201d The factual answer to that question is we already have. It\u2019s called \u201csuburbs.\u201d America has experienced a \u201cwhite (and every other racial group with the economic ability) flight\u201d away from inner cities to suburbs for decades. It\u2019s why Detroit lost over half its population. Decent, law-abiding people of all races with good jobs tend to run away from crime\u2014especially once they start a family. But to Obama and his liberal friends, this isn\u2019t \u201cfair.\u201d People don\u2019t have a right to be mobile, send their kids to better schools, or avoid crime. Obama wants everyone to live in shared equality (i.e., misery). Now he\u2019s found a way to accomplish that. If he can\u2019t find a way to force you to live in poor, crime-ridden, inner city neighborhoods, he\u2019ll just create them in your neighborhood! As a bonus, this policy erodes personal responsibility and capitalism by eliminating the necessity to study hard, work hard, or be disciplined to move from a poor neighbor- hood to a nice middle-class one. But wait, it gets better; it\u2019s part of a socialist\u2019s wish list. This policy not only creates fairness and equality by putting poor people into wealthy neighborhoods without working for it; it also destroys the property values of middle-class, pre- dominantly white homeowners. In the short run, the poor may be lifted up; in the longer run, everyone else is brought down. For liberals, that\u2019s \u201cequality.\u201d Look at it from the point of view of a middle-class American. You\u2019ve worked long and hard so your kids can live in a safe neighborhood, only to see Obama force low-income housing on your block, drive your home value down, and infest your nice, safe neighborhood with crime, muggings, robberies, carjackings, drugs, and prostitution. Nice! Again, while Obama and liberals keep wanting to make this a racial issue, it\u2019s not. Like whites, black middle-class Americans have followed the same route. For the most part, middle-class blacks have left the inner cities. They move to suburbs to escape crime, filth, drugs, and poverty and to give their kids a chance at success. But Obama wants there to be no escape. He\u2019s bringing the devil to you. To your neighborhood, your block, perhaps next door. He\u2019s putting drug dealers on your corner. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Health Care It is a fact that Obamacare\u2019s main purpose is to redistribute wealth. Small business owners (primarily white) and middle-class Americans (primarily white) have been devastated by massive increases in health care costs: insurance premiums, copays, deductibles, cost of prescription drugs, and loss of coverage. Who has gained? Poor Americans who were handed free insurance coverage. It has been a direct transfer of wealth disguised as a health care program. Poor and nonworking Americans were handed a massive new entitlement program: \u201cwelfare in the form of free medical.\u201d As with every government program, middle-class Americans (pre- dominantly white) got the bill. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Economy Obama has passed the most dramatic tax increases along with the most onerous business regulations in history. Who were they aimed at? Predominantly white small business owners and middle-class Americans. We know how he feels about business owners. Remember when he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Immigration Obama has left the borders wide open, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to pour into America, all of whom expect cradle-to-grave entitlements. Don\u2019t forget, Obama has also fast-tracked the importation of about one million Muslims into America during his two terms.8 Well over 90 percent of these new Muslim immigrants are on food stamps, while almost 70 percent are on welfare. These stats are according to Obama\u2019s own Labor Department.9 We are fed lie after lie after lie about illegal immigration by Obama, Hillary, government bureaucrats, and, of course, the mainstream media. We are told that illegals are not flowing across the border. In a presidential debate, Hillary claimed there is no border problem. Wrong. Record numbers of illegals are coming across in 2016. As I write this book, the number of illegal aliens crossing the border is at an all-time record pace: 40 percent higher than the record set in 2014 and double the number in 2015.10 More illegals cross the border into Texas than babies born to native-born mothers in Texas each week.11 We are told that illegals are not costing America any- thing. We are told they are a \u201cnet gain.\u201d What a big fat lie. Earlier in the book I proved that illegal immigrants cost hundreds of billions of dollars in welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and other entitlements\u2014far more than native-born Americans, both percentage-wise and dollar-wise. We\u2019re told it\u2019s not \u201ceither/or.\u201d We\u2019re told America can afford to take care of American citizens and illegal immigrants. Another big fat lie. Obama just cut $2.6 billion from veterans, while allocating $4.5 billion to the importation and relocation of Syrian migrants. So why would a US president choose to cut money from vets in favor of fast-tracking Syrian migrants into our country? Why is that more important than taking care of veterans?12 So I guess it is \u201ceither/or.\u201d Vets, who happen to be in the predominantly white middle class, are getting shafted to pay for Muslim immigration. Perhaps the hundreds of billions spent on all other illegal immigrants is the reason there were no funds for VA hospitals and courageous heroes were put on fictitious waiting lists to die. Those heroes happened to be predominantly white middle-class citizens. In Obama\u2019s last budget as president, he demands nearly $18,000 for every illegal child or teenager from Central America who enters the country in 2016 (he expects over 75,000).13 That\u2019s $3,000 more than the average American senior citizen collects on Social Security, even though they were legally born in America, worked their entire lives, and paid into the system. So native-born Americans are getting out monies they already put in, and still they get less than some- one who comes here illegally. Keep in mind that many (if not most) of these children and teens might very well collect welfare for life. What does that cost the middle class? If you can\u2019t see that this is a purposeful attack on the predominantly white middle class, you\u2019re blind, deaf, or very dumb. We are told that illegals aren\u2019t criminals. Another big fat lie. One out of every five illegals has a criminal record (not including the crime of coming into the country). Illegals committed almost half a million crimes in Texas alone, just in the past four years. Half a million crimes\u2014in one state.14 Multiply that number across the country and tell me the cost to society in police, courts, public defenders, prosecutors, and prison costs? What is the cost to the victims? How about the Americans murdered at the hands of illegals? That\u2019s a pretty damn steep cost. Here\u2019s the most remarkable stat of all: 30 percent of all criminals in federal, state, and local prisons in the United States are illegal immigrants.15 This isn\u2019t happening by mistake or coincidence. The Obama administration is currently arguing in front of the US Supreme Court that Obama has the power to use executive action to instantly award Social Security to millions of immigrants illegally in the United States.16 Now let\u2019s move on to legal immigrants. Obama is purposely importing immigrants legally into the country who fit the parameters of his plan to \u201cfundamentally change America.\u201d From 2009 to 2013, the Obama administration issued twice as many green cards to immigrants from Muslim nations as European nations\u2014680,000 green cards for Muslims versus 270,000 for Europeans.17 Why is Obama choosing this ratio? Because this is how you \u201cfundamentally change America,\u201d \u201coverwhelm the sys- tem,\u201d and destroy capitalism, replacing it with socialism for a citizenry dependent on government entitlements to survive. The bonus is bringing in unskilled, uneducated, and dependent immigrants who will forever more vote Democrat to keep the freebies coming. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Obama doesn\u2019t discriminate. Every immigrant who needs welfare is welcome: Muslim, Mexican, Central American. Cubans are in a special class. All they have to do is get over the border and they are immediately met with a so-called \u201cWelcome Wagon\u201d that gives them instant cash, Social Security cards, food stamps, and Medicaid.18 As the country, health care, and school systems are all overwhelmed by massive costs for illegal immigration, and the debt rises to unimaginable levels, who pays for it all? American taxpayers. And who are they? The small business owners and middle-class Americans who spend their lives paying into the system and take almost nothing out. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Why doesn\u2019t someone stand up and say it\u2019s time to stop flooding the country with even more poor and unskilled immigrants, legal and illegal, and spend those billions upon billions of tax dollars now being given to them to improve America\u2019s inner cities and the lives of American citizens? Oh, guess what? Someone has. His name is Donald Trump! The Silicon Valley Jobs Scam Middle-class Americans don\u2019t realize the immigration scam isn\u2019t just about working stiffs. The cannon is aimed squarely at college-educated white-collar Americans, too. It\u2019s called H-1B visas. This is precisely why college grads with massive student loan debt are living in all-time record numbers in their parents\u2019 basement. This is why the icons of Silicon Valley are freaking out about the possible election of Donald Trump. These greedy and guilty white billionaires want to keep importing hundreds of thousands of low-wage foreigners to fill their jobs, instead of higher-paid American workers.19 The sad truth about Silicon Valley is that they fear Trump because they don\u2019t want to pay real wages to American white-collar college grads. Guest worker programs have devastated the predominantly white middle and upper classes. We\u2019ve been replaced by desperate foreigners willing to work for slave wages to get to (and stay in) America. They can never ask for a raise for fear of losing their H-1B visa. You want to know why we are angry white males? The H-1B program has resulted in massive job losses and a decade of wage deflation. The media paints illegals as victims just looking for a better life for their families. Well, here we\u2019re talking about American white-collar young adults who played by all the rules, graduated from good colleges, studied high technology, amassed massive student debt, and are being victimized by cheap legal foreign labor. They played by the rules and got screwed. Who\u2019s the victim now? Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Education The public school system has been ruined by teachers\u2019 unions, common core, and bleeding-heart liberal ideology. The school system is so bad, especially in America\u2019s larger cities, that parents who have any hope for their children\u2019s success spend their last dime on private schools, parochial schools, or homeschooling. That means business owners and taxpayers like myself are forced to pay double taxation. I\u2019m paying obscene, unaffordable property taxes to pay for public schools that I can\u2019t send my own kids to. At the same time, I\u2019m forced to pay $15,000 to $20,000 per child for alternative education. So business owners and middle-class taxpayers who pay into the system (made up of predominantly white taxpayers) are bled dry to give their children a proper education, while we\u2019re also forced to pay for a terrible free education for the children of the poor, who pay no taxes and pay nothing into the system. Since they pay nothing for it, it is easy for the vested political and corrupt union interests to get them to vote for higher and higher education spending even with that system continually failing even their children. So is it any wonder the goal of liberals like Obama and Hillary is to keep poor people poor and let more and more poor and unskilled people into America, so that eventually their votes outnumber native-born, hardworking, employed Americans. Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Currency This is the most absurd example of all. Do you know what a president does when his policies have so badly damaged the economy, ruined health care, killed all decent middle- class jobs, destroyed GDP, and run up $9 trillion in new debt, resulting in black unemployment being double that of white and causing black violent crime to run wild in Democrat- ruled, black-dominated cities? Obama attempts to appease the masses of oblivious voters by changing the faces and images on the front and back of five-, ten-, and twenty-dollar bills to celebrate \u201csocial justice and diversity.\u201d It\u2019s called BREAD AND CIRCUS. And it\u2019s now clear that \u201cwe are Rome\u201d in the days just before the fall. Like Nero, Obama, his ignorant Kool-Aid-drinking socialist cabal, and the biased progressive media are fiddling while America burns. Obama has no clue how to turn around the economy or create jobs for black (or white) Americans, so he changes the faces on the currency to distract the masses. This is \u201cfeel-good,\u201d politically correct B.S. I\u2019m sorry, folks, but putting a heroic black woman like Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill (and she is an American hero) won\u2019t create a single job or raise the GDP above zero. Putting Martin Luther King on the back of the five-dollar bill won\u2019t help a stagnant economy. Just like everywhere else it\u2019s been tried, the reality is that Obama and his socialist cabal have proven an economy can- not be run based on diversity and social justice. Basing our currency on diversity and social justice won\u2019t help either. It\u2019s just BREAD AND CIRCUS to keep the masses from unrest and rioting. Keep in mind that Obama\u2019s treasurer, Jack Lew, ordered the mint to make the changes on currency a \u201cpriority.\u201d He also disclosed there was \u201cgreat pressure\u201d to showcase \u201cdiversity\u201d on our money. Really? From who? Who thinks in the middle of an Obama Great Depression the priority is putting images of civil rights leaders on our dollar, instead of making it a priority to create jobs and improve GDP? Insanity, ignorance, and reverse racism abounds. All of it is aimed at the predominantly white middle class. So much of what Obama and the liberals are doing, and the media is dutifully reporting, is simply a distraction, waste of resources, and pacifier so we won\u2019t notice how far worse things have gotten under Obama and his liberal policies. I\u2019ve saved perhaps the best for last. Don\u2019t Offend Criminals Not only is Obama demanding criminal backgrounds not be considered in hiring, but he no longer wants them to be called criminals. This is a new directive sent out to colleges by the Obama administration. The term \u201ccriminal\u201d might offend. Along with this directive came a pamphlet referring to convicted criminals as \u201cjustice-involved individuals.\u201d You can\u2019t make this up. Obama thinks a criminal is just someone \u201cinvolved with justice.\u201d We can\u2019t allow a rapist to be offended by calling him a rapist because names hurt! So now the per- son that raped your older daughter can go to work at your younger daughter\u2019s university without fear of being identified as or called a rapist. At worst, it might become known he is someone \u201cinvolved with justice.\u201d But then, in Obama\u2019s world, it wasn\u2019t their fault; a racist white society must have forced them to commit the crime. So from now on, just to be fair, no one should ever again be called racist. They are just \u201crace-involved individuals.\u201d Is this a purposeful attempt to hurt the predominantly white American middle class? You decide. But it sure looks like it. Allow Criminals and Violent Felons to Vote Willie Horton But I\u2019m a \u201clemons to lemonade\u201d kind of guy. I\u2019m a positive thinker. This is more than just a travesty of justice. This is more than just the ruination of America. This is opportunity knocking. This is a gift there for the taking. The Democrats have handed Donald Trump the perfect TV ad to win the 2016 Presidential election. Lee Atwater, the famous Republican advertising whiz who destroyed 1988 Democrat presidential candidate Michael Dukakis with the Willie Horton TV commercial, must be looking down from heaven with an ear to ear smile. Governor McAuliffe just handed the election to the Donald Trump and the GOP if this is handled correctly. This is Willie Horton, Part Deux. It\u2019s like shooting fish in a barrel. Find mugshots of the murderers who just got voting rights. Find mugshots of the rapists who just got voting rights. Mix in a few drug dealers and pimps. Then channel the great Lee Atwater. Get to work creating the most devastating TV commercials in modern political history. What a tragic monumental mistake Democrats just made. Not just any Democrat\u2014the best friend, ally, and chief fundraiser of the Clintons. I can see the TV ads now. Picture this: SCREEN IMAGE: Image of Virginia DEMOCRAT Governor Terry McAuliffe . . . ANNOUNCER: Hillary and Bill\u2019s best friend and chief fund- raiser just gave a gift to the Clintons. He just gave voting rights to scum . . . dirtbags . . . murderers . . . the worst of the worst criminals in Virginia\u2014so they can register Democrat and vote for Hillary. SCREEN IMAGE: Mugshots of the most heinous criminals, with crimes listed under their faces. ANNOUNCER: Think about that. They murdered people . . . they raped people . . . they carjacked people . . . they invaded homes and terrorized people . . . they sold drugs . . . they beat people almost to death . . . they pimped and beat young girls. Their victims will never again feel safe again. But the murderer, rapist, or thug who sold drugs to children is out on street\u2014and voting for Hillary. This is the length to which Democrats will go to win elections. But wait, there\u2019s more. Not only can they vote; they can serve on a jury, become a notary public, and run for office. SCREEN IMAGE: Mugshot of murderer . . . now with a \u201cVOTE FOR ME\u201d ribbon across bottom of screen. Someday your rapist may run for office. Someday your child\u2019s drug dealer may serve on a jury. Someday you\u2019ll need a notary public\u2014and your mother\u2019s murderer will be notarizing your signature. SCREEN IMAGE: Hillary at Congressional hearing saying, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d This is the depth of depravity of Hillary Clinton and her allies. Democrats\u2014the party of murderers, rapists, and drug dealers. Hillary is right at home. VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Folks, it really is this bad. Yes, we are angry. And we have every right and reason to be. Sadly, it\u2019s a full-scale attack coming from all directions and it\u2019s getting worse.",

            "article_content": "Researchers discover long-lost HMS Terror 168-years after Sir John Franklin's doomed ship wrecked The second of two British explorer ships that vanished in the Arctic nearly 170 years ago during a storied expedition to find the fabled Northwest Passage has been found. The Arctic Research Foundation said Monday that the HMS Terror has been located by a research ship. Last seen in the 1840s while under the command of Sir John Franklin, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror have long been among the most sought-after prizes in marine archaeology and the subject of songs, poems and novels. The wreck of the Erebus was found in 2014. \"Terror was found on Sept 3. It is a perfect time capsule,\" said Adrian Schimnowski, the expedition leader of the research ship that located the HMS Terror. The Terror was discovered in 26 yards of water in Terror Bay, a small indentation on the coast of King William Island west of the community of Gjoa Haven. It was located right where an Inuit hunter said it would be. Canadian Rear-Admiral John Newton said the two Franklin ships were found about 31 miles apart from each other. Franklin and 128 hand-picked officers and men had set out in 1845 to find the Northwest Passage, the long-sought shortcut to Asia that supposedly ran from the Atlantic to the Pacific by way of the harsh, ice-choked Arctic. The death of all 129 men made the Franklin expedition the worst tragedy in the history of Arctic exploration. Schimnowski said that mystery might have remained if not for a late-night conversation on one of the search vessels between himself and Sammy Kogvik, an Inuk and Canadian Ranger from Gjoa Haven. The two were on the bridge of the Martin Bergmann, a research vessel, and Kogvik was telling Schimnowski about the history of the shorelines they were sailing past. He started talking about something he had seen seven years ago while snowmobiling across the sea ice of Terror Bay. Kogvik recalled how he had looked behind him to check on his hunting partner when he spotted a large pole sticking up out of the ice. The two Inuit stopped and took pictures of what looked like a ship's mast. But when Kogvik got home to Gjoa Haven, he found he had dropped his camera and lost the shots. \"He kept the story secret because he didn't want people not to believe him,\" Schimnowski said. \"We listened to Sammy's story on the bridge of the Bergmann and changed course to take a look,\" he said. In a news release, Kogvik said he was delighted to see the vessel again. In the days since the discovery, the crew has identified a number of the Terror\u2019s features. There is video of the ship's bell. A cannon similar to those on the Erebus has been spotted. The ship's helm is still there \"in perfect condition,\" said Schimnowski. A windlass, used to haul up an anchor, still has heavy rope wrapped around it as if moored to the bottom of the sea. Newton called it an historic site for Canada and said there are no current plans to raise the two ships. John Geiger, president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, called the discovery of the HMS Terror the missing piece of the puzzle and historically significant for Americans given the role of the HMS Terror in the War of 1812. HMS Terror was one of the British naval bomb ships that took part in the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Battle of Baltimore in September 1814. The attack was the inspiration for the poem by Francis Scott Key that eventually became known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" \"Those bombs could have very well been lobbed from the Terror,\" he said. \"It's fundamental to the Star-Spangled Banner and the origins of the anthem of the United States. From a pure historical standpoint what an exciting find.\" The confirmation of the HMS Erebus find in 2014 was made by underwater archaeologists, following a meticulous review of data and artifacts observed from the Arctic Ocean's seabed and using high-resolution photography, high-definition video and multi-beam sonar measurements. Canada announced in 2008 that it would look for the ships, and the Canadian government has poured millions of dollars into the venture, with former Prime Minister Stephen Harper himself taking part in the search. It was all part of Harper's plan to boast Canadian nationalism and a sense of ownership of the north. Harper's government made the project a top priority as it looked to assert Canada's sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, where melting Arctic ice in recent years has unlocked the very shipping route Franklin was seeking. Canada says it owns the passage. The U.S. and others say it is international territory. The well-preserved wreck of HMS Erebus was found 12 yards below the surface, near King William Island, about 1,200 miles \u00a0northwest of Toronto. Historians believe that the ships got trapped in thick ice in 1846 off Prince William Island, and Franklin and some other crew members died in the ensuing months. The survivors apparently abandoned the two ships in April 1848 in a hopeless bid to reach safety overland. Inuit lore tells of \"white men who were starving\" as late as the winter of 1850 on the Royal Geographical Society Island near Prince William Island. For many years afterward, Franklin was celebrated as a Victorian-era hero. Dozens of searches by the British and Americans in the 1800s failed to locate the wrecks, and some of those expeditions also ended in tragedy. But they opened up parts of the Canadian Arctic to discovery and ultimately found a Northwest Passage, though it proved inhospitable to shipping because of ice and treacherous weather. The search for an Arctic passage to Asia frustrated explorers for centuries, beginning with John Cabot's voyage in 1497. The shortcut eluded other famous explorers, including Henry Hudson and Francis Drake. No sea crossing was successful until Roald Amundsen of Norway completed his trip in 1903-06. The exact location of Erebus was not disclosed for fear of looters. The research ship was part of a small flotilla organized by the Canadian government and its partners that sailed for the Arctic at the end of August to search for the HMS Terror.",

But he is plowing ahead tonight anyway. The president\u2019s strategy for unveiling his executive orders is getting much praise from supporters, particularly because it will \u201ccoincide with the Latin Grammy Awards on Univision, which will cut away to air the president\u2019s address, thus guaranteeing excellent ratings among the Spanish language audience.\u201d Obama also teased the speech in conjunction with one of his corporate backers, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, by using Zuckerberg\u2019s site and then celebrating each other\u2019s posts. It may sound more like a way to launch a new flavor of potato chips or a Nickleback single than a major shift in public policy. But by handpicking media partners who support the action, Obama can guarantee favorable coverage for target audiences and dial back some of the consequences with the nation as a whole. [Watch Fox: President Obama delivers an address on immigration at 8pm ET. Stay with Fox News for full coverage and analysis.] Same old song - After a relatively poor showing this fall among Latino voters in key races, Democrats are keen to show vigorous action on immigration. So, narrow-casting his remarks to the Latin Grammy audience and then heading to Nevada for a campaign rally Friday is a logical step. It\u2019s also exactly how Obama has dealt with prior problems: Give a speech and then hit the road to complain about \u201cWashington.\u201d And while Democrats surely hope for Republicans to catch impeachment fever or at least offer the chance to force a government shutdown, there is little reason to believe this gambit will work any better than his previous talk treks. Remember how Democrats tried to rally black voters ahead of the midterm vote with targeted, often incendiary, outreach through African-American media outlets and direct mail. This is the same approach on a larger, risker, scale. After all, word will certainly get out. \u201cIf President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress will act. We\u2019re considering a variety of options. But make no mistake. When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act.\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, in a Senate floor speech today. One mouth, two sides - The message the president would like the audience for the Latin Grammys to take away is that this is a big deal and that he is audacious and decisive. The message for the rest of the country is that this is no big deal, and just like what previous presidents of both parties have done to deal with a \u201cbroken\u201d immigration system. Despite lots of evidence to the contrary, there will be a strong effort by the president to downplay these actions as temporary, necessary and normal. But with the results of the Nov. 4 elections still fresh on Americans\u2019 minds, it will be hard for them to see this as anything but vindictive and obstinate behavior by a president who can\u2019t deal with his new political reality. [The Federalist\u2019s Gabriel Malor truth squads claims that Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration is comparable to those of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush: \u201cThey were trying to implement a complicated amnesty that Congress had already passed \u2026 Obama is clearly contravening both ordinary practice and the wishes of Congress\u2014as expressed in statute\u2014by declaring an amnesty himself.] What\u2019s in the plan, man? - The White House has not released the official details of President Obama\u2019s executive action, but there have been lots of breadcrumbs from the White House. Fox News first reported the contours of the plan to grant temporary amnesty to an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants. Since then, a steady flow of reports have offered clues to what Obama will declare: [Teepees - Buzzfeed got a glimpse at the White House\u2019s immigration talking points sent out to Democratic congressional offices.] Governors ready suits - NYT: \u201cGov.

            "article_content": "House Democrats protest inaction on gun violence WASHINGTON \u2013 Rebellious Democrats shut down the House's legislative work on Wednesday, staging a sit-in on the House floor and refusing to leave until they secured a vote on gun control measures before lawmakers' weeklong break. Exasperated Republicans were forced to recess while cutting off cameras that showed the protest. But in an unprecedented step, C-SPAN used live video feeds from one lawmaker's Periscope account and another's Facebook page to transmit words and images from the House chamber. More than 200 Democrats led by Georgia Rep. John Lewis demanded a vote on measures to expand background checks and block gun purchases by some suspected terrorists in the aftermath of last week's massacre in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people in a gay nightclub. \"No bill, no break,\" shouted Democrats, who demanded that Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., keep the House in session through its planned break next week to vote on gun legislation. Democrats accused Republicans of political cowardice by failing to schedule a vote. Proud to sit with @RepJoeCourtney and others demanding action. #GoodTrouble #NoBillNoBreak pic.twitter.com/SNMWlQ0ZfZ \"Are they more afraid than the children at Sandy Hook?\" asked Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., referring to the 2012 shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 elementary school children, in Newtown, Connecticut. \"What is so scary about having a vote?\" Lewis, a veteran civil rights leader, asked what Congress has done, then answered his own question: \"Nothing. We have turned a deaf ear to the blood of innocents. We are blind to a crisis. Where is our courage?\" Ryan dismissed the protest as \"nothing more than a publicity stunt,\" and in an interview with CNN, made clear there would be no vote. \"We're not going to take away a citizen's constitutional rights without due process,\" he said. Republicans emerging from a closed-door meeting said they would hold votes on other legislation, but not the gun votes demanded by the Democrats. \"We are going to go about our business starting tonight,\" said Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo. Democrats were certain to challenge any move. The protest began around 11:30 a.m., interrupted briefly when Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to start the House's work at noon. The customary prayer and Pledge of Allegiance went ahead, but Poe was forced to recess the House when dozens of Democrats refused to leave the well. By evening, more than nine hours later, 168 House Democrats \u2014 out of 188 \u2014 and 34 Senate Democrats joined the protest, according to the House minority leader's office. One after another, they spoke of the need for gun control and talked of constituents who had been killed. Scattered around the House floor were signs reading \"Disarm Hate.\" Visitors watched from the galleries. A crowd of several hundred gun control advocates gathered outside the Capitol and cheered as Democrats addressed them. Congress remains gridlocked over gun control, a divide even more pronounced in a presidential election year. The sit-in had the feel of a 1960s-style protest, as some lawmakers sat on the floor, others in their seats. Republicans had staged a similar protest in 2008. Democrats controlling the House at the time turned off the cameras amid a GOP push for a vote to expand oil and gas drilling. Republicans occupied the floor, delivering speeches after then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the House on its August recess. Pelosi ordered the cameras turned off. Republicans ultimately forced the drilling provision to be attached to a stopgap spending bill. C-SPAN, a cable and satellite network that provides continual coverage of House and Senate floor proceedings, does not control the cameras. They're run on authorization by legislative leaders. Although the cameras were turned off Wednesday, lawmakers relied on social media to transmit video, using Facebook, Twitter and Periscope. C-SPAN broadcast live video streamed on Periscope and Facebook from lawmakers' accounts. Democrats posted the Capitol's main telephone number, which was overwhelmed, and urged constituents to call and request a vote. They also encouraged tweeting under the hashtag #NoBillNoBreak. Democratic senators joining the protest included Minority Leader Harry Reid, Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who had waged a nearly 15-hour filibuster last week to force votes in the Senate on gun legislation. Those votes failed Monday night. Democrats cited polls showing broad public support for expanding background checks for firearms purchases and blocking suspected terrorists from buying guns. Pelosi, now the minority leader, said the House needs to act on gun legislation, rather than continually hold moments of silence in memory of victims of gun violence. \"We truly believe that if there were a vote that we would win the vote, because 85 to 90 percent of the American people ... support responsible background checks legislation,\" Pelosi said.",

            "article_content": "Political Insiders debate what impact this policy will have on Trump's campaign A pro-Trump, independent PAC has announced its first wave of online advertising in support of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 run for the White House. The Art of the Deal PAC\u2019s online ad started appearing on Drudge Report Monday and will run through Aug. 25, according to PAC founders Dan Gallegos and Andrew Vlahakis. The ad will specifically focus on illegal immigration, a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s campaign so far. The online ad says, \u201cIf fences don\u2019t work, why does Barack Obama use one?\" The image shows a close-up of the White House fence, with #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. \u201cThis image highlights the remarkable hypocrisy of the Obama Administration in refusing to approach border security seriously and build a wall. If President Obama is not confident in the efficacy of fences, why does one protect him at the White House?\u201d the PAC said in a statement. Gallegos and Vlahakis are both from the Chicago area. \u201cOver the last decade, we have become increasingly distraught with the direction of the country and the lack of any substantive changes in Washington regardless of who is elected. Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy excites us because he is serious about solving the challenges we face,\u201d the founders told Fox News. Both say this online ad will be the first of many. They hope to expand their footprint beyond Drudge in the coming months. Gallegos and Vlahakis started laying the ground work for their PAC in early July and filed their Statement of Organization with the FEC at the end of the month. They were officially recognized Aug. 7. The Art of the Deal PAC isn\u2019t the first pro-Trump group to organize. In July, the Make America Great Again PAC was launched. At the time, the group\u2019s legal counsel Jon Anderson said: \u201cAmerica requires proven and successful leaders who will return our country to excellence.\u00a0 Make America Great Again is supporting leaders who will answer that charge, including Donald Trump.\u201d",

The ruthless Vladimir Putin, like his predecessor Josef Stalin, may be a useful ally against an even greater evil, but a \u201chighly respected\u201d leader? Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. But Donald Trump\u2019s admiration for and defense of Putin isn\u2019t wacky or ill-informed. It is evidence of how American politics is becoming increasingly European in nature. Trump often sounds like European \u201cfar-right\u201d leaders with his focus restoring nationalistic vigor and the dangers of foreign migrants. But never more so than with his recent Putin praise. That\u2019s a longstanding trait of Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful far right parties. They admire Putin. He helps them disrupt the political order in their home countries. And that helps him gain the upper hand in his effort to make Russia the world\u2019s dominant power. That\u2019s not to say that the admiration isn\u2019t sincere. The European nationalists and Trump admire Putin\u2019s strength, his explicit targeting of Islamism and his championing of traditional values. And it is all made possible by the failure of the European system. And never has it looked so obviously failed as of late. Aside from decades of economic stagnation and bureaucratic paralysis, the European Union is now forcing unwilling citizens to accept the arrival of millions of Syrian refugees. \u201cFar right\u201d can be confusing for Americans. It\u2019s not in the traditional American understanding of the left/liberal-right/conservative political spectrum. The European right tends to be fiscally liberal and in favor of activist government. Its defining issues have been about national sovereignty and immigration, which are issues about which American conservatives care, but formerly, many liberals did too. The idea of the American system in which there is basically a government party and an anti-government party seems just as odd to Europeans as the idea of a big-government right is to most Americans. But this is what happens to failing systems. And the Republican/Democrat duopoly has failed for sure. A secure border and functioning internal immigration controls are popular with voters of both parties. But to satisfy open-borders hardliners and to maintain the issue as a way to drive deeper the wedge between Hispanics and Republicans, Democrats have refused to act. Even to enforce existing laws. Even in the era of metastasizing Islamist militancy. Republicans, meanwhile, know that if they were to help President Obama to pass the tax overhaul he has long sought, it would be a boon to the economy and help kick off a period of economic growth. GOP leaders say they don\u2019t trust Obama enough to make a deal, but the truth is that it\u2019s that their voters who don\u2019t trust them. Any Republican caught negotiating with Obama on anything of substance would face total rebellion. In this fashion, America is evolving something more like a parliamentary system in which policy advances only occur when one party has total control of both governing branches. The problem is made worse here by the fact that those moments are harder to come by in a system of divided government. And when the tumblers all align, as they did in 2008, parties jam and cram through all of the measures their most ardent constituencies demand. The result is gridlock occasional punctuated by ideological veering and lurching and an increasingly frustrated electorate. No segment \u2013 left, right or center \u2013 gets what it wants and people increasingly lose faith in the system and its institutions. And that\u2019s the time when politicians like Trump can find purchase. If the current dysfunction becomes the norm for America, Trump will be just the first of many, increasingly successful candidates of the European mold. GRAHAM OUTNYT: \u201cSenator Lindsey Graham suspended his presidential campaign on Monday, saying that he has concluded \u201cthis is not my time\u201d despite making a difference in the race. The South Carolina Republican made the comments in a YouTube video. \u2018Since launching my campaign for president on June 1, I have offered a path to saving the American dream and working together on bold solutions to solve big problems,\u2019 said Mr. Graham, one of the most hawkish foreign policy voices in the race who has nonetheless been stuck in the low single digits in polls.\u201d 2016 GOP POWER INDEX:\u00a0JEB AGAIN?It\u2019s bad to be without a clear path to the nomination. But, as a political saying goes, it can be \u201cliberating.\u201d Like his stablemate John Kasich, Jeb Bush is devoting himself almost exclusively to hammering away at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Hitting the guy at the top of the polls has always been a good way for back-of-the-pack candidates to get attention. While that\u2019s true this time, there\u2019s the added motivation that Bush and others believe that if Trump is toppled, the race will be wholly remade. The last shall be made first, etc. Bush is succeeding with the former. By talking about Trump, Trump, Trump, Bush has gotten a boost in coverage from a Trumpcentric political press. And, Bush has seemed relieved to finally be able to say that he thinks Trump is \u201ca jerk.\u201d But will this help Bush more or Trump more? Given the fact that so few are willing to tackle Trump head-on and that Power Index frontrunner Ted Cruz is Trump\u2019s ablest enabler, Bush has little choice but to weaponize his candidacy. But at the same time, Bush is one of the least popular figures in his party and has always made the best foil for Trump. In the long run, a Bush resurgence most likely helps Trump. But in the short term, Bush is playing the card he has left. And given the devastating efficiency in which Cruz and Rubio are slashing each other to ribbons right now, every other non-Trump has a bit more reason to hope that the front of the pack might crack open. 1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Donald Trump; 4)\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0[+1]; 5)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[-1]; 6) Chris Christie On the radar -\u00a0Ben Carson,\u00a0John Kasich,\u00a0Rand Paul and\u00a0Mike Huckabee[Watch Fox: Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0joins \u201cThe Real Story with\u00a0Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.] What would you say? -\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

History.com: \u201cThe movie also made a star out of Benjamin Braddock\u2019s graduation present: a bright-red Alfa Romeo Duetto Spider. Alfa Romeo had been making racecars for decades\u2026But the 1967 Duetto Spider, a two-seat convertible roadster, was a real beauty: It had a sharp nose and a rounded, tapered rear end, glass-covered headlights, and what designers called a \u2018classic scallop\u2019 running down the side. It handled well, could go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 10 seconds, and got 23 miles per gallon of gas. Though the Duetto Spider was a great car and a pop-culture icon, Americans still weren\u2019t interested in buying it. The model\u2014with new names like the Spider Veloce, the Quadrifoglio and even the Graduate\u2014stayed on the market until 1994, without much sales success.\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Even if she\u2019s not lucky enough to draw him in a head-to-head matchup, Clinton will work to make her opponent little more than Trump-lite. That\u2019s what Justin Barasky of the Clinton-backing powerhouse super PAC Priorities USA sees ahead once she\u2019s head to head with the Republican nominee, whoever it may be. In the latest edition of Power Play, Barasky tells Chris Stirewalt that Republicans are \u201cpainting themselves\u201d as Trump-like and the result will be terrifying to key groups of the Obama coalition that Clinton is looking to reconstitute and ride to the White House. WATCH HERE. Tale of the tape - David Drucker says Dems aren\u2019t scared of Trump and the data backs them up: \u201cIn the latest\u00a0Fox News poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, Clinton was losing to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, 45 percent to 43 percent, and was tied with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, at 45 percent each. But she beat Trump like a drum, 49 percent to 38 percent, and came close to the important 50 percent mark\u2026 \u201cClinton beat Trump among women by 26 points and only trailed him by 5 points among men. She beat him among voters with college degrees and without; she demolished him with black voters and was only 5 points behind in the battle for whites. Clinton trailed Trump by a single point among independents. But she picked up 15 percent of Republicans, holding Trump to just 72 percent among voters in his own party.\u201d Clinton campaign fudges Trump in ISIS videos claim - Yahoo: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s communications director defended her candidate\u2019s claim that ISIS is using videos of Donald Trump\u00a0to recruit members, but could not point to specific evidence of this happening\u2026 \u2018She\u2019s not referring to a specific video, but he is being used in social media by ISIS as propaganda,\u2019 [Jennifer Palmieri told ABC News.]\u201d Debate not all roses for Hillary - Fox New contributor Doug Schoen called Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate \u201cHillary\u2019s night\u201d but also pointed to Clinton\u2019s vulnerability on foreign policy: \u201cMartin O\u2019Malley] noted how Ambassador Chris Stevens was not provided the proper support and tools to help Libya transition into a thriving democracy \u2013 a clear reminder of his untimely death. No doubt this foreshadows what will be in all likelihood a major line of attack from the Republicans and stands to really hurt her going forward.\u201d Obama blames media for stoking ISIS fears - The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama said in an [NPR] interview broadcast early Monday that he understands why Americans are worried about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), adding that it is important \u2018to keep things in perspective.\u2019 Obama blamed the media in part, for fears, saying that in the past month, \u2018all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you.\u2019\u201d ALWAYS SIGNAL BEFORE EXECUTING YOUR TURNThe Telegraph: \u201cThe government in the Netherlands has clarified that it is legal for driving instructors to offer lessons in return for sex, as long as the students are over the age of 18. However, it is illegal to offer sex in return for lessons. Transport minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen and Justice minister Ard van der Steur addressed the issue in response to a question tabled in parliament by Gert-Jan Segers of the socially conservative Christian Union party, noting that, although 'undesirable', offering driving lessons with sex as payment is not illegal. In a letter to parliament the ministers said: \u2018It\u2019s not about offering sexual activities for remuneration, but offering a driving lesson. It is important that the initiative lies with the driving instructor, and focuses on offering a driving lesson, with the payment provided in sexual acts. When a sexual act offered in lieu of financial payment, that is prostitution.\u2019\u201d Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

Britain entered uncharted waters Friday after the country voted to leave the European Union, according to a projection by all main U.K. broadcasters. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) People (I will politely call them that, when referring to celebrities and media on Twitter) are acting like the Brexit vote is the end of humanity. It\u2019s an online spectacle, this manic hissy fit orchestrated by A, B and C listers who seemingly have ignored the scandalous depravity unfolding in Venezuela, the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the murderous homophobia of ISIS and assorted other Islamist terror outfits, \u00a0the barrel bombing of Syrians (which helped foster the Brexit vote). Yes, the Chicken Littles\u2019 pleading for a re-vote are the same ones who CAUSED the vote, through selective outrage, shallow taunts and cowardly ambivalence. Brexit could have been avoided if its critics could have been honest about the present day world. Brexit could have been avoided if its critics could have been honest about the present day world. But they weren\u2019t. And so, on that note, here\u2019s why Brexit happened, from a Yank\u2019s eye. The Remainders remained home; the silent ones didn\u2019t If you want to know who didn\u2019t go out and vote \u2013 it\u2019s the people hilariously demanding a second chance. The people who were sure Brexit wasn\u2019t going to happen, were so sure it wasn\u2019t going to happen, that they didn\u2019t bother to get off their arses and vote. Now they want a do-over, a redo, calling this election a mulligan. I don\u2019t think it works that way. If you didn\u2019t take it seriously the first time, and everyone else who voted did \u2013 that\u2019s on you. You were caught out in your arrogance and ignorance, assuming everyone who was for the exit was a frail, white angry pensioner. Turns out they were people you know \u2013 they just never told you so! While you ragged on and on about the bigotry of the leavers at a cocktail party in Chelsea or a pub in Islington, those who disagreed just silently nodded, hoping you\u2019d shut up at some point. The Remainders offended anyone who felt discomfort over mass migration. Fact is, Great Britain has been under siege by the Islamophobia-phobia \u2013 the same disease that also grips the American media and body politic. If you express any fears over the rise of Islamism and its assorted toxic doctrines (whose consequences are recently visible in horrific splendor), you are the bad guy \u2013 the racist. You are actually worse than the perpetrator of such misdeeds. The sense that control over your own country was now in the hands of impotent bureaucrats in Brussels, and that a vote to leave could wrest your country away from such toadies who are putting your country at risk \u2013 is not a symptom of racism or xenophobia. It\u2019s actually a sensible outlook given the state of affairs all over the globe. True , the mass migration is not the refugee\u2019s fault: the west shares blame in its ineffectual response. And many don\u2019t wish to flee \u2013 they simply have no choice. But given that over a million who might stream into Germany could then now come to Glasgow or Glastonbury \u2013and within these numbers might sneak a lone ISIS fiend \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t you, a British citizen, be concerned? You\u2019d be an ostrich with your head not just in the sand, but up your own butt. The modern human lacks sense of priority.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s hilarious or sad that Lindsay Lohan, James Corden and others are expressing outrage over Brexit, as Venezuela descends into an abysmal amalgam of Soylent Green and Lord of the Flies. Bold-faced names are expressing elitist outrage over a vote, while people down south are assaulting each other over toilet paper. Venezuela represents real-time suffering, not the hypothetical hysterias put forth over Brexit. The actual policies of \u00a0a government \u2013 one lauded by Sean Penn and Oliver Stone \u2013 are creating a living hell, against the wishes of the suffering people. And yet, the stars in our celebrity skies prefer to wring their soft, precious mitts over Brexit. Here\u2019s why: Venezuela\u2019s demise is caused by an ideology romanticized by the same people fretting over Brexit: socialism. It\u2019s just easier to call a British man who fought in World War II a racist, than it is to condemn an inhuman ideology that he fought and beat. Fact is \u2013 Venezuela would LOVE to have a referendum like Brexit \u2013 to be able to exercise some autonomy over and away from the tyrannical ideologues who\u2019ve destroyed their once rich country. Instead they starve and/or die, while the media denigrates grannies drinking tea. How did this lead to Brexit? I have a theory.\u00a0 Philosophers who are way smarter than me have studied this perplexing priority\u00a0 -- that despite leading moral lives we tend to care more about a small problem in our vicinity (my roof is leaking), than a larger problem far away (a mudslide kills hundreds). Even more, research shows that the larger the suffering, the less we react. Meaning our heartstrings will be pulled harder by the photo of one starving child \u2013 than many children equally in pain. It\u2019s weird but true. We care less when there is more. What we are seeing with Brexit is a play on this weird reflex.\u00a0 Because a starlet once lived in London, this compels her to express an oh-so-brave stance against Brexit (even though a week ago she might have thought Brexit was a laxative). Yet, has she said anything about Venezuela, or Syria, or Afghanistan, or the Taliban?\u00a0 I must have missed it. My point: it\u2019s no longer a comparison between one starving child and many, it\u2019s a choice between exercising one\u2019s moral superiority in a risk-free environment (let\u2019s go on Twitter and call pro-Brexit people racist or dumb) \u2013 and calling out real horror (islamists chucking gays off bridges and buildings). This moral cowardice as expressed by the most well-known of earthlings is what led to Brexit.\u00a0 Brexit wasn\u2019t just evidence of a natural concern over one\u2019s well being in the face of rising Islamism amidst the European Union\u2019s lax immigration policy, it\u2019s also a big middle finger (or two \u201cmiddle\u201d fingers, if you\u2019re British) to those who cannot prioritize injustice, or evil. So call those who voted for Brexit\u00a0 bigots or idiots -- you\u2019ll only encourage them. And by selectively ignoring greater evils around you -- you\u2019ll be making the case for leaving better than the leavers ever could.\u00a0 And you make the world less safe, too. Maybe it\u2019s good you stick to Twitter.",

            "article_content": "GOP senators claim the department is trying to register new voters in an effort to influence the presidential race; Adam Housley reports for 'Special Report' Critics say a combination of federal and local policies is being blamed for rolling out the red carpet for illegal immigrants, some of whom have committed violent crimes, allowing them to pour into a Long Island, N.Y., neighborhood where four teens have been murdered in recent weeks. Federal policy that allows Central American children apprehended by Border Patrol to be placed with illegal immigrant sponsors has sent thousands of teens to the region in recent years. While most don't arrive as hardened gang members, many are placed in homes with little supervision, say critics. Nisa Mickens, (l.), and Kayla Cuevas, (r.) \u201cIt should not be surprising that when these kids are allowed to enter illegally and then are placed in the custody of someone who is here illegally, they do not have much of an interest in complying with the process,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director for policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. Compounding matters for some communities on Long Island, which has been plagued with violent crimes from the notorious El Salvadoran gang MS-13, is Suffolk County's status as a sanctuary county. The Center for Immigration Studies reports that Sheriff Vincent DeMarco, who could not be reached for comment, refuses to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers without a warrant. Vaughan noted that illegal immigrants have a big incentive to sign up as sponsors of unaccompanied children, whether they are family or not: Doing so shields them from deportation. Sliwa says Suffolk County's sanctuary city status makes it a recruting pipeline for gangs. (Associated Press) Curtis Sliwa, founder of the community protection group the Guardian Angels, said Suffolk County being a sanctuary region only empowers MS-13. \"Sanctuary will have a great impact on safety in Suffolk County as long as gang bangers are allowed to prey on their own people,\" says Sliwa, referring to the MS-13 primarily targeting Central American migrants for gang membership. Known for patrolling subway platforms in New York City, Sliwa has now deployed Guardian Angels to bucolic communities on eastern Long Island, where violent crime at the hands of MS-13 is rising. Vaughan and others claim the situation is a recruiting pipeline for MS-13, and Suffolk County has seen a rise of the notorious and violent gang. Last month, Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, both 15, were brutally murdered. Days after the teens were found beaten to death, the skeletal remains of 19-year-old Oscar Acosta and 15-year-old Miguel Garcia-Moran were discovered, all allegedly linked, according to the Suffolk County Police Department, to this violent clique -- sparking community outrage. Vaughan has observed, through close analysis of immigration court records, that about half of the children are not showing up to their hearings. \u201cWhen they do, they typically are ordered to be deported, but under current policies, they are not a high priority to be tracked down for enforcement, unless they are convicted of a serious crime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s approach to dealing with the surge in illegal alien minors from Central America has been nothing short of a disaster for many communities.\u201d She said most of the children are not qualified for any kind of legal status here and are likely to be non-compliant with immigration regulations, especially when housed with an illegal immigrant. \u201cWhen that happens, they are usually ordered removed in absentia, but then ICE has to track them down, which isn\u2019t easy and requires a lot of resources,\u201d she says. Between 2013 and 2015, ICE had deported 5,834 people who entered the country as unaccompanied children, but by the time the feds catch up to them they are well into their adult years and have already committed a violent crime. Mark Weber, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the goal of the program is to place the children with their parents or family members who are already in the country -- regardless of their immigration status. \u201cLast year, 55 percent of children were released to a parent, 36 percent were released to a close family member and the remaining 9 percent were released to a distant or non-relative sponsor,\u201d says Weber. Weber says he does not have updated figures on how many children were placed with illegal immigrant sponsors, which includes home visits and follow-up calls once the child has been placed with the sponsor. However, the statistics posted on the HHS website tell part of the story. According to the HHS website, in fiscal year 2015 only 1,895 home visits were conducted out of 33,726 referrals made by DHS. Vaughan expressed little confidence in the follow-up phone call system, saying there is no way to monitor the progress of the child. Over the past four years alone, 225,725 unaccompanied Central American children have entered the United States -- with nearly 3,500 of them being placed in Suffolk County between October 2013 and July 2016. \"This influx has strained school systems in many places, and even worse, the lax oversight has enabled criminal gangs, especially MS-13, and trafficking organizations to bring in kids to boost their numbers,\" Vaughan says. \"The federal agencies and their contractors have failed in their responsibility to ensure the welfare of these kids; in fact, they admit that they have completely lost track of most of these teenagers.\" Sliwa expressed frustration with politicians who are obsessed with preventing ISIS attacks while gangs such as MS-13 wreak havoc around the nation and HHS continues the flood of Central American children in communities that are not prepared for the fallout. \"All you hear is crickets from both sides of the aisle,\" says Sliwa. \"Politicians don't get gangs.\"",

            "article_content": "FILE - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in New York, Tuesday, May 31, 2016. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) When it comes to comprehending America\u2019s system of justice, Donald Trump seems uninformed. His attack against a federal judge presiding over two civil fraud cases against the now-defunct Trump University proves it.\u00a0 He insists that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born in Indiana, is unfit to hear the cases because he is of Mexican ancestry.\u00a0 And, after all, the presumptive presidential nominee has vowed to build a wall along the southern border. Neither law nor facts support Trump The heritage or ethnicity of a judge is not, by itself, a conflict of interest recognized by the law.\u00a0 It never has been.\u00a0 Nor is race, religion, gender or anything related to personal identity.\u00a0 For Trump to say so reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of our court system.\u00a0 And for someone like Trump who has spent so much time litigating in courtrooms across America, it is astonishing. There is no evidence Judge Curiel has rendered any decision influenced by his own heritage or by Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexicans or constructing a wall. \u00a0Trump saying so\u2026 doesn\u2019t make it so. Yet, Trump claims he has been treated unfairly because the judge ruled against him on several pre-trial motions.\u00a0 As a chronic litigant, Trump might want to read the U.S. Supreme Court decision in U.S. vs. Grinell Corp. (384 U.S. 563, 1966) in which the high court ruled that losing motions is not evidence of judicial bias. If you read Judge Curiel\u2019s pre-trial decisions in the Trump University cases, they are all judicially sound, well-reasoned and legally justified.\u00a0 There is no evidence Trump is being \u201ctreated unfairly\u201d, as he claims.\u00a0 Trump lost those motions because neither the law nor the facts were on his side.\u00a0 In other words, he lost fair and square. Trump\u2019s lone defender Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales seems to stand alone as Trump\u2019s defender.\u00a0 He argues that Trump can ask Judge Curiel to recuse himself based on the appearance of impropriety.\u00a0 Huh? Since when is looking like something a legitimate basis for anything in the law?\u00a0 It is not.\u00a0 In courtrooms, we require evidence and proof.\u00a0 Especially when accusations are leveled against judges. Of course, Trump\u2019s lawyers are free to ask the judge to recuse himself. \u00a0But given their client\u2019s vitriol, have you wondered why Trump\u2019s attorneys have chosen not to?\u00a0 The reason is simple.\u00a0 They have read the federal law on judicial disqualification which provides the following specific grounds for recusal: ? Personal bias ? Personal knowledge of the evidence ? Was as a lawyer or adviser to the case ? Has a financial interest in the outcome ? Has a relative connected to the case (Source: 28 U.S.C. 455) The first ground, \u201cpersonal bias\u201d, is the relevant one. \u00a0The law requires that it be proved or reasonably demonstrated, not merely alleged.\u00a0 And it does not arise merely because of a judge\u2019s heritage.\u00a0 The U.S. Court of Appeals 2nd Circuit made that point abundantly clear in the case of MacDraw v. CIT Financial (157 F.3rd 956, 2d Cir. 1998): \u201cIt is intolerable for a litigant, without any factual basis, to suggest that a judge cannot be impartial because of his or her race and political background.\u201d So, Alberto Gonzales is wrong.\u00a0 If Trump were to follow his advice, he could be sanctioned, as the litigants were in the above-referenced case when they accused the judge of bias without any reasonable basis for making such an argument. Twisted logic When caught in an untenable argument, Trump often doubles-down instead of backing off.\u00a0 That is what he did this past weekend, when he said he doubted that a Muslim judge could remain neutral. Let\u2019s extend Trump\u2019s logic to other scenarios.\u00a0 Does this mean a Jewish judge cannot handle cases involving Jews?\u00a0 Black judges cannot preside over affirmative action or racial discrimination cases?\u00a0 Female judges cannot sit on the bench during a trial involving abortion or women\u2019s issues?\u00a0 Maybe white judges should recuse themselves whenever any of the litigants are white.\u00a0 Or black.\u00a0 Or whatever.\u00a0 In Trump\u2019s universe, there would be no judges left. Given some of his comments on the campaign trail, maybe that is what he has in mind.",

            "article_content": "September 14, 2016: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in central London, Britain. (Reuters) When Britain voted to leave the E.U. in June -- by a comfortable margin and with a record turnout -- it may have seemed the fight was won. Yet political elites who believe they, not the people, are sovereign are gearing up for one more siege to deny the British independence. New Prime Minister Theresa May, although a \"Remainer,\" has shown promising commitment by making her motto: \u201cBrexit means Brexit.\u201d Others in British and European political establishments have not followed her example. The Daily Telegraph reported Friday that top E.U. officials meeting at a summit in Bratislava are planning to make life hell for Britain during negotiations, in the hope that a wobbly British political elite will simply give up and remain in the E.U. Relations are already so toxic that Brexit Secretary David Davis recently called one of the E.U. negotiators \u201cSatan.\u201d The pressure is on in Britain too. Just as political elites across Europe have frogmarched voters back into the voting booths before when the vote doesn\u2019t go their way, the familiar call is now being rattled out by left-wing politicians, the BBC, The Guardian and on social media -- the British must vote again, or the referendum should be ignored altogether. Pro-E.U. demagogues at home and abroad have gone through an embarrassing litany of excuses of why the vote \u201cdoesn\u2019t count\u201d: the voters were conned, they didn\u2019t know what they were voting for, the voters were too old, the sample size was too small, and don\u2019t forget: \u201cRACIST, RACIST, RACIST!\u201d The argument\u00a0settled on -- perhaps the most brazen in its disregard for the voter -- is that the referendum was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and therefore either the voters or parliament should vote again. This time, they claim, the vote should be on when to trigger an obscure mechanism (Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty) to formally begin the process to leave the E.U. The idea that the referendum, which dominated the national and international news for months and costs millions of pounds, was merely a practice run for the real thing, or was simply a glorified poll for parliament\u2019s general amusement, is of course total tripe. The vote was advisory only because it was assumed that our politicians would abide by fair play and didn\u2019t need to be forced to do what a clear majority of voters want. It is also contemptuous of democracy. Labour MP David Lammy recently grumped that parliament is sovereign. No, Mr. Lammy -- the people are sovereign, and parliament is sovereign only in that it represents the people. And the people have spoken directly, they should not have to repeat themselves in order to be heard. Lammy is not the only one who wants to repeat elections over and over again until he gets what he wants, as if Britain were some third-world tin-pot dictatorship. Tony Blair has said Britain could still stay in the E.U., while wannabe Labour leader Owen Smith said if he were prime minister, his party would work to shut down Brexit. \u201cWe still think you should think again\u201d he scolded the British people on a radio show. Thankfully May has shown a hard head so far and reportedly intends to trigger Article 50 without consulting parliament, despite the howls of the left-wing commentariat. This is unsurprising considering the poll numbers, which show her Conservative Party (Tories) screaming ahead of Labour by 14 points -- a surge that can be put down to the Tories\u2019 honorable stance to stand by the vote. Yet the pressure is on. There is no clear Brexit party -- even a majority of Tories backed Remain -- and so the situation remains precarious if the vote were to go to parliament. Additionally, the bureaucratic jihadists of the E.U. will use every piece of legislative trickery to try and force Britain out of its unacceptable and uncouth desire for independence. Regrettably, even major politicians from America -- a land known for valuing independence -- are against Brexit. Obama\u2019s famous comment ahead of the vote that Britain would be \u201cat the back of the queue\u201d infuriated Brits to the point many believed it helped the Brexit cause. Last month, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton took the unusual step of calling out Nigel Farage -- the retired leader of the U.K. Independence Party -- as part of a \u201cglobal brand of extreme nationalism\u201d led by Vladimir Putin. She also accused Farage of \u201cstoking anti-immigrant sentiment to win the referendum.\u201d The implication was clear -- not only is Farage a racist, but so are those who voted with him. As Britain\u2019s economy glows despite the predictions of doom, those committed to the European behemoth are becoming more desperate, and the attacks are likely to only get more sinister and more hysterical. It remains to be seen if Britain can hold fast. Yet Britain has a good record for resisting such pressure. Britain was told it had to join the Euro -- it didn\u2019t. It was told it had to distance itself from the \u201csenile\u201d Ronald Reagan -- it didn\u2019t. It was told it should give up the Falkland Islands to the Argentinian brownshirts -- it didn\u2019t. It was told it couldn\u2019t possibly hope to resist the Nazi onslaught -- it did. I wish, dear reader, I could assure you Brexit will happen no matter what. I can offer no such assurance -- the battle for Brexit will be tough, bloody and long. Brexit hangs in the balance, but the signs are encouraging. Here is to hoping the Churchillian spirit of \u201cwe shall never surrender\u201d continues to guide Britain\u2019s leaders as they face the challenge of a generation.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton discuss Clinton's handling of classified emails, lowering health care costs and the fate of ObamaCare It\u2019s a strange time to be in St. Louis. For the first time since 2010, the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs. The St. Louis Rams are no more, having returned to their Los Angeles past. Maybe strangest of all: the political Shocktoberfest that is the 2016 presidential election, culminating in the second debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the city\u2019s Washington University. Between Friday\u2019s release of the 2005 video laced with Trump vulgarities and the WikiLeaks data dump of Clinton campaign emails and the candidate\u2019s Wall Street speech excerpts, this debate didn\u2019t lack for build-up. To say nothing of morbid curiosity: a pre-debate survey of Washington University students came up with this summation: \u201ca gruesome debate about who is more an enabler of sexual assault.\u201d Sure enough, a question about the video was brought up, right out of the chute, by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Trump admitted embarrassment, but quickly dismissed it as \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d Cooper pushed him on the subject \u2013 was he a groper, did he force himself on women? \u2013 but Trump wouldn\u2019t play along. Clinton, however, did. She questioned Trump\u2019s fitness for the job, then branched out from the video to past Trump comments about immigrants, African-Americans, POW\u2019s and those with disabilities. \u201cThe question our county must answer is this is not who we are.\u201d The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn\u2019t make the trip west. And then it got even more personal. Trump referenced the four women in the audience \u2013 Paula Jones, Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willey \u2013 who\u2019ve accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Did Clinton defend her husband? Actually, she invoked Michelle Obama: \u201cwhen they go low, you go high.\u201d Make of that what you will. Then she belittled Trump for failing to make past apologies, after which Trump upped the ante by promising to sic a special prosecutor against Clinton if he\u2019s elected. Mercifully, after 30 minutes of such rancor, the Average Joes (in the audience and on Facebook) got their turn. The highlights: An American Muslim woman asked Trump about what to do about Islamophobia on the rise. Trump called for the Muslim community to work more closely with law enforcement. Clinton went into a broader talk about defeating ISIS. That segued into one of Clinton\u2019s weaker moments: defending her plan to expand the Syrian refugee population from 10,000 to 65,000. Clinton invoked a bloodied boy, but couldn\u2019t resist trying to bloody Trump as a recruiting tool for ISIS and chumming the waters yet again over his Iraq war position. (Later, both candidates stumbled through the question of what to do about Aleppo \u2013 Trump sounded na\u00efve; Clinton put herself in a box by ruling out ground forces). Then came the question of the WikiLeaks passage in which Clinton supposedly said a politician sometimes needs \u201ca public and a private position\u201d on certain topics. Hillary tried to make it sound Lincolnesque. Equating Wall Street reform in a paid with the fight to abolish slavery? Sounds like a stretch. The closest anyone got to a question on the economy and tax reform? This query directed at Trump: \u201cwhat specific provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\u201d Two complaints about this debate: The overlap between audience and Facebook question led to a lot of talk about Syria and precious little about the country\u2019s tense mood. Race, the Supreme Court, guns and abortion all were pureed into one serving at the 86-minute mark. And the moderators: CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz were more aggressive in policing Trump\u2019s time and parsing his words (Raddatz, in particular, on Aleppo). Must there always be a question of a fair fight? A funny thing about this race: reports of Trump\u2019s political death may be exaggerated. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted immediately after the controversial audio was released gave Clinton a 42%-38% lead over Trump in a four-way race. Previously, it was 41%-39% in her favor. Something else the poll revealed: only 12% of Republicans think Trump should quit the race; 74% think the GOP establishment should continue to back him. The quandary this presents for Republicans: their nominee is wounded, he struggles to crack the 40% barrier; for down-ticket candidates, shunning the nominee risks alienating the GOP base. I give this debate to Trump. He was in better form than the first encounter in Hofstra. This time around, he wasn\u2019t as clunky when defending his record. Unlike the first debate, when he started strong but fell apart, Trump improved as the night went on. Add to that his decision to bring along the Bill Clinton accusers \u2013 the equivalent of Hillary dropping Alicia Machado on Trump at the end of the previous debate \u2013 and Trump had good night in terms of strategy and surpassing expectations. Clinton\u2019s style and presentation were better than Trump\u2019s \u2013 she seemed visibly more comfortable cradling the mike and approaching the audience. But I\u2019m subtracting points from Clinton for this reason: she could have spent more time on the high road, given Trump\u2019s recent travails, but too often she needlessly threw an elbow. In all, it was an evening that will be hard to forget. Trump thinks Clinton should go to jail. Judging by the look on her face, Clinton would like to condemn Trump to a more subterranean existence \u2013 which is funny, since it\u2019s Trump who thinks Hillary is satanic. And here you thought Hell was that debate stage.",

            "article_content": "NORFOLK, Va. \u2013 Khizr Khan, a Muslim-American whose son was killed in Iraq, held back tears Wednesday as he again took on Donald Trump, saying the Republican presidential nominee is peddling hate and no less than the \"future of the earth\" is at stake in the Nov. 8 election. \"There comes a time in an ordinary citizen's life where you have to gather all the courage you have and you stand up and speak against tyranny and speak against un-American hate,\" Khan said in a reference to Trump's stance on immigration, which has ranged from a complete ban on foreign Muslim immigrants entering the United States to \"extreme\" vetting and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from countries and regions plagued by extremism. \"This hate,\" Khan said at the Masjid William Salaam mosque, \"is un-American.\" Trump fired back with a familiar refrain, telling ABC News that Khan's son, who died in Iraq trying to protect his unit from a suicide bomber, would still be alive had Trump been president in 2004 instead of Republican George W. Bush. \"I wouldn't have been in Iraq,\" Trump said, once again falsely insisting he was opposed to the Iraq War before it started. \"Had I been president, Capt. Khan would be alive today.\" Fumed Khan, \"This is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents.\" Khan first gained national attention from the podium of the Democratic National Convention when he paid homage to his son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in Iraq in 2004. Khan held up his pocket-sized Constitution and said Trump has sacrificed \"nothing.\" The elder Khan's Norfolk visit comes after a new Hillary Clinton campaign ad that features him tearfully discussing his son's death. The campaign said last week that it would air the ad in seven battleground states. Trump won most of the southeastern cities and counties along the James River in Virginia's March 1 Republican primary. And a survey of the nation's service members conducted last month by the Military Times and Syracuse University showed Trump slightly leading Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, 37.6 percent to 36.5 percent. Clinton had 16.3 percent of their support. Trina Phillips, chair of Military Spouses for Trump, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that her candidate has widespread support. \"I think the Khans have come out and used their Muslim background as a weapon to make him seem more prejudiced against them,\" said Phillips, 46, who lives in nearby Newport News with her husband, an air traffic controller in the Air Force. \"They're also using the death of their child as a weapon,\" she said. \"And that's not very fair.\" But Khayriyyah Azeez, 63, a retired nurse from Norfolk, said she sees support for Clinton. Her son, Kasib Azeez, is a Navy sailor who prayed with Khan at the mosque after Wednesday's speech. \"It's easy to fall for some of the stuff Trump says,\" Azeez said. \"But when I speak to my son, most of the young people (in the military) are voting for Hillary.\" Speaking to the AP after his speech, Khan said the mosque was an appropriate place to stump for Clinton. \"Somehow it has gotten into our minds that places of worship should not be included in your political conversation. Not at all,\" he said. \"This election is a crossroad election for the future of this country.\"",

For instance, it once would have been unimaginable that a sitting president of the United States would have spoken as harshly and explicitly about a candidate as President Obama did of Donald Trump on Tuesday. That Obama did it from the White House and in the company of a foreign leader makes it all the more astonishing. Standing beside the Singaporean prime minister at a press conference, Obama declared Trump \u201cunfit to serve as president\u201d and lacking \u201cthe judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.\u201d In another year, it would have been seen as beneath the dignity of the office for a president to engage this way. Presidents are supposed to say that they will leave it to the voters, defer to the nominee of their party and not get into the back and forth, yadda, yadda yadda\u2026 But in 2016, it\u2019s sort of \u201cwhatevs.\u201d Part of this is the fraying of institutions and the coarsening of the culture. But most of it is Trump himself, who is already proving to be a catalytic historical figure. If his campaign is really teetering on the brink of collapse and Republicans are near open revolt, as is being reported elsewhere, then Trump would be, in fact, a historical one-off. But that\u2019s not what seems to really be happening here. Yes, Trump is trailing in the polls, but his core support seems to be holding, keeping him consistently above the 40 percent mark \u2013 about the same the GOP nominee held the week after the conventions in 2012. Trump had a respectable fundraising haul in July and can be expected to bring in plenty of money in the form of small-dollar donations from his army of supporters. In short, the political system is appalled by Trump, but the voting public, for now at least, is treating him like an ordinary Republican politician. And there\u2019s no reason to believe, based on external signs, that Trump is going anywhere. Contrary to what many in the press and public life want to believe, this is really happening. And Trump really is going to leave a lasting mark on American politics and culture. Trump delights in smashing every convention. He attacks his own party with glee, refusing to endorse its leaders in their re-election bids. He\u2019s been in a days-long bitter battle with the parents of a war hero killed in Iraq. He won\u2019t release his tax returns. He engages in the rawest, most personal political conflict we have seen in modern times. He does whatever he wants and he doesn\u2019t care what the rules say. Obama was looking to call Trump out for his conduct. We watched rival Republicans try to do the same thing in primary battles with Trump and each time it didn\u2019t work. Rather than being shamed, Trump was empowered and the other guy ended up abasing himself. Now, that\u2019s not to say that it will work as well in the general election. Hardly. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich summed it up in an interview on Fox Business Network this morning, discussing what he said was Trump\u2019s \u201cvery self-destructive behavior\u201d: \u201cTrump is still behaving as though it was the primaries and there were 17 candidates. He has not made the transition to being the potential president of the United States, which is a much tougher league.\u201d True dat. But even if Trump doesn\u2019t win the election, he has already remade his party. Watching the agony of GOP members contorting themselves in the pitiful Terpsichore of the simultaneous denunciation/endorsement would be sad if it were happening to people other than politicians. That was Obama\u2019s point Tuesday when he called out the Republican leadership and urged its members to repudiate Trump: \u201cThe alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump.\u201d Obama is right, at least in the sense that Republicans have substantially lost their party and its traditional posture. That\u2019s over now. This is a new party that will live or die based on the way the story of Trump ends. The history books leave no room for asterisks next to nominees\u2019 names. What Obama seems not to grasp is that Trump is changing the rest of politics, too. The president apparently believed he could sacrifice a little more of the dignity and remove of the White House podium in order to shame voters into rejecting Trump. Most of Trump\u2019s voters certainly don\u2019t care, and there\u2019s little reason to believe this kind of tut-tutting does much good in the broader electorate. Obama was looking to use his office to rise above the moment and be an authoritative voice. But rather than rising above the fray, Obama is climbing into the wrestling ring with Trump.TIME OUT: PUNCTUATION WON\u2019T BRBThe Conversation: \u201cThough periods can still signal the end of a sentence in a text message, many users will omit them (especially if the message is only one sentence long).

Inspired by his Syrian immigrant father, Alacha plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in modern Middle Eastern studies. He goes to Oxford in 2016, where he plans to widen his studies to examine whether Western notions of human rights are compatible with Islamic law. (May Barakat via AP) (The Associated Press) BOSTON \u2013 The honor of winning a Rhodes scholarship carries extra weight for Neil Alacha. It will help connect him to his Middle Eastern roots. A senior at Harvard University, Alacha was among 32 U.S. students announced Saturday as winners of one of academia's most prestigious awards, which will send them to England's University of Oxford. He plans to pursue a master's degree in modern Middle Eastern studies, inspired by his father, a Syrian immigrant. During his childhood, Alacha grew up in the same Brooklyn neighborhood as his mother. He played in the same park she had. Her family's old home was across the street. But his father's early life was largely a mystery to Alacha, a gap he credits with sparking his curiosity about the Middle East. \"I've never been to Syria. I have no idea what the sights and sounds of my dad's childhood were,\" said Alacha, 21. \"I had a lot of questions.\" After graduating at the top of his class from the elite Brooklyn Technical High School, Alacha headed to Harvard and began exploring his heritage. He took Arabic language classes and spent two summers studying in Jordan, one of the few Middle Eastern countries U.S. colleges deem safe for student travel. At Oxford, he plans to examine whether Western notions of human rights are compatible with Islamic law. He's now writing his senior thesis at Harvard on human rights and the Syrian refugee crisis, and he spent last summer talking with Jordanian officials about balancing the interests of local communities with those of refugees. It's a personal topic for Alacha and his family. His father grew up in Damascus, Alacha said, and still has two brothers who live there. His father, Michael Alacha, came to the U.S. in 1978 to get a college degree. He eventually found work as an engineer and became a U.S. citizen. His mother's family comes from a mix of European countries. As a child, Alacha said, he met relatives from both sides who spoke languages he had never heard. \"I saw that we're all driven by the same basic emotions,\" he said. \"There's something that bridges us together past our national divide.\" Those who know Alacha praised his ability to analyze issues from a wide range of standpoints, even if they differ with his own. \"What is particularly good about his creativity is that it's supported by a tremendous intellect,\" said Eric Malczewski, his academic adviser and a lecturer on social studies at Harvard. \"He is a student who not only grasps the ideas, but he makes something new out of them.\" Friends have called Alacha warm and genial. He's a roller-coaster fanatic who, in his spare time, has helped Harvard employees master English as a second language. But he has a competitive streak, too. In eighth grade, Alacha won a New York City spelling bee. Last school year, he led the first Harvard mock trial team to win a national title. He is president of Harvard's model congress, which runs government simulations for high school students around the world. Still, on Saturday, after an interview at a ritzy New York club before a panel of esteemed academics, Alacha was overwhelmed to learn he had won the Rhodes scholarship. He was among 2,000 students across the country who had asked their colleges to nominate them for the coveted award. Afterward, he and his parents celebrated over a nostalgic dinner at Sancho's Restaurant in Brooklyn, one of his longtime favorites. Next year, he leaves for Oxford and a chance to study some of the biggest problems in the Middle East. \"I doubt that in a two-year master's I'll have any sort of answer,\" he said, \"but the most important thing is that I and others are able to understand different perspectives.\"",

            "article_content": "CHICAGO \u2013 The Latest on the appointments by Pope Francis of his first U.S. cardinals. (all times local): 3 p.m. Chicago's Roman Catholic archbishop says he learned in a 5 a.m. call from Rome that Pope Francis was elevating him from archbishop to cardinal. Blase Cupich joked with reporters after Mass Sunday at Chicago's Holy Name Cathedral that he didn't mind being awakened given the pleasant news. But he says he usually sleeps until 7 a.m. on Sundays and that he'd miss the two extra hours of sleep he normally gets. Cupich was one of 17 new cardinals named Sunday by Pope Francis. Cupich said he was humbled by the honor. Another reporter asked Cupich how his relatives would react to word he's becoming a cardinal. He laughed and said he expected them to treat him \"with the same lack of deference that they have in the past.\" __ 10:45 a.m. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is congratulating Roman Catholic Archbishop Blase Cupich on his elevation to cardinal. Cupich was one of 17 new cardinals named Sunday by Pope Francis, among them Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell, the outgoing bishop of Dallas. The three men are moderates who follow Francis' emphasis on mercy over rules. Speaking at the end of a special Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, Francis said the 17 would be elevated at a consistory on Nov. 19, on the eve of the close to his Holy Year of Mercy. In a statement, Emanuel said in his short time in Chicago, Cupich has made a tremendous impact as a voice for the voiceless in the name of inclusion. Emanuel went on thank Pope Francis for recognizing Cupich's leadership in both the church and society. __ 10:05 a.m. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett says he is pleased the city's Roman Catholic archbishop has been elevated to cardinal. Pope Francis on Sunday named 17 new cardinals, including Archbishop Joseph Tobin. In his statement, Hogsett said Indianapolis has been blessed by Tobin's spiritual and civic leadership. He added he looks forward to working with Tobin and the Catholic Church to end poverty and inequality in the city. Speaking at the end of a special Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, Francis said the 17 would be elevated on Nov. 19. The elevation of Tobin is significant both for the U.S. church and the U.S. election and reflects Francis' concern for refugees. Tobin openly opposed the position of Indiana Gov. Michael Pence, now the Republican running mate of presidential candidate Donald Trump, against the settling of Syrian refugees in the state. __ 9:13 a.m. Roman Catholic Archbishop Blase Cupich says his elevation to cardinal of Chicago's archdiocese is both humbling and encouraging. Pope Francis named 17 new cardinals Sunday, including Cupich and Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin. In a statement, Cupich said when he was appointed archbishop two years ago, he committed wholeheartedly to serve the people of Chicago. Cupich says the role of cardinal brings new responsibilities, but he will continue to work on renewing the church and \"preparing it to thrive in the decades ahead.\" Cupich is considered a pastor in Francis' likeness, emphasizing the merciful and welcoming side of the church. His nomination as Chicago archbishop was Francis' first major U.S. appointment and he was a papal appointee at the pope's family synod last year. __ 8:11 a.m. Pope Francis looked to the American Midwest when picking his first U.S. cardinals. The Vatican announced Sunday that Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich and Archbishop Joseph Tobin of Indianapolis, Indiana, will become cardinals in a Rome ceremony Nov. 19. Francis also picked Bishop Kevin Farrell for the honor. Farrell has led the Diocese of Dallas, but is leaving for a prominent Vatican post. The three men are moderates who follow Francis' emphasis on mercy over rules. Tobin drew national attention this year for rejecting a request from Indiana Gov. Mike Pence for the church to stop settling Syrian refugees in the state. Pence is the Republican nominee for vice president and running mate of Donald Trump, who has proposed deporting illegal immigrants and banning entry of Muslims from other countries.",

            "article_content": "Man arrested four times in two years The federal government can tell you how many \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders\" stole a car, the precise number of \"American Indian or Alaska Natives\" who were arrested for vagrancy or how many whites were busted for counterfeiting in any given year. But the government agencies that crunch crime numbers are utterly unable -- or unwilling -- to pinpoint for the public how many illegal immigrants are arrested within U.S. borders each year. In the absence of comprehensive data, FoxNews.com examined a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics that revealed a wildly disproportionate number of murderers, rapists and drug dealers are crossing into the U.S. amid the wave of hard-working families seeking a better life. The explosive figures show illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their 3.5-percent share of the U.S. population would suggest. Critics say it is no accident that local, state and federal governments go to great lengths to keep the data under wraps. \"There are a lot of reasons states don\u2019t make this information readily available, and there is no clearinghouse of data at high levels,\" said former Department of Justice attorney J. Christian Adams, who has conducted exhaustive research on the subject. \"These numbers would expose how serious the problem is and make the government look bad.\u201d \u201cThey should have been sent back to their home country instead of being allowed to stay here and have the opportunity to kill Americans.\u201d Adams called illegal immigrant crime a \"wave of staggering proportions.\" He and other experts noted that the issue has been dragged into the spotlight by a spate of cases in which illegal immigrants with criminal records killed people after being released from custody because of incoherent procedures and a lack of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement officials. The murders, including the July 1 killing of Kathryn Steinle, allegedly by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco, have left grieving loved ones angry and confused, local and federal officials pointing fingers at one another and the voting public demanding secure borders and swift deportation of non-citizen criminals. San Francisco shooting suspect Francisco Sanchez and victim Kathryn Steinle are shown in this composite photo. (Associated Press) \u201cEvery one [of the recent cases] was preventable through better border security and enforcing immigration laws,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cThey should have been sent back to their home country instead of being allowed to stay here and have the opportunity to kill Americans.\u201d A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement told FoxNews.com that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrant crime are not available from the federal government, and suggested contacting county, state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally, a process that would encompass thousands of local departments. FoxNews.com did review reports from immigration reform groups and various government agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Sentencing Commission, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Government Accountability Office, the Bureau of Justice Statistics and several state and county correctional departments. Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants. Critics say better border security is needed to keep illegal immigrants out, but those caught committing crimes here must be imprisoned and deported. (AP) (Reuters) There are approximately 2.1 million legal or illegal immigrants with criminal convictions living free or behind bars in the U.S., according to ICE's Secure Communities office. Each year, about 900,000 legal and illegal immigrants are arrested, and 700,000 are released from jail, prison, or probation. ICE estimates that there are more than 1.2 million criminal aliens at large in the U.S. In the most recent figures available, a Government Accountability Office report titled, \"Criminal Alien Statistics,\" found there were 55,000 illegal immigrants in federal prison and 296,000 in state and local lockups in 2011. Experts agree those figures have almost certainly risen, although executive orders from the Obama administration may have changed the status of thousands who previously would have been counted as illegal immigrants. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals are being deported. In 2014, ICE removed 315,943 criminal illegal immigrants nationwide, 85 percent of whom had previously been convicted of a criminal offense. But that same year, ICE released onto U.S. streets another 30,558 criminal illegal immigrants with a combined 79,059 criminal convictions including 86 homicides, 186 kidnappings, and thousands of sexual assaults, domestic violence assaults and DUIs, Vaughan said. As of August, ICE had already released at least 10,246 criminal aliens. David Inserra, a policy analyst for Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at The Heritage Foundation, said letting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes go free while they await deportation hearings is putting the public at risk. \u201cWhile it is not certain how many of these individuals were here illegally, most of these individuals were in deportation proceedings and should have been detained or at least more closely supervised and monitored until their deportation order was finalized and executed,\u201d Inserra said. Adams opened a rare window into the dearth of public data when he obtained an internal report compiled by the Texas Department of Public Safety and revealed its contents on his Pajamas Media blog. The report showed that between 2008 and 2014, noncitizens in Texas -- a group that includes illegal and legal immigrants -- committed 611,234 crimes, including nearly 3,000 homicides. Adams told FoxNews.com that other states have also closely tracked illegal immigrant crime, especially in the wake of 9/11, but said the statistical sorting \u201cis done behind closed doors.\u201d States closely guard the statistics out of either fear of reprisals from the federal government or out of their leaders' own insistence on downplaying the burden of illegal immigrant crime, he said. \"There are a lot of reasons states don\u2019t make this information readily available and there is no clearinghouse of data at high levels,\" Adams said. \"These numbers would expose how serious the problem is and make the government look bad.\" Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, (l.), and Jose Fernando Villagomez, (r.), allegedly broke into the home of Marilyn Pharis on July 24. (Santa Maria Police Department) A smattering of statistics can be teased out of data made public in other states heavily impacted by illegal immigration, although a full picture or apples-to-apples comparison remains elusive. \u25a0 In Florida, there were 5,061 illegal immigrant inmates in state prison facilities as of June 30, but neither the state Department of Corrections nor the Florida Department of Law Enforcement track the number in county prisons, spokesmen for those agencies told FoxNews.com. \u25a0 In Illinois, where state prisons house 46,993 inmates, some 3,755 are illegal immigrants, according to Illinois Department of Corrections figures. Once again, state officials do not compile figures for county jails, although a Cook County official estimated that nearly 6 percent were illegal immigrants. \u25a0 In Arizona, neither state public safety officials nor the governor\u2019s office could produce figures showing the number of criminal illegal immigrants held in county jails, but state prison figures released by the Arizona Department of Corrections show out of 42,758 prisoners held in state facilities in July, about 10.8 percent were illegal immigrants. \u25a0 In California, there were 128,543 inmates in custody as of Aug. 12, but the state, which has been criticized for its leniency toward illegal immigrants, no longer keeps track of the citizenship status of inmates. As of July 31, 2013, the last time figures were documented, there were as many as 18,000 \u201cforeign-born\u201d citizens in California state prisons of 133,000 incarcerated. The Board of State and Community Corrections provided figures to Fox News from 2014, showing there were 142,000 inmates in 120 county prisons, but while everything from mental health cases to dental and medical appointments are closely tracked, the number of illegal aliens -- or even non citizens -- is not. \u201cFrankly, this is something every state should track, but they don\u2019t. Not even ICE publishes this much information on offenders and immigration status,\u201d Vaughan said. Several pro-immigration groups contacted by FoxNews.com declined to comment on the outsize role illegal immigrants play in the U.S. criminal justice system. One group that did insisted that even illegal immigrants provide a net benefit to the U.S. \u201cImmigrants, regardless of their legal status, make valuable contributions to our economy as workers, business owners, taxpayers and consumers,\u201d said Erin Oshiro, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. \u201cWe need an immigration system that that keeps families together, protects workers, and prioritizes due process and human rights.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee blasts 'stupid' U.S. leadership, refugee and immigration policies on 'Fox & Friends' Every week, Fox News contributor Karl Rove wraps up the last week in politics and offers an inside look at the week ahead. Events Continue to Intrude:\u00a0 Pressure cooker bombs in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, pipe bombs in northern New Jersey, and a knife wielding Somalia-American in Minnesota are powerful evidence the U.S. faces a rising threat of global Islamic terrorism. What does this mean politically? When terrorism intrudes more heavily into the campaign, it tends to help Donald Trump, who calls the threat by its name and promises tough action.\u00a0 Even before police confirmed that it was a bomb in New York and not an accident, Trump declared it was a bomb.\u00a0 He later tweeted, \u201cUnder the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook! ... Saturday's attacks show that failed Obama/Hillary Clinton polices [sic] won't keep us safe!\u201d Hillary Clinton may now be recognizing the political impact of terrorism on the campaign since she, too, issued a tough statement saying, \u201cI strongly condemn the apparent terrorist attacks\u201d and pledging \u201cwe will not rest\u201d until \u201cwe bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\u00a0 She called for the defeat of \u201cISIS and other terrorist groups\u201d and referred to her \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to do that, reminding Americans they \u201chave faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger.\u201d But Clinton later made a mistake by disputing Trump\u2019s claim that terror attacks in the U.S. are on a rise.\u00a0 Ordinary Americans are right to think the country is more at risk for Islamic-inspired and often directed attacks.\u00a0 This is another reason that when the issue is terrorism, many swing voters are inclined to think the answer is Trump. After a Few Good Weeks, Trump Falls Off The Wagon:\u00a0 When the Washington Post\u2019s Bob Costa asked Trump Wednesday if he thought President Obama was born in the United States, Trump answered, \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet.\u201d\u00a0 He also waved off a statement by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, that Trump now accepts that Obama was U.S. born, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s allowed to speak what she thinks.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s re-involvement in the birther movement put him squarely in the fever swamps, taking the short end of an issue where 80 percent of the American people think he\u2019s wrong. Trump tried to close Friday by saying \u201cPresident Obama was born in the United States, period.\u201d\u00a0 But he and his campaign then claimed the birther issue was first raised by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign with Conway pointing to a statement by Clinton\u2019s former manager that a volunteer in Iowa was spreading the issue eight years ago.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a big difference between the candidate and her campaign raising the issue and a volunteer doing it.\u00a0 Team Trump should avoid putting themselves in a place where every Trump supporter\u2019s actions and words could be laid at the feet of the candidate. Also on Friday, Trump discarded his script and extemporized at a Miami rally, suggesting Clinton\u2019s Secret Service detail should have their guns taken away and \u201cthen we will see what happens.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s never good for a candidate to sound like he expects violence. With the debate a week away and the election only 50 days off, Trump must remember the voters he needs are not like his hard core base, who might respond to red meat like that (though even many of them may winch, too).\u00a0 Swing voters desperately want change but worry Trump is too risky.\u00a0 His rhetorical flourish that she should have to face the campaign trail with unarmed Secret Service agents heightens the concerns of the voters Trump needs to win. Race Tightens More: In the last week, the RealClearPolitics average has tightened from 45.9% Clinton, 43.1 Trump last Monday \u2013 a 2.8% margin for Clinton \u2013 to 44.9 Clinton to 44% Trump, a 0.9% margin, this Monday. \u00a0The movement largely occurred because of events the week before last, when Clinton was under fire over her emails, special favors for Clinton Foundation donors, and keeping her diagnosis of pneumonia from the public. The race is probably a little wider than a point since the RealClearPolitics average includes the LA Times/USC Tracking Internet poll which has suspect methodology and gave Trump a seven-point lead.\u00a0 Even so, Trump has wiped out more than 80 percent of the lead Clinton enjoyed in early August. In the RealClearPolitics average of state polls, Trump now leads in Florida by 1%, Ohio by 1.2%, and Iowa by 4.3%.\u00a0 In late May, Trump was surprised when told he had a shot at Iowa.\u00a0 He\u2019s also ahead in Maine\u2019s Second District by 5.4% (Maine and Nebraska award Electoral votes by congressional district). In addition, Trump trails in North Carolina by only 0.8% and in Nevada by 0.7%.\u00a0\u00a0 The former was carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, the latter by Obama. But\u2026: Trump still has a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.\u00a0 If he carries North Carolina and the rest of the Romney states PLUS Florida, Ohio and Iowa, he\u2019s at 259 Electoral votes.\u00a0 If he takes Nevada, he\u2019s at 265. But then he must win Pennsylvania or Michigan or Virginia, which would give him 285, 282 or 278 respectively.\u00a0 Today, the RealClearPolitics average has him behind in the Keystone State by 6.6%, in Michigan by 5.2%, and in Virginia by 3.5%.\u00a0 While these margins are smaller than they were at this time last month, the race has not closed as much in these three battlegrounds as it has nationally. If he loses all three states, then his last option might be to win the four Electoral votes of New Hampshire (where he trails by 5%) plus the one Electoral vote from Maine\u2019s Second District.\u00a0 The would move him from 265 to 270, unless Clinton snakes away the Electoral vote from Nebraska\u2019s Second District that President Obama won in 2012.\u00a0 If that happened, then it would be Clinton 271 to Trump 269. Imagine \u2013 the presidential election could come down to how the residents of Bangor, Maine and Omaha, Nebraska vote.\u00a0 What a year.",

(AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) (The Associated Press) In this April 14, 2016 photo, activist and Soft Landing founder Mary Poole plays with her dog at home in Missoula, Mont. Haunted by the 2015 photo of a Syrian refugee boy washed ashore in Turkey, she and members of her book group asked: Why not bring a small number of Syrian families to Missoula? \"It wasn't even a grain of sand in my brain that people wouldn't want to help starving, drowning families. I didn't do this to be controversial. I didn't do this to stir the pot,\" she says. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) (The Associated Press) MISSOULA, Mont. \u2013 For the world, the photograph of a Syrian 3-year-old in a red T-shirt and black sneakers, his lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach, was a horrific symbol of the desperation of hundreds of thousands of refugees. For Mary Poole, a young mother haunted by \"those little shoes ... the little face,\" it was an inspiration. She and members of her book club asked: Why not bring a small number of Syrian families to Missoula? She knows now that this was a \"romantic\" notion. \"It wasn't even a grain of sand in my brain that people wouldn't want to help starving, drowning families. I didn't do this to be controversial. I didn't do this to stir the pot.\" But it did. And what started as a disagreement over whether to welcome dozens of refugees to this peaceful corner of western Montana soon erupted into something much larger, encompassing wildly divergent views of Islam, big government and whether Americans should \"take care of our own\" before worrying about newcomers. Neighboring counties \u2014 and in some cases, neighbors \u2014 locked horns. Demonstrators took to the streets: \"No Jobs, No Housing, No Free Anything,\" proclaimed some opponents' signs. Some warned that Islamic State terrorists could infiltrate their communities; others suggested that the federal government, long accused of tyranny in its dealings with the West, was at it again. The refugees' supporters did not back off. \"Rise Above Fear, Refugees Welcome\" they declared. Missoula's mayor, John Engen, was among them. \"I think that the war on terror has produced an internal war on compassion,\" he says. \"We have been programmed to be very afraid since 9/11 and to think of people who aren't white Anglo-Saxon Americans as 'other' and we should be afraid of people who are 'other.'\" This did not occur in a vacuum. What's happened here reflects what's happening across the nation in an election year dominated by inflammatory rhetoric over immigration, including calls for building a border wall, the mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the U.S. And more generally, Montanans are like other Americans who ask: How are we to live together, as one nation, when we are so estranged? At a time when the public is polarized over issues ranging from gay marriage to guns, the Rev. Joseph Carver, pastor at St. Francis Xavier Parish, sees this as just another \"incarnation of the larger divide in the country.\" His congregation, which gathers in a towering 124-year-old brick structure with frescoes, ornate scroll work, is overwhelmingly in favor of refugees. Carver, like others here, believes the spark that ignited this conflict is fear. \"Refugees,\" he declares, \"are seen as a threat to our way of life.\" Montana is a place of great beauty, with its snow-capped mountains, Ponderosa pines, bighorn sheep, bison and elk. Fly fishermen reel in trout from shimmering streams. College kids can be spotted kayaking on the Clark Fork River on cool spring nights. And a bookstore owner can point to the park down the street where a moose is known to frequent. It is not, however, a diverse place. Though the sparsely populated state is home to seven Indian reservations, nearly nine of 10 residents are white, according to Census figures. Only about 2 percent are foreign-born. Since 2012, the state has welcomed just 13 refugees from Cuba and Iraq, according to officials. But Missoula, site of a World War II detention center for Japanese-Americans, Italian merchant seamen and others, has a recent history of embracing refugees. The International Rescue Committee resettled the Hmong in the late 1970s and through the 1980s; some remain as farmers. Later, another agency brought Ukrainians and Belarusians here. With its coffee houses, murals and bike trails, Missoula has a laid-back feel. It is home to the University of Montana, as well as a peace center named for Jeannette Rankin, a pacifist who was the first woman member of Congress \u2014 and the only vote against declaring war on Japan after the Pearl Harbor attack. The center's philosophy is captured on a wall lined with bumper stickers \u2014 \"Peace is Patriotic,\" ''Books Not Bombs\" and \"Practice Nonviolence\" \u2014 and a stenciled message on a front window: \"Refugees Welcome.\" When Poole, a jewelry maker, and others formed a group called Soft Landing, they quickly expanded their plan to include not just Syrians but all refugees and turned to the International Rescue Committee to lead the resettlement. Their efforts were endorsed by the mayor, most council members and the three Democratic county commissioners, who sent letters to federal officials. But Missoula is an island of progressive blue surrounded by a sea of conservative red, and often diverges politically from other communities in Montana. Just to the south, in rural and Republican Ravalli County, a county commissioners' hearing over the issue was moved to a middle school gym to accommodate the hundreds who showed up for what turned into a raucous meeting. Several pro-refugee speakers were jeered .The commissioners formalized their opposition in their own letter to federal officials \u2014 and Flathead County, nearly 130 miles north of Missoula, did the same weeks later. In testimony and letters in Ravalli County, those saying \"no\" outlined their objections. They argued that Muslims or others from the Middle East could create the kind of chaos seen in Europe, impose an enormous tax burden and wouldn't be able to assimilate because they don't share American values. Many said their biggest fear was the U.S. government couldn't conduct adequate screening. Some spoke of apocalyptic visions of terrorists posing as refugees making their way to the quiet countryside. \"There's no 800 number you can call into Morocco or Libya or any one of those places ... and say, 'Can you check the identity of this person?' Without the ability to properly vet them, it's literally putting Americans' lives at risk,\" says Eli Anselmi, who felt compelled to write a letter even though he lives three hours away in Bozeman. The risk may be minimal, he says, but the potential harm is great. \"Let's say that you have a bowl of M&Ms ... and there are two that have cyanide. Will you eat from that bowl?\" Ray Hawk, a Ravalli County commissioner, has similar worries. \"These are folks that have declared war on the United States,\" he says. \"Their war is terrorism and that's the way they're going to do it. And I don't feel that we need to give them that chance. Now, if the government gets a handle on this thing and has a way to vet these people, I'm all for them. I love to see anybody come into America and succeed.\" Supporters of the refugees weighed in with reminders of America's tradition of providing sanctuary to those who've fled war and oppression; some cited their own family history. They spoke of empathy, pointed to a lengthy screening process and noted the other refugees who resettled here successfully in recent decades. Shawn Wathen, a bookstore owner in Ravalli County, was appalled his 18-year-old son was booed when he testified in support of the refugees and then later cursed by some opponents. Wathen wrote the commissioners, accusing them of \"xenophobic grandstanding.\" One replied that he was \"ignorant.\" Wathen, who has called the sprawling Bitterroot Valley home for 20 years, sees the rejection of refugees as a blend of misinformation, economic anxiety and fear of the unknown. \"It surpasses any notion of reason ... that kind of idea that they are not us, and therefore they pose a threat,\" he says. \"There's just that sense the horde is out there and if we don't circle the wagons ... we're going to be overrun and poor white America is going to suffer.\" America has a long history of wariness of refugees. Last November, shortly after the Paris terrorist attacks, a Gallup poll found that Americans, by 60 to 37 percent, opposed taking in refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. In 1978, there was a 57 to 32 percent opposition to accepting Indochinese boat people, and in 1946, after World War II, the public was against welcoming displaced people from Europe, including Jews, by 72 to 16 percent. Generally, Americans tend to favor refugees with whom they share some connection \u2014 political, religious or personal \u2014 and the public has little interaction with Muslims, says David Haines, a professor emeritus at George Mason University who has written extensively about refugees. He says the public doesn't understand the rigorous vetting process. \"The risks from refugees are really low because it's an extremely well-screened population,\" he says. \"But it's hard for people to settle down on this issue, especially in a highly politicized context.\" In Missoula, academics and religious leaders have expressed alarm about the harsh tone of the presidential campaign, especially comments aimed at Muslims by Donald Trump. In April, they sponsored \"Celebrate Islam Week\" at the university in hopes of countering the trend. Among the participants was Samir Bitar, an Arabic studies professor who arrived at the University of Montana in the 1970s as a 16-year-old freshman, raised a family and has spent most of his adult life here. Bitar has lectured for decades across the state without controversy \u2014 until this year, when about a dozen people in the nearby town of Darby objected to his planned talk at the library. The reason: They didn't want a Muslim in their town, according to the librarian. The library board voted. Bitar spoke and received a warm reception. But the tone and atmosphere are decidedly different now, he says. \"This is the first time I actually look behind me as I walk. I've been here 42 years,\" he says. \"It's like every part of my identity is coming under attack, including my American identity.\" Recently, two students accepted Bitar's challenge to walk around wearing Muslim head gear to see how people would react. One young man donned a kufi, or skull cap, and classmates wouldn't sit next to him, Bitar says. While working at a deli, the student was rebuffed by a customer's wife who said: \"'We're not going to have a Muslim help us.'\" Bitar, who is Palestinian, finds it all disheartening. People now are \"motivated by pure emotion and not really thinking in logical terms,\" he says. \"Fear turns into hatred.\" Jameel Chaudhry, the campus architect, a native of Kenya and another member of the small Muslim community, says he, too, senses a new hostility. \"All of a sudden WE are the problem,\" he says. \"We've never had this before, and I've been here 20 years. We didn't have this even after 9/11.\" Chaudhry attributes this attitude to Trump, accusing the presumptive Republican nominee of stoking fears for political gain. \"He's become the champion of the anti-Muslim, anti-refugee movement,\" he says. While that group talks of being tired of political correctness, Chaudhry sees something else: \"They don't want the other races coming in here.\" But those who've publicly spoken out against refugees bristle at suggestions they're racist. They say they're trying to protect their communities. \"It doesn't make any difference if they're Muslims, Russians, whatever. You have to know who they are, what they've been doing in the past,\" says Jim Buterbaugh, a construction worker who organized three opposition rallies, including one at the state Capitol. \"Are you going to go downtown and take five people off the streets and move them into your house without knowing who they are? Nobody in their right mind would do that.\" He and others are upset they have no vote on this issue. State and local governments legally don't have authority to bar refugees, though they can refuse to directly provide local services, according to Haines. Last fall, more than half the nation's governors declared their opposition to accepting Syrian refugees, saying a pause was needed until security concerns are addressed. That sense of being shut out of decision-making reflects a wider distrust of the government in parts of the West, where federal policies involving land, water and endangered species often clash with energy, timber and grazing interests. Though the refugee debate is different, it exposes the same raw nerves among opponents, who also question the economic and social impact. In a letter to her commissioners, Ravalli County resident Birte Nellessen said, \"to fool ourselves that we are helping 'poor folks driven out of their homeland by war' is ridiculous. They openly and blazingly state that they are coming to destroy us and our culture. ... Why we would spend any of our hard earned money on people like that?\" Nellessen, who moved to the U.S. from Germany 20 years ago, says officials should instead support local folks in need and that a smarter course would be to send supplies or money to help refugees rebuild in their homeland. \"I mean, what's a Syrian or Kenyan going to do in winter in Montana? Seriously.\" The answer is coming. The International Rescue Committee has met with Missoula's mayor, police chief and others to prepare for the refugees \u2014 about 100 will come over a year's time. The agency plans to reopen a resettlement office here this fall, after a 25-year absence. Those most likely to be relocated include Congolese, Afghans and Syrians who will have no family ties, so they'll have to live within a 50-mile radius of the office. Mary Poole is looking forward to their arrival. About 750 people have signed up to help refugees make the transition, she says. One former Missoula resident now living in Mongolia wants to get involved when she returns. Poole is already thinking ahead, too, about how this could change the life of her 17-month-old son, Jack. She envisions a day, she says, when he \"will be able to sit in a school next to someone of a different color, of a different language, of a different culture \u2014 and be able to learn that he lives in a global world. ... I don't think we can be insulated anymore.\" Poole knows resistance remains, and still meets with those who don't want refugees here. She says she's even made friends with some vocal opponents, recently inviting them to her house for a barbecue. \"We're asking for compassion,\" she says, \"and must be able to give that ourselves.\" And there's always a chance to win some over. \"They are us,' she says of the opponents. \"They are part of our community, and in order for this to be as successful as it possibly can be, it's about being in it together.\" ___ Sharon Cohen, a Chicago-based national writer, can be reached at scohen@ap.org",

            "article_content": "Fireworks at Hofstra University After years of campaigning for the nominations of their political parties, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the right to debate each other at Hofstra University Monday night in the first presidential debate of 2016. The Clinton campaign spent the last several days pushing the mainstream media, including debate moderator NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, to fact-check their view of the facts.\u00a0 The push from the political media was intense, and Lester Holt didn\u2019t disappoint the left.\u00a0 Holt failed to ask a single question about corruption allegations against the Clinton Foundation The more than 90 minute back and forth conversation between Trump and Clinton successfully highlighted the differences between the two candidates.\u00a0 Here are my top 16 debate moments that defined the night: 1. Hillary Clinton\u2019s answer to a question about how she planned to create jobs. -- It was all about what the government can and will do if she becomes president.\u00a0 Mrs. Clinton has no private sector experience to build on. Her answers reflected her experience. 2. When Trump slammed Clinton by saying \u201cyou\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. Why haven\u2019t you been able to implement any of these ideas?\u201d 3. When Hillary Clinton embraced her husband\u2019s economic policies by saying, \u201cMy husband did a pretty good job\u201d; to which Trump responded by saying \u201cHe signed NAFTA. And it\u2019s been a disaster.\u201d 4. When Trump turned a question about releasing his taxes into a challenge to Clinton. The Republican said he will release his taxes, against his lawyers\u2019 wishes, IF Clinton releases the 33,000 emails she deleted. 5. When Trump hit Clinton hard for the simple apology she always gives for using a secret personal server and avoiding government transparency laws. (Hint: \"It was a mistake.\") He said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was on purpose.\u201d 6. After Clinton responded to a question on the unfolding violence in Charlotte, N.C., Trump jumped in to say \u201cSecretary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to use a few words -- like law and order.\u201d 7. When Clinton made a long and passionate statement against the policing policy of stop and frisk. 8. When Clinton claimed the U.S. criminal justice system has \u201csystemic racism\u201d in it. 9. When Trump reminded viewers that Clinton created the term \u201csuper predator\u201d for young black men. 10. When Clinton gave a long answer on what she would do to ensure that foreign governments don\u2019t get access to private servers in the U.S. (and then failed to mention that she didn\u2019t do it for her own private server \u2013 which was hacked). 11. When Trump pushed back on Clinton\u2019s claim that Russia has hacked the DNC. \u201cIt may be Russia, it may also be China or someone else. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d 12. When Trump slammed Clinton on her record: \u201cYou were Secretary of State when ISIS was small, now they are huge.\u201d 13. When Hillary defended the Iran deal. 14. When Clinton said emphatically that she didn\u2019t say that the TPP trade deal was the \u201cGold Standard.\u201d (Which she did say and the fact checkers proved she said it immediately after she denied it.) 15. When Trump said dramatically: \u201cShe [Hillary] has experience, but it is bad experience\u201d 16. When Trump said he will support Clinton if she wins; Clinton merely said she \u201csupports our democracy\u201d but failed to specifically say she will support Trump if he wins. In the end, Trump easily proved that Hillary Clinton\u2019s multi-million dollar advertising campaign to define him as a two-headed monster was not accurate.\u00a0 Trump was tough, but fair; gracious, but firm.\u00a0 Clinton was prepared but robotic. After Monday night\u2019s debate, Team Hillary will need to go back to the drawing board to find a strategy that will stop Trump\u2019s current momentum. The estimated 100 million people who watched the two candidates face off against each other now know that Hillary\u2019s caricature of Trump was wrong. -- She was a classic politician forced to defend the status quo and he was the outsider articulating a need for change. With forty-one days left before Americans go to the polls, Clinton is running out of time to push a coherent message as to why the Democrats deserve a third term.",

            "article_content": "President blames Republicans for failing to fill open seat on the bench Since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, there have been issues where the court splits evenly. That\u2019s exactly what happened Thursday when the high court tied 4-4 in the case of whether President Obama\u2019s Executive action on immigration was unconstitutional and unlawful. The 4-4 tie upholds a lower court injunction, which blocked enforcement of the president\u2019s plan. That means a victory for the separation of powers and a sound blow to President Obama\u2019s lawless power-grab. While the tie vote does not establish any national precedent and applies specifically to this single case out of Texas, it should send a powerful message to this president: impatient presidents don\u2019t get to change the law. There is no written opinion when there is a 4-4 tie \u2013 just a one-sentence per curiam order. So, we did not hear specifically from the Justices themselves on this issue. But we did hear from President Obama, who sharply criticized the court for failing to issue a decision on the merits of the case. \u201cThe fact the Supreme Court wasn\u2019t able to issue a decision today doesn\u2019t just set the system back even further, it takes us further back from the country we want to be,\u201d the president said. He\u2019s wrong. What takes us \u201cfurther back from the country we want to be\u201d is a president who has relied on his infamous \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen and I\u2019ve got a phone\u201d mantra to circumvent the separation of powers spelled out clearly in our Constitution. At the same time, President Obama used the immigration case to predictably blame Republicans for failing to confirm his nominee to replace Justice Scalia. First of all, Congress is correct in waiting until after the election to fill Justice Scalia\u2019s seat.\u00a0 We are in the middle of a critical election and it\u2019s important that Americans have a voice in filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court. And, while the president may not like it, his flawed strategy of overstepping his authority is simply unacceptable. President Obama attempted to downplay the rebuke he suffered in this immigration case, but the legal background in this case is important to understand. The Obama Executive action was challenged in federal court by Texas which led 25 other states in challenging the program President Obama announced in November 2014. We\u2019ve been involved in this case from the beginning, when I testified before Congress on this very issue in 2014, and we\u2019ve filed briefs in both the district court and the Fifth Circuit on behalf of 113 Members of Congress and hundreds of thousands of Americans. At the Supreme Court, we filed an amicus brief on behalf of more than 337,400 Americans. The Supreme Court\u2019s order Thursday means that President Obama\u2019s Executive overreach continues to be thwarted in federal court every step of the way. The injunction means the president can\u2019t move forward with his plan seeking to give quasi-legal status and work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants. The case will move forward on the merits in federal district court in southern Texas.\u00a0 The latest developments in that case have involved the federal judge sanctioning Obama Administration attorneys from the Department of Justice for \u201cintentionally deceptive\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d actions. Throughout the course of this case, our message has been simple and direct: The constitutional system is simple.\u00a0 Congress makes the laws.\u00a0 The President enforces the laws.\u00a0 And the courts interpret the laws. Even now, I still remember the words from the trial court that was absolutely correct in finding that President Obama \u201cis not just rewriting the laws, he is creating them from scratch.\u201d President Obama is not a king. He needs to stop acting like one.",

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream reports from Washington, D.C. Fifteen minutes was all it took to show why Justice Anthony Kennedy remains a power on the U.S. Supreme Court when he provided decisive double-play votes last week, Sitting with his seven colleagues on the bench last Thursday, the senior associate justice was finishing reading a portion of his key ruling to keep in place the University of Texas' admission criteria, which takes race into account as one of many factors to ensure a diverse campus. \"It remains an enduring challenge to our nation's education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity,\u201d concluded Kennedy in his low-key clipped voice. Then just before the public session was over, another bombshell: the court dealt a setback to President Obama's unilateral executive action on immigration. The 4-4 ruling, where Kennedy this time backed his right-leaning colleagues, was a victory for states and the GOP Congress that opposed the administration's plan to shield millions of undocumented aliens from possible deportation. Four days later, on the last public session before the summer recess, the final dramatic act: the court by a 5-3 vote struck down a Texas law imposing tough regulations on clinics performing abortions. Kennedy, pivoting again to the left, was the deciding factor to conclude the regulations placed an \"undue burden\" on women seeking access to the medical procedure, affirming earlier precedent that Kennedy himself helped establish. Now more than ever, the court's unapologetic \"swing vote\" is quietly flexing his judicial power on a dizzying mix of hot-button cases. That has been particularly true since his friend and conservative colleague Antonin Scalia passed away in February, leaving the court short-handed for the foreseeable future. Republicans in the Senate have vowed not to confirm Obama's nominee-- Judge Merrick Garland-- leaving the possibility the seat will remain unfilled until next year, when the next President would choose It has left a strategic void that makes Kennedy's unique jurisprudence that much more coveted among his colleagues. Amid uncertainty, he quietly thrives. Do the math: the four reliable liberals and three reliable conservatives now orbit around Kennedy's moderate-conservative credentials, knowing he almost inevitably will provide the crucial deciding vote.\u00a0 While the justice mostly holds to the right, he can move comfortably away when he sees fit. \"The basic principle is, it is Justice Kennedy's world and you just live in it,\" said Thomas Goldstein, a private appellate attorney and creator of scotusblog.com. \"On a court of nine members there almost has to be someone in the middle by definition.\u00a0 His job where he sits on this court is to cast the deciding vote sometimes.\" ___________ After the recent abortion and affirmative action decisions, many political conservatives are now lamenting that Kennedy, who turns 80 this month,\u201d may be a \u201clost cause,\u201d since he had previously sided with the right to a large extent on these issues. The fear on the right is that with the election of a Democratic president, Scalia's replacement would be poised to establish a solid five-vote liberal majority, breaking a quarter-century or more lock held by the right. In order to preserve his crucial role, some legal experts think Kennedy may be setting the groundwork to go left and stay there, hoping to lead that bloc in his final years on the bench. \"Increasingly we are seeing him swinging to the left more and more, this has been really evident in the last few terms where we have seen liberals get historic victories,\" in cases including same-sex marriage, said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network. She told Fox News that despite a reputation as defending states\u2019 rights over federal control. \"I think we see increasingly Justice Kennedy is willing to abandon some those core principles of the constitutional system when it comes to achieving liberal policy goals, and that is discouraging to see.\" But other court watchers-- especially those who know him personally-- think Kennedy will continue to be Kennedy: unpredictably influential and invested on both sides. Many associates deny he is agenda- or legacy-driven. The justice has crafted a powerful, if hard to define, judicial power base-- seemingly in the forefront of every major ruling during his tenure. He was the key behind-the-scenes architect of the 2000 Bush v. Gore drama, a 1992 opinion upholding abortion rights, and perhaps his crowning achievement, last year's decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Kennedy's \"Greatest Hits\" as the key author or swing vote on the high court could fill multiple volumes. He has written majority decisions on campaign spending laws, underage killers, and foreign fighters held by the U-S military in the war on terror. And along with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the two native westerners carved out a jumpy place in the center, before she stepped down a decade ago. Less driven by practical concerns than O'Connor, Kennedy has striven for a loftier sense of the law's impact on society, such as a 1992 opinion affirming Roe v. Wade, but allowing for \"reasonable\" state restrictions: \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\" That earned him nicknames inside and out of the court: Flipper, Errant Voyager, Man in the Muddle. Kennedy's complex, some say unique, views on the law leave little room for consensus among his supporters and detractors. His rulings have been described as both inspired and grandiloquent. \"Justice Kennedy is a man who really doesn't know his own mind,\" said Douglas Kmiec, a former Justice Department lawyer who helped formally vet Kennedy to the high court in 1987. \"And that's not meant entirely as a criticism, because the positive way to say that is: he's open-minded.\" \"He has not been a justice to look at overarching principles, one rule that settles every case,\" said Orin Kerr, his law clerk from 2003. \"His decisions are considered unpredictable because he's not always going to rule in favor of the government, he's not always going in favor of a defendant. He's going to look case by case and that makes his decisions distinctive.\" He has generally supported his conservative colleagues on issues of crime, the death penalty, federalism, and civil rights. But also has backed the left on abortion, homosexual rights, and school prayer. \"These labels have meaning only relative to the other justices, so it has turned out Justice Kennedy has been in the middle of the court, pretty much since his appointment,\" said Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, his law clerk from 2001. \"His judicial philosophy didn't necessarily create a clean answer to every case, so he would have to think them through case by case.\" And a judicial confidence in the California native's own role, and that of the court he has shaped, has long been evident. Judges, he once said, have power and duty to \"impose order on a disordered reality.\" As for Kennedy himself, \"sometimes people think compromise means squishy, centrist,\" he has said. \"It doesn't.\"",

            "article_content": "Kate Steinle's family reacts on 'The O'Reilly Factor' San Francisco officials plan to take another run at clarifying sanctuary protections for people who are in the country illegally, a policy that landed the city in national hot water last year when a Mexican man shot and killed a woman walking along a waterfront pier. The Board of Supervisors will consider a proposal Tuesday that spells out when law enforcement can turn over criminal suspects to federal immigration authorities. The measure calls for law officers to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement only if a defendant is charged with a violent crime and has been convicted of a violent crime within the last seven years. That would be the only time city workers, including police officers, could disclose immigration status. But San Francisco's sheriff has resisted the limitation, saying that she wants greater discretion over what is a relatively small pool of detainees. The sheriff, as a constitutionally elected official, does not have to follow the board's orders. The measure's chief sponsor, Supervisor John Avalos, postponed a vote on the ordinance earlier this month, saying that he wanted everyone on the same page. Advocates of sanctuary protections say a clear division between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is needed to foster trust. The law dates back to 1989. The killing of Kate Steinle in July 2015 and the arrest of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez put San Francisco's leaders on the defensive as critics and outside politicians called for a change in the city's sanctuary law. The sheriff at the time cited the law in defending the release of the man, a repeat drug offender and habitual border-crosser. He lost re-election to a candidate who said she would have considered greater communication between the city and federal governments. Sheriff Vicki Hennessey has said that the office receives about five requests a week to notify ICE of a detainee's status. She has not notified ICE in any of those cases, she said. Hennessey also said that, like her predecessor, she may have ignored ICE's request for notification about Lopez-Sanchez, but at least she would have reviewed his case.",

            "article_content": "Bias Bash: Syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor Cal Thomas weighs in on the lack of objectivity by reporters when covering Donald Trump compared with Hillary Clinton Anyone supporting Donald Trump is \u201cmorally tainted,\u201d ABC and NPR commentator Cokie Roberts declared Tuesday, while making no mention of possible ethical dilemmas facing backers of Hillary Clinton. Roberts, who has been unabashed in going after the Republican presidential nominee, told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that her Southern upbringing gives her the insight and authority to know Trump\u2019s candidacy was a \u201cstain,\u201d taking the country back in that direction. \u201cThey\u2019re morally tainted,\u201d Roberts said of the 40 percent or so of American voters who polls say support Trump. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s just no question about that. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever seen anything like this,\u201d the 72-year-old continued. \u201cNot only did I grow up in politics, I grew up in the Jim Crow South. And we spent the last 50 years trying to bring people together instead of push people apart. And so that becomes a terrible stain on the country.\u201d No mention was made of Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of a yearlong federal inquiry that led FBI Director James Comey to call her \u201cextremely careless\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d in her handling of sensitive emails, and to say she was not truthful in public claims about her actions. In addition, Clinton is now reportedly the subject of an investigation by multiple U.S. Attorneys looking at ties between her work as Secretary of State and her family\u2019s foundation. Roberts, whose parents were Democratic members of Congress, has made her feelings about Trump clear before. In February, the syndicated newspaper column she writes with her husband, Steve Roberts, called for \u201cthe rational wing\u201d of the Republican Party to stop Trump. \"[Trump] is one of the least qualified candidates ever to make a serious run for the presidency,\" the couple wrote. \"If he is nominated by a major party -- let alone elected -- the reputation of the United States would suffer a devastating blow around the world.\" The column put her in a tough spot with NPR, whose policy forbids journalists from being subjective on political candidates. Roberts followed the column up with a harsh grilling of Trump on MSNBC on March 9, asking him about his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border and charging that the position stoked racism. Trump brings out the boas in journalists like Roberts. (Associated Press) \"Are you proud of that?\u201d Roberts pressed. \u201cIs that something you've done in American political and social discourse that you're proud of?\" Roberts\u2019 bias was so clear that NPR Editorial Director Michael Oreskes wrote in a memo to staffers that news executives would have to redefine her \u00a0job. \"Our journalists have clear instructions,\" Oreskes wrote in his memo, sent to staffers Monday morning. \"We do not support or oppose candidates. We don't advise political parties. We gather the news and seek as many points of view as we can. Cokie's role has evolved into being one of those points of view.\" Roberts has weighed in on Hillary Clinton, telling ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, a former Clinton staffer, that anti-Hillary sentiment was due to sexism. Citing an unnamed poll in the April, 2015 interview, Roberts referenced \"research that shows that a woman who is strong and powerful is seen as not friendly and empathetic.\" \"Here we are in 2015...and we still have to deal with that,\" Roberts lamented. \"[Clinton] is running against herself. She's trying to figure out how to show people how she's a warm and friendly person.\"",

The emails in question were deemed classified before their release by the department \u2013 and the former secretary of state has said all along she never sent emails with material marked classified at the time. But the large number of emails containing now-classified material further underscores how much sensitive information was crossing her private server, a situation her critics have described as a security risk\u2026Her email practices are also the subject of a federal investigation.\u201dHealth worries detailed - The newly released emails reveal that Clinton insiders appeared to be more concerned about her health than they let on in public following the secretary of state\u2019s December 2012 concussion.

It was last update [sic] on 12/26/12.\u2019\u2026 In a January 25, 2013 e-mail titled \u2018Benghazi,\u2019 she appeared unaware that the department was warning Americans not to travel to the embattled Libyan city. \u2018Since the Brits, Germans and Dutch have told their citizens to leave Benghazi, why aren\u2019t we doing the same?\u2019 she asked her top staff, citing a report from NPR.\u00a0Kennedy explained that the department had already told American citizens not to travel to Benghazi on January 2 \u2014 a warning they had reiterated on January 24, just one day before her e-mail.\u201dTelling her what she wants to hear - Emails also reveal how Clinton\u2019s sycophants pounced on critics of her 2013 appearance before a Senate committee hearing in which Clinton dismissed questions about the motivation the Benghazi attackers bellowing \u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d When Mark Penn, Clinton\u2019s 2008 political strategist wrote her saying \u201cI don\u2019t think the emotion in the hearing works to your advantage -- looks more like they rattled you on something no one outside the crazy right blamed you for anyway\u201d top aide Philippe Reines brushed Penn\u2019s concerns aside, emailing Clinton: \u201cMark\u2019s analysis is that it repeats the same flawed assumption that underpinned his advice in 2008; namely, that being yourself is risky.\u201d \u201cBINGO!!\u201d Clinton responded.Warren bides her time, skips Hillary fundraiser - ABC News: \u201c[T]he progressive lawmaker from Massachusetts, was the only female Democratic senator who wasn\u2019t at Monday\u2019s D.C.] endorsement event and fundraiser for Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.

The already paranoid Stalin saw Kirov\u2019s rise to leader of the Communist Party in Leningrad as a new provocation, despite Kirov\u2019s long support for Stalin. Historians also believe that Kirov\u2019s hedonistic lifestyle was an embarrassment to Stalin\u2019s push for ascetic conformity in the new workers\u2019 paradise. Stalin was publicly supportive of his old comrade, proffering \u2013 and then deferring \u2013 promotions to high office in Moscow. But all the while, Stalin was plotting. With the help of one of Kirov\u2019s security deputies, Stalin found an assassin to take out his could-be rival. Of the millions Stalin killed, Kirov\u2019s death still stands out. The murder was the pretext that Stalin would use to launch the next and most dramatic round of the purge of his enemies from within Soviet government and life. The enemies of the revolution, Stalin said, were responsible for Kirov\u2019s murder and needed to be rooted out.\u00a0 How right he was\u2026 Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Const. Scott Heron was charged in September 2012 following an investigation into an operation involving the purchasing cases of cheese in bulk from south of the border and bringing it into Fort Erie without declaring the cheese or paying duty. Once in Canada, the cheese was sorted and prepared for distribution to a variety of restaurants in the region. At the time of the arrest, the NRP said there was significant money to be made from the operation. Police say about $200,000 worth of cheese was smuggled in, generating a profit of about $165,000.\u201dAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThe idea that the terrorists attacked in Paris because they wanted to prevent the leaders of the world of having a meeting over the rise of the ocean in a hundred years is simply absurd.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201dChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "The number of families and unaccompanied children apprehended on southern border has skyrocketed, according to new Obama administration stats. David V. Aguilar, the former Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, goes 'On the Record' A surge of unaccompanied children coming across the southern border could be swelling the ranks of one of America\u2019s most dangerous gangs, either as fresh recruits or hardened sleepers, according to federal authorities. Some 227,149 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the border over the last six years, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. They remain in federal custody until a sponsor can be located, at which time they are often sent to communities where they are ripe for recruitment by Latin gangs such as the infamous MS-13. \u201cOur safety standards have increased,\u201d Andrea Helling, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIn the last few months screening procedures of children and sponsors has increased in their intensity which we hadn\u2019t done previously.\u201d MS 13 started in the prisons of El Salvador, but has spread throughout the continent. (Associated Press) Federal law requires the Department of Homeland Security transfer children under 18 to the custody of Helling\u2019s agency until they are released to an appropriate sponsor, usually a relative, while their immigration cases are adjudicated. Some observers say that, at the least, the process sends a steady stream of loosely supervised youths lacking in language and coping skills right into the waiting arms of criminal gangs. At worst, the unaccompanied minors were already initiated into the gangs before they arrived at the border. MS-13 is believed to be among the largest street gangs on New York\u2019s Long Island, and more than 250 members have been convicted on federal felony charges since 2003. Federal prosecutors there have pinned more than 20 murders on the violent gang. Meanwhile, over the last year, Long Island has received 2,093 unaccompanied children, and between October 2013 and July 2016, all of New York received 12,478 children from Central America. The overwhelming majority of the kids are not criminals and likely have competent sponsors. But some are. In June 2015, MS-13 members and El Salvadoran immigrants Jose Cornejo, 17, Bryan Larios, 18 and Joel Escobar, 17, all of Brentwood, N.Y. were charged with the brutal rape of a 16 year-old girl on a local golf course. Earlier this week, Joshua Guzman, 15, was shot and killed in the Long Island city of Hempstead. While not an unaccompanied immigrant, the boy\u2019s father, Raul Guzman, told Newsday his son was under pressure to join a gang. Police believe his murder may be related. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the possibility,\u201d said Lt. Richard LeBrun, spokesman, Nassau County Police Department, that Guzman\u2019s murder could be gang related. MS-13 has a foothold in numerous other communities, where unaccompanied minors are being sent. Texas, which has seen a spike in MS-13 crime has received 15,999 over the same period. The 2015 Texas Department of Public Safety Gang Threat Assessment found MS-13 boasts some 800 members, and authorities explicitly blamed the flood of unaccompanied children being placed in the state. \u201cThe influx of illegal alien gang members crossing the border into Texas in 2014, along with reports of extremely violent murders committed by its members in the Houston area, positions the gang as one of the most significant gang threats in the state for this upcoming year,\u201d the report stated. Other areas that have seen an influx in MS-13 crime are Maryland, Texas, and Virginia. Fairfax County, Va. has seen a 160 percent increase in MS-13 related incidents through April compared to the previous year. Helling said HHS is looking more closely at the sponsors who step forward to take custody of the minors. \u201cOur responsibility is providing a safe place for these children,\u201d she said. She said that high-risk children who may have been identified as gang members by DHS would likely be placed in either a staff secure or secure-juvenile detention facility. But even if they are not gang members when they come into the U.S., the risk remains that they could fall prey to recruitment efforts.",

            "article_content": "Hillary spokesman rips billionaire The 2016 presidential race now appears in full scandal mode -- with accusations this weekend about Donald Trump being a tax dodger and Hillary Clinton being privately indifferent to the millennial voters whose support she needs -- with no end in sight. To be sure, Trump has even vowed to bring up at the next presidential debate claims about former President Bill Clinton having extra-marital affairs and wife Hillary\u2019s apparent attempts to silence the women accusers -- despite fellow Republicans urging him to avoid such a strategy. And he suggested Saturday that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, might have been unfaithful to her husband. On Sunday, Trump, the Republican nominee, seemed ready to refocus on policy and his effective economic agenda -- at least slightly more. \u201cI have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!\u201d tweeted Trump, referring to the now-closed federal investigation into Clinton using a private server system while secretary of state. With about five weeks remaining before Election Day, Clinton holds a slight lead over Trump, according to most polls published after their debate last week in which Trump appeared to get off track in the closing stages. A Fox News Channel poll released Friday shows Clinton leading by 5 percentage points, 49-to-44 percent. The fresh round of accusations started Friday when an audiotape of a Clinton fundraiser in February surfaced and revealed her candid albeit unflattering portrait of millennials, then turned Saturday night to speculation about whether Trump has paid federal taxes since the mid-1990s, following a New York Times report. \u201cBombshell,\u201d Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted after the story, which appeared to show Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 IRS return and speculated that he might not have paid federal taxes for the next 18 years, as a result. However, such speculation, amid Trump, a New York real estate mogul, not releasing his tax returns, was beat back Sunday by top surrogates and advisers. \u201cNo apologies for complying with the law,\u201d New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He argued that Trump showed business \u201cgenius\u201d in using the laws to his advantage and that he is the best candidate to fix the laws that are an \u201cabsolute mess.\u201d \u201cThis was actually a very, very good story for him,\u201d Christie continued. \u201c\u201cYou don\u2019t know that he didn\u2019t pay taxes. Let\u2019s be precise about what (the story) said.\u201d Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d described Trump as an \"absolute genius\" in how he used tax law to his advantage. In the audiotape released Friday -- which was purportedly hacked from an email, then given to The Washington Free Beacon -- Clinton portrays millennial as \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement\u201d and as college-educated \u201cbaristas\u201d concerned about a bleak economic future. However, she warns about overpromising them, as primary rival-turned campaign supporter Bernie Sanders did. Sanders, a Vermont senator, acknowledged Sunday on CNN that he was bothered by Clinton\u2019s comments, saying his and her campaigns still have \u201creal differences,\u201d beyond their mutual interest in defeating Trump. \u201cCrooked H is nasty to Sanders supporters behind closed doors,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOwned by Wall St and Politicians, HRC is not with you.\u201d The campaigns, which historically go into full attack mode in the final weeks, could return to arguments about policy and platforms when the vice-presidential nominees -- Virginia Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine and Indian GOP Gov. Mike Pence -- meet Tuesday in their first-and-only debate of the election cycle. However, both are veteran politicians who have rigorously attacked Trump and Clinton, respectively, and will likely include such tactics when they go face to face. Clinton made a stop Sunday at a church in Charlotte, N.C., an event postponed because of rioting late last month after a police officer fatally shot a black male. Trump held a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, where he made no mention of the Miss Universe winner, whom Clinton said during the debate Monday was verbally abused by Trump. Trump spent much of the rest of the week attacking the pageant queen\u2019s character, even implying she participated in a sex tape and arguing that Clinton had been duped into championing her. \u201cI don't even think she's loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really folks, why should she be, right?\u201d he told the crowd in Pennsylvania, a critical state in Clinton and Trump\u2019s path toward the White House. Trump returns to the campaign trail Monday with an event in northern Virginia, while Clinton makes two stops in battleground Ohio, where Trump now appears to be doing especially well. Her visit comes about one week prior to Ohio's voter-registration deadline, October 11, and the start of early voting, October 12. On Wednesday, President Obama will stump for Clinton in the Miami-area of Florida, another key state for both candidates and where their race also remains close.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, is accompanied by his running mate, Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, during a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday October 22, 2016. (AP Photo / Evan Vucci) Here\u2019s the astonishing truth the media\u2019s not talking about and Democrats refuse to believe \u2014 Donald Trump is getting more than double, and sometimes more than triple, the black vote Romney got 4 years ago. Recent polling by Remington Research shows Trump getting 22% in Florida, Romney got 5 percent. In North Carolina, Trump\u2019s getting 19%, Romney got 4 percent.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s getting 22% of black voters in Wisconsin compared with Romney\u2019s 6% 4 years ago.\u00a0 And in Pennsylvania, Trump scores an astounding 29% against Romney\u2019s 7% share in 2012. Nationally, Romney received less than 7% of the black vote in 2012.\u00a0 Even Trump\u2019s worst numbers among African-Americans show him getting 19%, and some polls show him doing much better. Even more exciting for Republican prospects, increasing black support is not confined to Trump.\u00a0 In Wisconsin, Ron Johnson has pulled even in his race for re-election to the U.S. Senate thanks largely to black defection from the Democrat party.\u00a0 A CNN poll shows Rob Portman getting 32% of non-white voters in Ohio, mostly African Americans.\u00a0 In North Carolina, a Quinnipiac Poll shows Richard Burr gets 24% of the ethnic vote, most of them African Americans. Generally, there are three reasons African-Americans are voting in record numbers for Republicans this year. First, for the first time since anyone can remember, Republicans have broken the communications monopoly Democrats have enjoyed among African-Americans. Trump is persistently reaching out to them; visiting their churches and neighborhoods, making a commitment to rebuild America\u2019s cities, economy and jobs. Second, Trump\u2019s not the only one speaking to African Americans. The organization I am honored to Chair, the 2016 Committee \u2014 best known for our successful effort to draft Dr. Ben Carson into the presidential race \u2014 has, in the last three months, raised and spent more than $1.3 million in 6 battleground states on radio ads targeted to African American voters.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s an ad effort focused on Trump, but providing real value for Republicans down-ticket as well. Our ad campaign is based on concrete test data. In fact, the predecessor to The 2016 Committee, the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, ran a test of this approach in the North Carolina Senate race two years ago which pit incumbent Kay Hagen against challenger Thom Tillis. We ran radio ads for 8 weeks in that part of North Carolina where just under two-thirds of African Americans live.\u00a0 Radio ads were not run in the northern tier of the state on the Virginia border, nor in the southern crescent adjacent to the South Carolina border. Rasmussen polling before the ads started showed that Kay Hagen was winning 99% of the African American vote -- about the same support she received in 2008 with Barack Obama at the top of the ticket.\u00a0 A few weeks after the ads started running polls indicated a notable shift in black voter preference. On election day, exit polls taken by Rasmussen showed Thom Tillis received 11.9% of the African-American vote statewide.\u00a0 This is clearly a result of the more than $300,000 worth of radio ads run by the Committee. As further validation, Tillis received precisely the result you\u2019d expect if he won 1% of the black vote where the ads did not run and 18% in the areas where ads could be heard. The third and most significant reason for the shift in African- American voter preferences this year is African-Americans have grown weary of shopworn liberal policies aimed at buying black votes while limiting black opportunity and prosperity. Hillary promises to double down on those failed policies. The 2016 Committee\u2019s radio ads make the case with examples from three broad issue areas:\u00a0 education, jobs and abortion. Our ads show how Hillary\u2019s unconditional support for teachers\u2019 unions and opposition to charter schools condemn poor children to continuing poverty. We discuss Hillary\u2019s support for higher taxes, more regulation and bigger government \u2014 the liberal trifecta that restricts minorities to the economic hole leftist policies have anchored them in, prohibits job growth in the private sector, and guarantees deteriorating living conditions. And we point out that despite boasting of her work for kids, she defends abortion in horrifically painful ways right up to the last hour even though one of three babies aborted in America is black.\u00a0 How can she take for granted black votes when she isn\u2019t interested in protecting the lives of black babies? Those who claim a Trump win depends entirely on his running the board with white voters are missing a historic shift in party alignment that will profoundly impact American politics. Given the growing desperation of minorities victimized by liberal policies for the last 6 decades, it can\u2019t happen soon enough.",

(AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Press gobbles up Hillary\u2019s spam campaign \u2022 Obama says chlorine not a chemical weapon \u2022 R.I.P. B.B. \u2022 Jeb returns to Iowa amid a changing race \u2022 Col. Crockett would have known better PRESS GOBBLES UP HILLARY\u2019S SPAM CAMPAIGNThe Clinton campaign is like a funhouse mirror version the Obama White House. Tightly controlled press access has become no press access. Opaque accountability has become concrete-thick secrecy. Augmenting traditional public interactions with, um, unconventional outreach has become a public persona that is just a Spam loaf of stagy interactions. With the help of a cadre of Obama insiders who pioneered the style, Hillary Clinton is on an expedition into the deep space of an airless, utterly contrived campaign. And guess what? It\u2019s working. She and her team are probably delighted in their ability to run for president without actually running and without having to play by the rules (again). Consider how well it\u2019s working for the presumptive Democratic nominee: She is way out of the mainstream on abortion but issues a statement condemning Republicans for passing a popular a late-term ban on elective abortions \u2013 no questions asked of her. She has not complied with the bipartisan request of the Benghazi committee \u2013 no questions asked of her. A news anchor who grilled her accuser on using her family foundation to funnel payola is found to be a donor to the foundation \u2013 no questions asked of her. She actually voted for the Iraq war that Jeb Bush is getting pelted with clods over \u2013 no questions asked of her. She is likely to be the first female major party nominee in American history and yet the current president of her own party is accused of sexism against a prominent senator and potential rival -- no questions asked of her. And on and on and on\u2026 We arrived at the point where a major party candidate soaked in scandals can flout accountability point not because Hillary Clinton is an especially gifted politician (she isn\u2019t) or because she\u2019s oligarch rich (others have been before her) or even because she is a Democrat (no one has even gotten a free pass this size before) but mostly because she is sewing ground plowed already by Barack Obama. The press was at most sulky and at worst codependent about getting locked out, knocked down, lied to and generally ignored by the Obama White House. Now we see what is usually true in politics: The next round is worse. Obama ignored campaign finance norms; Bush is circumventing the rules completely. Bush\u2019s brother ran a somewhat negative re-election campaign of defining a challenger as unfit for command; Obama ran an overwhelmingly negative campaign immolating his challenger\u2019s character. The pendulum only swings one way. There is no appropriate story about Clinton\u2019s candidacy to cover until she has answered the questions that relate to her fitness for office. It is, in that sense, the only story. Discussing her canned campaign events through any prism other than the scandals that she has flatly refused to address is an invitation to further ignominy. If you go and give her mainstream coverage of her talking points to augment store-bought \u201cmessaging\u201d while allowing her to refuse to be accountable, what do you think will happen next? Which direction did Obama go? Certainly not toward accountability and access. For members of a profession that is on the brink of being replaced by \u201ccontent\u201d synthesizers, those in the political press are certainly not making a very strong argument for their continued necessity.Power Play: When will Hillary\u2019s free pass expire? - With a tweet here and a tweet there Hillary Clinton has been keeping a tight lid on her campaign.

However, chlorine gas \u2013 which Assad\u2019s government is now accused of using -- was not a part of that agreement. Obama gave a nuanced response Thursday, noting that chlorine isn't an internationally banned chemical weapon. However, he said, \u2018when it is used in this fashion, [it] can be considered a prohibited use of that particular chemical. And so we're working with the international community to investigate that. Last week, others in Obama\u2019s administration called for an immediate U.N. investigation into the \u2018abhorrent acts\u2019 \u2013 without saying what, if any, punishment Assad might face if formally blamed for the string of alleged chlorine gas attacks.\u201dWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Riley B. King, known and loved the world over as \u201cB.B.,\u201d died Thursday in Las Vegas at age 89. One of the greatest guitarists and blues musicians of all-time, King was born on a cotton plantation outside of Itta Bena, Miss. in 1925. He picked up his stage name as a 20-year-old radio disc jockey and singer in Memphis as \u201cthe Beale Street Blues Boy,\u201d later just \u201cB.B.\u201d If you don\u2019t know King from before his mainstream revival (and role as commercial pitchman) following his performance on U2\u2019s 1988 blues/rock/gospel hit \u201cWhen Love Comes to Town,\u201d you should watch King perform \u201cThree O\u2019Clock Blues,\u201d which was his first hit in 1951 and an enduring live standard. It\u2019s a borrowed blues number King imbues with the country twang and sophisticated jazz arrangement that were the hallmarks of his style. You\u2019ll also get to see how he seems to be electrified by the current flowing through his guitar. Many great musicians play in such a way that their instruments seem to be extensions of themselves. But King played like a man in the ecstatic thrall of his instrument. King exclusively played Gibson guitars, which he always called \u201cLucille.\u201d King explained the origin of the name to audiences in an ode: \u201cI was over in Twist, Arkansas \u2026 One night the guys started a brawl, started brawling, you know what I mean. The guy that was mad with his old lady, when she fell over on this gas tank that was burning for heat, the gas ran all over the floor.

Aside from Bush\u2019s week of struggles with his brother\u2019s legacy, the establishment frontrunner has also decided to skip the state party\u2019s straw poll in August. This prompted fresh (if unsupported) speculation that Bush might skip Iowa entirely.

Bush\u2019s most likely strategy, helped in no small measure by adviser David Kochel (who ran Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 and 2012 Iowa campaigns), will be to make what inroads he can, set the target low and come off with a respectable showing.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate the war in Syria, Russia and defeating ISIS The second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis was do or die for Donald Trump; against all odds he survived to fight another day. Dead on arrival, however, was any pretense of civility between Hillary Clinton and her GOP opponent. In the wake of the damaging tape which revealed Trump boasting about his sexual assaults on women, a smug Hillary Clinton refused to shake hands with her opponent as they gathered at Washington University. She called Trump unfit for the presidency and on numerous occasions she accused him of lying. He countered by suggesting that if he were elected, she would go to jail. Given the preceding two days of all-out assault on Trump, his ability to rally and put Hillary on the defensive allowed him to declare victory and regain some lost ground. To the delight of his followers, Trump put Hillary on the griddle for much of the evening. He deftly parried questions about his crude misogynist remarks by saying he was embarrassed by them and had apologized. He then quickly pivoted to a sustained attack on Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment and record. To the delight of his followers, Trump put Hillary on the griddle for much of the evening. He deftly parried questions about his crude misogynist remarks by saying he was embarrassed by them and had apologized. He then quickly pivoted to a sustained attack on Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment and record. During the 90-minute town-hall style gathering moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, Trump managed to cite Hillary\u2019s destruction of emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, her ignoring of the 600 pleas for help from Chris Stevens, our ambassador who was killed at Benghazi, her enthusiasm for admitting Syrian refugees into the country despite security concerns, her wavering support of the TPP, the leaked tapes that reveal her inclination to say one thing in private and another in public, Obamacare\u2019s failings and so forth. In short, he did what he had failed to do in the first debate: remind Americans of what they do not like about Hillary Clinton. He also, remarkably, moved past the incriminating tape, leaving a sputtering Hillary in the rear view mirror. Given the near-hysteria with which the media had fastened on the recording of Trump boasting about fondling women against their wishes, and the outrage expressed by many across the political spectrum, Mrs. Clinton might have expected that Trump would be in retreat, and that the hall of spectators would be on her side. Not so. The first applause of the evening, which the moderators had warned against, met Trump\u2019s assertion that Hillary Clinton had demeaned and attacked the women who had accused husband Bill of sexual assault or rape. Trump had invited four of those women to participate in a press conference before the debate, signaling that he was ready to give as good as he got. He did just that and at least some in the Washington University hall seemed to approve his calling the Clintons out for hypocrisy. That wasn\u2019t the only issue on which he attacked Hillary. He brought up the dirty tricks campaign waged against Bernie Sanders by Clinton in cahoots with the Democratic National Committee; Hillary dove for cover behind the narrative that Putin is trying to upset our election to benefit Trump. He discussed her speeches to donors wherein she notes the advantage of having one position in public and another in private; in one of the more peculiar rebuttals of the evening, Clinton (as the Donald described it) blamed Abraham Lincoln. As opposed to the first debate, Trump seemed sure of his ground \u2013 able to discuss law and order, the inner city blight, tax proposals, our low growth rate, the failures of Obamacare, the Iran deal, and the current administration\u2019s hostility to our energy industry \u2013 and called her out for her \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d remark. On numerous occasions he said of Clinton: \u201cshe\u2019s all talk and no action.\u201d With 63 percent of the country saying we are on the wrong track, Trump making himself the candidate of change and charging Hillary with being the defender of the Status Quo is powerful; that\u2019s what he needed to do. As before, Trump\u2019s weakest performance (and Hillary\u2019s strongest) was in dealing with questions about foreign policy. When asked what he would do about the humanitarian disaster in Aleppo, Trump faltered. He shifted the conversation to Mosul, and reiterated his charge that our military is doing badly in its fight against ISIS, but proffered no serious solutions. Clinton repeated her insistence on a \u201cno-fly\u201d zone and said she would target ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, suggesting she had used similar tactics in fighting Al-Qaeda and reminding the audience of her experience in that realm. Hillary touted her background not only in traveling the world and fighting terror but also her lifelong commitment to children and families. This is her best resume item, but Trump undermined her recital by pointing out that she had failed to bring jobs to New York State, a pivotal pledge from her time as senator. Both candidates were asked what kind of judge they might appoint to the Supreme Court. Hillary channeled Barack Obama, who memorably went looking for \u201cempathy\u201d and apparently found that quality in Sonia Sotomayor. Clinton scored some points by saying she would look for a justice who would support Roe vs. Wade and marriage equality. She waded into deep water saying she would also appoint someone who would overturn Citizens United, and get dark money out of politics. That was a mistake. Clinton is the master at sucking up dark money, and has built a war chest several times the size of Trump\u2019s by \u201cdoing an end-run around contribution limits,\u201d as the New York Times recently reported. Trump said he would appoint someone like Scalia, who would defend the Constitution of the United States. He got another jab in by saying his pick for the Court would, unlike Hillary\u2019s likely choice, stand up for the second amendment. The debate in St. Louis was not a confrontation that made either candidate look noble or appealing. Trump, however, picked himself up off the mat and proved he is still in the race to win. If this election comes down to voters deciding whom they\u2019d rather have a beer with, the temperance movement may get a second life.",

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream reports from Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked President Obama\u2019s immigration executive actions, in a tie decision that delivers a win to states challenging his plan to give a deportation reprieve to millions of illegal immigrants. The justices' one-sentence opinion on Thursday marks a major setback for the administration, effectively killing the plan for the duration of Obama's presidency. The judgment\u00a0could have significant political and legal consequences in a presidential election year highlighted by competing rhetoric over immigration. As the ruling was announced, pro-immigration activists filled the sidewalk in front of the court, some crying as the ruling became public. Critics of the policy touted the decision as a strong statement against \"executive abuses.\" \"The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws\u2014only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, adding that the ruling rendered Obama's actions \"null and void.\" Obama, though, said the decision \u201ctakes us further from the country that we aspire to be.\u201d He stressed that earlier changes his administration made to immigration policy are not affected, but acknowledged his most recent 2014 changes cannot go forward and additional executive actions are unlikely. While Obama accepted the ruling, he also made his own full-court press, saying the split decision underscores the importance of the current court vacancy and the appointment of a successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to \"break this tie.\" So far, Senate Republicans have not considered Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. \"The court's inability to reach a decision in this case is a very clear reminder of why it's so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench,\" he said Thursday at the White House. The 4-4 tie vote sets no national precedent but leaves in place the ruling by the lower court. In this case, the federal appeals court in New Orleans said the Obama administration lacked the authority to shield up to 4 million immigrants from deportation and make them eligible for work permits without approval from Congress. Texas led 26 Republican-dominated states in challenging the program Obama announced in November 2014. Congressional Republicans also backed the states' lawsuit. The decision lands in the middle of a heated election season in which immigration is a central issue. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, won the primaries while railing against Obama administration immigration policies as dangerous. Democrats have, in turn, called his rhetoric racially divisive while defending the administration's move to expand existing programs that would effectively give temporary legal status to some undocumented residents. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton countered Ryan's statement saying the decision was \"purely procedural\" and leaves \"no doubt\" the programs were within the president's authority. Referencing the 4-4 split on the court, she again urged the Senate to give Obama's nominee to fill the remaining court vacancy a vote. \"Today\u2019s deadlocked decision from the Supreme Court is unacceptable, and show us all just how high the stakes are in this election,\" Clinton said in a statement. The immigration case dealt with two separate Obama programs. One would allow undocumented immigrants who are parents of either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to live and work in the U.S. without the threat of deportation. The other would expand an existing program to protect from deportation a larger population of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Obama decided to move forward after Republicans won control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, and the chances for an immigration overhaul, already remote, were further diminished. The Senate had passed a broad immigration bill with Democratic and Republican support in 2013, but the measure went nowhere in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. The states quickly went to court to block the Obama initiatives. Their lawsuit was heard initially by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas. Hanen previously had criticized the administration for lax immigration enforcement. Hanen sided with the states, blocking the programs from taking effect. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled for the states, and the Justice Department rushed an appeal to the high court so that it could be heard this term. Texas officials hailed the decision Thursday. \u201cThe action taken by the President was an unauthorized abuse of presidential power that trampled the Constitution, and the Supreme Court rightly denied the President the ability to grant amnesty contrary to immigration laws,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement. \"Today's ruling is also a victory for all law-abiding Americans\u2014including the millions of immigrants who came to America\u00a0following the rule of law.\" Fox News' Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "TUCSON, Ariz. \u2013 The high price tag and slow repairs to a part of the border fence that divides the U.S. and Mexico are of great concern, U.S. Rep. Martha McSally (R-Arizona) said Thursday. McSally wrote a letter to U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske on Thursday after an Associated Press report found the repairs to about 60 feet of fencing cost $730,000. \"Given the limited availability of funding and the need for new, more effective technologies along our southern border, I find the cost of the repairs to be of great concern,\" McSally wrote. Repairs on the 60 feet of rebar-reinforced fencing in Nogales, Arizona, were completed in December, and the federal agency released the cost of the repairs last month after a request by The Associated Press. Agents discovered the downed fence in July after heavy rain in Nogales, Mexico, caused debris to build up against the fence, toppling it. The fence stood between 18 and 26 feet high and extended at least 7 feet underground. It was built in 2011. The debris, which included tree trunks, was so heavy that it crossed into Nogales, Arizona, damaging businesses and mobile homes near the border. City officials last year said they planned on suing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, accusing the agency of failing to open floodgates that would have prevented such strong runoff. But city attorney Julia Holman said Nogales is no longer pursuing that effort. Nicole Ballistrea, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection, said the repairs took so long to complete because workers had to wait for the ground to dry after several days of rainfall. The Border Patrol monitored the area at all times while the fence was down, Customs and Border Protection said. In her letter, McSally questions whether the agency could have taken steps to minimize the damage. Floodgates near the fence weren't opened on time because the rains were too heavy to risk getting near the water, Customs and Border Protection said. McSally is not the first official to criticize the repairs. Arizona Sen. Steve Smith (R-Maricopa) said the cost was too high. \"It sounds like our federal government is not as assiduous as it should be,\" said Smith, a proponent of tighter border security.",

            "article_content": "Senior adviser Tana Goertz sounds off on 'Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro' Top Trump campaign officials on Sunday expressed optimism about recent poll numbers amid the fallout from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s FBI email investigation and sought to defend the Republican presidential nominee's immigration plan in advance of the White House race intensifying after Labor Day. \u201cThe polling data that you showed earlier really tells the tale,\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton is having a hard time being accepted as a truthful and honest candidate vis-\u00e0-vis the American people.\u201d Clinton\u2019s poll numbers have dropped in recent weeks amid further revelations about her use of a private email server while secretary of state and connections between Clinton Foundation donors and the State Department during and after her tenure at the agency. The RealClearPolitics polls average showed Clinton leading Donald Trump by as many as 8 percentage points in mid-August, when the first-time candidate made a series of campaign missteps that some political analysts predicted would be too damaging to overcome. However, the RCP average is now at about 4 points, though Trump trails by larger margins in such key battleground states as Ohio and Pennsylvania. \u201cWe're taking Pennsylvania very seriously,\u201d said Conway, acknowledging Democrats have won there in the past six presidential elections but dismissing the argument that the state is do-or-die for Trump. \u201cWe have several different paths to victory,\u201d she said. The Trump campaign also faced repeated questions Sunday about Trump\u2019s immigration plan, which critics argue is vague on the issues of deportation for illegal immigrants and whether the United States or Mexico will pay for Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the southern U.S. border. GOP vice-presidential nominee Gov. Mike Pence\u00a0said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the plan begins with building the wall for border security and makes a priority of \u201cenforcing the laws of this country,\" including removing \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d and people who've overstayed visas. The Indiana governor also shot back that voters understood the plan, despite repeated questions from some in the media. \"What the American people want to see today is to establish the borders of this country, enforce the laws of this country. And Donald Trump has created a road map to do that,\" said Pence, who bristled at the suggestion that Trump hadn't been definitive enough in explaining his plan. \"Some 10,000 people in Arizona last week, it wasn't the way they see it,\" Pence said. \"As I travel across this country campaigning with Donald Trump and for Donald Trump, I think people hear him loud and clear. And he's been completely consistent on this point.\" Conway faced similar questions -- including one about managing the deportation of millions of people -- after a week in which\u00a0Trump hinted about a possible \u201csoftening\u201d in his immigration stances, met Wednesday with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, then delivered the Arizona speech hours later in which he appeared to return to his hardline positions on immigration. \u201cHe'll manage it the way it should have been managed all along, by enforcing the law and relying upon those law enforcement officers and those (federal immigration) officers to do their job,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut at least you have a presidential candidate putting forth a 10-point plan.\u201d She also criticized Clinton for failing to hold a full-fledged press conference in 274 days and for staying off the campaign trail for several days to fundraise in such wealthy enclaves as the Hamptons and Martha\u2019s Vineyard while campaign spokespeople and surrogates such as running-mate Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine pushed forward in the effort. The Clinton campaign announced Sunday that Clinton would return to the trail Tuesday with an event in Tampa and issued a statement on Trump\u2019s immigration plan, saying it\u2019s an attempt to \u201cmislead\u201d Americans. \u201cDonald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented, something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cWhat we saw today is Mike Pence and Trump\u2019s top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics.\u201d Kaine on Sunday brushed off repeated questions about the FBI investigation of Clinton's secret server, saying she requested the public release of her secretary of state emails and the release of the FBI notes from the agency\u2019s interview with her last month. The federal investigation found that some emails sent or received by Clinton included classified information. However, no criminal charges were recommended. \u201cThe reason these materials are being made public is that Hillary Clinton said I want the public to see them,\u201d Kaine told ABC. \u201cShe said it was a mistake.\u201d Kaine instead pivoted to Trump's refusal to release his tax returns -- many of which Trump says he can't release because they're under audit -- and statements from Trump that appear to show support for how Russian President Vladimir Putin runs his country. \u201cTalk about national security,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cHe has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyber hacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyberattack on the (Democratic National Committee) was likely done by Russia...This is serious business.\u201d",

(AP) A Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee compared Jewish Israeli settlers to termites on Monday\u00a0while speaking at an event sponsored by an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts of the Jewish state. Rep. Hank Johnson, D- Ga., launched into a tirade against Israel and its policies toward the Palestinians, comparing Jewish people who live in disputed territories to \u201ctermites\u201d that destroy homes. Johnson also compared Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a remark that drew vocal agreement from those in the room. \u201cThere has been a steady [stream], almost like termites can get into a residence and eat before you know that you\u2019ve been eaten up and you fall in on yourself, there has been settlement activity that has marched forward with impunity and at an ever increasing rate to the point where it has become alarming,\u201d Johnson said during an event sponsored by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, an anti-Israel organization that galvanizes supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or BDS. Johnson, who in 2010 voiced his fears that Guam would tip over and capsize if too many people resided\u00a0on the island, said that \u201cJewish people\u201d routinely steal land and property from Palestinians.

The ruthless Vladimir Putin, like his predecessor Josef Stalin, may be a useful ally against an even greater evil, but a \u201chighly respected\u201d leader? Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. But Donald Trump\u2019s admiration for and defense of Putin isn\u2019t wacky or ill-informed. It is evidence of how American politics is becoming increasingly European in nature. Trump often sounds like European \u201cfar-right\u201d leaders with his focus restoring nationalistic vigor and the dangers of foreign migrants. But never more so than with his recent Putin praise. That\u2019s a longstanding trait of Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful far right parties. They admire Putin. He helps them disrupt the political order in their home countries. And that helps him gain the upper hand in his effort to make Russia the world\u2019s dominant power. That\u2019s not to say that the admiration isn\u2019t sincere. The European nationalists and Trump admire Putin\u2019s strength, his explicit targeting of Islamism and his championing of traditional values. And it is all made possible by the failure of the European system. And never has it looked so obviously failed as of late. Aside from decades of economic stagnation and bureaucratic paralysis, the European Union is now forcing unwilling citizens to accept the arrival of millions of Syrian refugees. \u201cFar right\u201d can be confusing for Americans. It\u2019s not in the traditional American understanding of the left/liberal-right/conservative political spectrum. The European right tends to be fiscally liberal and in favor of activist government. Its defining issues have been about national sovereignty and immigration, which are issues about which American conservatives care, but formerly, many liberals did too. The idea of the American system in which there is basically a government party and an anti-government party seems just as odd to Europeans as the idea of a big-government right is to most Americans. But this is what happens to failing systems. And the Republican/Democrat duopoly has failed for sure. A secure border and functioning internal immigration controls are popular with voters of both parties. But to satisfy open-borders hardliners and to maintain the issue as a way to drive deeper the wedge between Hispanics and Republicans, Democrats have refused to act. Even to enforce existing laws. Even in the era of metastasizing Islamist militancy. Republicans, meanwhile, know that if they were to help President Obama to pass the tax overhaul he has long sought, it would be a boon to the economy and help kick off a period of economic growth. GOP leaders say they don\u2019t trust Obama enough to make a deal, but the truth is that it\u2019s that their voters who don\u2019t trust them. Any Republican caught negotiating with Obama on anything of substance would face total rebellion. In this fashion, America is evolving something more like a parliamentary system in which policy advances only occur when one party has total control of both governing branches. The problem is made worse here by the fact that those moments are harder to come by in a system of divided government. And when the tumblers all align, as they did in 2008, parties jam and cram through all of the measures their most ardent constituencies demand. The result is gridlock occasional punctuated by ideological veering and lurching and an increasingly frustrated electorate. No segment \u2013 left, right or center \u2013 gets what it wants and people increasingly lose faith in the system and its institutions. And that\u2019s the time when politicians like Trump can find purchase. If the current dysfunction becomes the norm for America, Trump will be just the first of many, increasingly successful candidates of the European mold. GRAHAM OUTNYT: \u201cSenator Lindsey Graham suspended his presidential campaign on Monday, saying that he has concluded \u201cthis is not my time\u201d despite making a difference in the race. The South Carolina Republican made the comments in a YouTube video. \u2018Since launching my campaign for president on June 1, I have offered a path to saving the American dream and working together on bold solutions to solve big problems,\u2019 said Mr. Graham, one of the most hawkish foreign policy voices in the race who has nonetheless been stuck in the low single digits in polls.\u201d 2016 GOP POWER INDEX:\u00a0JEB AGAIN?It\u2019s bad to be without a clear path to the nomination. But, as a political saying goes, it can be \u201cliberating.\u201d Like his stablemate John Kasich, Jeb Bush is devoting himself almost exclusively to hammering away at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Hitting the guy at the top of the polls has always been a good way for back-of-the-pack candidates to get attention. While that\u2019s true this time, there\u2019s the added motivation that Bush and others believe that if Trump is toppled, the race will be wholly remade. The last shall be made first, etc. Bush is succeeding with the former. By talking about Trump, Trump, Trump, Bush has gotten a boost in coverage from a Trumpcentric political press. And, Bush has seemed relieved to finally be able to say that he thinks Trump is \u201ca jerk.\u201d But will this help Bush more or Trump more? Given the fact that so few are willing to tackle Trump head-on and that Power Index frontrunner Ted Cruz is Trump\u2019s ablest enabler, Bush has little choice but to weaponize his candidacy. But at the same time, Bush is one of the least popular figures in his party and has always made the best foil for Trump. In the long run, a Bush resurgence most likely helps Trump. But in the short term, Bush is playing the card he has left. And given the devastating efficiency in which Cruz and Rubio are slashing each other to ribbons right now, every other non-Trump has a bit more reason to hope that the front of the pack might crack open. 1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Donald Trump; 4)\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0[+1]; 5)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[-1]; 6) Chris Christie On the radar -\u00a0Ben Carson,\u00a0John Kasich,\u00a0Rand Paul and\u00a0Mike Huckabee[Watch Fox: Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0joins \u201cThe Real Story with\u00a0Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.] What would you say? -\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

History.com: \u201cThe movie also made a star out of Benjamin Braddock\u2019s graduation present: a bright-red Alfa Romeo Duetto Spider. Alfa Romeo had been making racecars for decades\u2026But the 1967 Duetto Spider, a two-seat convertible roadster, was a real beauty: It had a sharp nose and a rounded, tapered rear end, glass-covered headlights, and what designers called a \u2018classic scallop\u2019 running down the side. It handled well, could go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 10 seconds, and got 23 miles per gallon of gas. Though the Duetto Spider was a great car and a pop-culture icon, Americans still weren\u2019t interested in buying it. The model\u2014with new names like the Spider Veloce, the Quadrifoglio and even the Graduate\u2014stayed on the market until 1994, without much sales success.\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Even if she\u2019s not lucky enough to draw him in a head-to-head matchup, Clinton will work to make her opponent little more than Trump-lite. That\u2019s what Justin Barasky of the Clinton-backing powerhouse super PAC Priorities USA sees ahead once she\u2019s head to head with the Republican nominee, whoever it may be. In the latest edition of Power Play, Barasky tells Chris Stirewalt that Republicans are \u201cpainting themselves\u201d as Trump-like and the result will be terrifying to key groups of the Obama coalition that Clinton is looking to reconstitute and ride to the White House. WATCH HERE. Tale of the tape - David Drucker says Dems aren\u2019t scared of Trump and the data backs them up: \u201cIn the latest\u00a0Fox News poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, Clinton was losing to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, 45 percent to 43 percent, and was tied with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, at 45 percent each. But she beat Trump like a drum, 49 percent to 38 percent, and came close to the important 50 percent mark\u2026 \u201cClinton beat Trump among women by 26 points and only trailed him by 5 points among men. She beat him among voters with college degrees and without; she demolished him with black voters and was only 5 points behind in the battle for whites. Clinton trailed Trump by a single point among independents. But she picked up 15 percent of Republicans, holding Trump to just 72 percent among voters in his own party.\u201d Clinton campaign fudges Trump in ISIS videos claim - Yahoo: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s communications director defended her candidate\u2019s claim that ISIS is using videos of Donald Trump\u00a0to recruit members, but could not point to specific evidence of this happening\u2026 \u2018She\u2019s not referring to a specific video, but he is being used in social media by ISIS as propaganda,\u2019 [Jennifer Palmieri told ABC News.]\u201d Debate not all roses for Hillary - Fox New contributor Doug Schoen called Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate \u201cHillary\u2019s night\u201d but also pointed to Clinton\u2019s vulnerability on foreign policy: \u201cMartin O\u2019Malley] noted how Ambassador Chris Stevens was not provided the proper support and tools to help Libya transition into a thriving democracy \u2013 a clear reminder of his untimely death. No doubt this foreshadows what will be in all likelihood a major line of attack from the Republicans and stands to really hurt her going forward.\u201d Obama blames media for stoking ISIS fears - The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama said in an [NPR] interview broadcast early Monday that he understands why Americans are worried about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), adding that it is important \u2018to keep things in perspective.\u2019 Obama blamed the media in part, for fears, saying that in the past month, \u2018all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you.\u2019\u201d ALWAYS SIGNAL BEFORE EXECUTING YOUR TURNThe Telegraph: \u201cThe government in the Netherlands has clarified that it is legal for driving instructors to offer lessons in return for sex, as long as the students are over the age of 18. However, it is illegal to offer sex in return for lessons. Transport minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen and Justice minister Ard van der Steur addressed the issue in response to a question tabled in parliament by Gert-Jan Segers of the socially conservative Christian Union party, noting that, although 'undesirable', offering driving lessons with sex as payment is not illegal. In a letter to parliament the ministers said: \u2018It\u2019s not about offering sexual activities for remuneration, but offering a driving lesson. It is important that the initiative lies with the driving instructor, and focuses on offering a driving lesson, with the payment provided in sexual acts. When a sexual act offered in lieu of financial payment, that is prostitution.\u2019\u201d Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "FILE - July 28, 2016: Khizr Khan, father of fallen US Army Capt. Humayun S. M. Khan and his wife Ghazala speak during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on the website US Defense Watch. It is reprinted with permission. Dear Mr. Khan, I, like millions of Americans saw your speech at the DNC on Thursday night. I wish to offer my sympathy for the death of your son, Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq. As a former US Army officer, and a veteran of the Gulf War, I can certainly understand the pain and anguish that you and your wife endure every day. Your son died saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. As Jesus told his disciples, according to the Gospel of John, Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Captain Khan is a hero. I am sure the soldiers he served with regard him as one. I know you and your wife do. Rest assured that millions of veterans regard your son as a hero as well. To paraphrase from the Book of Ecclesiasticus, your son\u2019s name liveth for evermore. Your son made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, a country that was new to you and your family and one which you openly embraced and certainly love. When you and your family arrived to America from Pakistan, you assimilated into our country. You adopted American ways, learned our history and apparently you even acquired a pocket Constitution along the way. Good for you sir. But, there are many Muslims in America who not only have no desire to assimilate, but wish to live under Sharia Law. That is unacceptable to Americans. There is only one law of the land. That is the U.S. Constitution. As you well know, Mr. Khan, we live in violent times, dangerous times. Muslim madmen from ISIS and other radical Jihadi groups are on a murder and terror spree across the globe. Your religion of peace, Islam, is anything but that in 2016. That is a fact that is confirmed every time a Muslim shoots, bombs, beheads and tortures innocent men, women and children. This does not mean that every Muslim is a terrorist, but most terrorists, sir, are indeed Muslims. A Muslim terrorist attack has become the sign of the times. Regardless of what the feckless, na\u00efve, leftist ideologue Barack Obama and his dimwitted colleagues John Kerry, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel state, the United States and the West are at war with Radical Islam. It is the job of the president of the United States to protect his nation from all enemies; foreign and domestic. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama romanticizes Islam and refuses to accept reality, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people across the world. Groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda have one goal, the complete destruction of the Judeo-Christian culture, our religions and our way of life. Many Americans have families that have been here for decades, even centuries. Many families like mine have relatives who fought in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm. Some families have relatives who fought in the American Revolution. We don\u2019t plan on letting our country be devoured by Muslim maniacs. We are Americans sir, and not unarmed, socialist European zombies. We will do what is necessary to protect the United States. While many Democrats and liberals see the world through rose colored glasses, conservatives understand that there is good and evil in this world. Evil must be destroyed before it destroys us. Strong measures, wartime measures, must be taken to protect this country from those that wish to annihilate us and our way of life. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to temporarily halt immigration from Muslim countries that are known to either support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups is not only pragmatic, but indeed it is constitutional. It is the constitutional duty of the president of the United States to protect this nation. There is simply no way to vet hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from war zones like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Europe is being destroyed because reckless leaders like Angela Merkel have opened the continent\u2019s doors to a flood of over one million undocumented Muslims arriving with nothing more than a bad attitude and a haversack of Jihad. Do you think Americans are stupid? While the left lives in a dream world, the right does not. Mr. Trump understands the threat to his nation and the threat, sir, is not from Swedish Lutherans named Anna and Lars. The threat, sir, is from radical Islam. How in God\u2019s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of a 22-year-old Syrian man? It is impossible. You know it is impossible. How in God\u2019s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and thousands of other sundry Muslims who wish to arrive on our shores? It is impossible. You know it is impossible. Whether you, your wife, the Muslim world and millions of Democrats are offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s realistic view of the world is irrelevant. Whether you, your wife and son would have been prohibited from emigrating from Pakistan to America under Mr. Trump\u2019s wartime plan is irrelevant. The security of this great land supersedes your desires and the desires of others who wish to come here now. The United States of America has no obligation to open its doors in order to placate foreigners and liberals in our government. To adopt any other course but Mr. Trump\u2019s would be a cause for further endangering the lives of Americans every day. That, sir, is unacceptable. You attacked Mr. Trump in front of a worldwide audience, yet you can\u2019t understand the fact that he defends himself against attacks from you, Hillary Clinton and the left. What else is one to do sir? We must live in a world of reality, not a world of denial, delusion and fantasy the Democrats inhabit every waking day of their lives. Radical Islam is the enemy of everyone on this planet who believes in freedom and justice. Until it is destroyed, this nation must protect itself from enemies both foreign and domestic.

            "article_content": "Recording from 2005 surfaces A leaked video from 2005 captured Donald Trump using lewd language discussing women with a television host just before he made a cameo appearance on a soap opera. On the tape, Trump bragged about kissing and groping women while chatting with \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush.\u00a0The real estate developer and reality TV star-turned-GOP presidential candidate also used a vulgar anatomical term and discussed trying to have sex with an unidentified, married woman. \"I moved on her and I failed,\" Trump says. \"I\u2019ll admit it ... She was married ... And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll show you where they have some nice furniture.\u2019\" \"I\u2019ve gotta use some tic tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump says after seeing the actress Arianne Zucker on the set of the soap opera on which he was to appear. \"You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\" \"And when you're a star they let you do it,\" Trump continued. \"You can do anything.\" Trump subsequently issued an apology that simultaneously took aim at his rival's husband. \"This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago,\" Trump said. \"Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.\" The remarks were met with widespread condemnation. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus immediately issued a statement saying, \"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was \"beside himself\" and Pence's wife was furious, a person familiar with their thinking told the Associated Press.\u00a0In public, Pence ignored questions shouted by reporters in Rossford, Ohio, where he was campaigning with his daughter. This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.\u00a0https://t.co/RwhW7yeFI2 This kind of behavior is disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach.\u00a0https://t.co/mOUKgr6axl House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., with whom Trump was supposed to appear at an event in the Badger State Saturday, said in a statement that he was \"sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified.\" Ryan's statement added that \"[Trump] is no longer attending tomorrow's event in Wisconsin.\" Sources told Fox News that Ryan had revoked Trump's invitation to the event. Trump issued a second statement late Friday saying that Pence would attend the Wisconsin event in Trump's place, while the nominee would stay in New York to prep for Sunday's debate. The Washington Post and NBC News obtained the tape,\u00a0which includes audio and some video, and released it Friday afternoon. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is locked in a tough re-election fight and this week reversed herself to say Trump was not a good role model for children, said his comments \"are totally inappropriate and offensive.\" The comments emerged two days before the Republican nominee meets Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for their second presidential debate, and as he confronts a series of past stories about his comments about women and tries to move beyond remarks shaming a former Miss Universe for gaining weight. Trump was talking with Bush moments before they arrived on the set of \"Days of Our Lives\" to tape a segment about Trump\u2019s upcoming cameo on the soap opera, according to the Post. As the bus rolls to a stop, Trump and Bush, apparently looking out at the waiting Zucker, can be heard ogling her. \"Your girl\u2019s hot as s---, in the purple,\" says Bush, who\u2019s now a co-host of NBC\u2019s \"Today\" show. \"Whoa!\" Trump says. \"Whoa!\" In his own statement, Billy Bush said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed.\" \"It's no excuse, but this happened 11 years ago,\" said Bush. \"I was younger, less mature and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\" Earlier this week, Trump dismissed questions about his history of vulgarity, telling a television station in Nevada that \"a lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment.\" He added: \"And I can tell you this, there's nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 that has more respect for women than I do.\" Trump is slated to travel Saturday to Wisconsin to campaign at an event with House Speaker Paul Ryan, in what would be their first joint campaign appearance. Several aides to Ryan did not respond to inquiries about whether the Wisconsin Republican still planned to appear with the nominee. Trump has a long reported history of making lewd and highly sexual comments toward and about women. The Associated Press reported this week that during his years as a reality TV star on the \"The Apprentice,\" the GOP nominee repeatedly demeaned women with sexist language, rating female contestants by the size of their breasts and talking about which ones he'd like to have sex with. During frequent interviews with shock jock Howard Stern in the 1990s, Trump made a long list of demeaning comments, saying that he could have had sex with Diana, Princess of Wales, who had recently been killed in a car crash, and declaring that \"A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.\" He has repeatedly called the comedian Rosie O'Donnell a \"pig\" and \"slob\" and suggested she'd be less depressed if she stopped looking in the mirror. The Los Angeles Times reported last month that managers at Trump's golf club in southern California knew the New York developer only wanted good-looking women on staff. Trump also bragged in the moments after the first debate and days afterward that he had decided not to bring up Bill Clinton' infidelities, even as he did so. But Thursday night in New Hampshire, Trump said at an event \"let's see what happens\" when asked if he might do so in Sunday's second debate. FoxNews.com's Blanche Johnson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In this photo provided by the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), former Washington congressional delegate Walter Fauntroy is shown. (Customs and Border Patrol via AP) WASHINGTON  \u2013 Civil rights leader and former congressional delegate Walter Fauntroy was arrested Monday at Dulles International Airport on a 5-year-old charge of writing a bad check in Maryland, authorities said. Fauntroy, 83, had been living abroad for the past four years, and relatives and friends had expressed concerns about his health. He told The Washington Post in a telephone interview last week that he was coming home and that he believed the bad-check issue was resolved. Fauntroy was arrested Monday morning upon his arrival on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on charges of fraud and failure to appear in court, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. He was booked and will be arraigned Tuesday. A retired Baptist minister, Fauntroy helped plan the 1963 March on Washington with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a close friend. He served for 20 years as the District of Columbia's first elected delegate to Congress. The city's delegate can vote in committees but not on the House floor. He stepped down to run for mayor in 1990 but lost that election. Attorney Arthur Reynolds, who is representing Fauntroy in the bad-check case, said Monday that he had not yet spoken to Fauntroy and could not comment on the case, which relates to a $55,000 check Fauntroy wrote to help pay for a 2009 ball he organized for President Barack Obama's first inauguration. Reynolds has said previously that Fauntroy had paid back some, but not all, of the $55,000. Fauntroy left for the UAE in early 2012 after a bench warrant was issued for him in Prince George's County, Maryland, to answer charges in the case. Fauntroy told The Post in the interview last week, his first since moving abroad, that he had been homeless for brief stretches during his stay in the UAE and that he lived for months at a time with families he befriended there. He said he was working on green-energy projects. His longtime personal attorney, Johnny Barnes, did not immediately return a telephone message from The Associated Press on Monday. However, Barnes told The Post that Fauntroy was \"disappointed\" by the arrest but that overall, he seemed \"much improved and in good spirits.\"",

REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlin    (UNITED STATES - Tags: SOCIETY POLITICS) - RTR3FDZD **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Dems veer into danger zone with abortion bill \u2022 Bipartisan bill to speed deportations gains ground \u2022 Conservative group targets Christie\u2019s judgment on judges \u2022 Braley does the chicken dance \u2022 D.C. stands for \u2018doesn\u2019t count\u2019 DEMS VEER INTO DANGER ZONE WITH ABORTION BILLDemocrats today are kicking up their election-year effort to shift the discussion to social issues in a bid to drive a wedge between female voters and the GOP. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is leading a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today on his bill that would override the laws banning late-term abortions and imposing regulations on abortion clinics in an increasing number of states. The bill, which already has the support of nearly two-thirds of Senate Democrats, would eradicate the restrictions in at least a dozen states where abortions have been banned after the start of the sixth month of pregnancy and rules in many more states that regulate the conditions at abortion clinics. The New York Times editorial board is enthused as are others on the left who have seen access to elective abortions restricted in the aftermath of the discovery of a house of horrors at the Philadelphia abortion clinic operated by Dr. Kermit Gosnell. But Blumenthal\u2019s anti-anti-Gosnell bill takes Democrats into some very dangerous political territory.Trickier topic - The Democrats\u2019 gynecological approach worked twice before to save the Senate, thanks in part to some self-destructive Republican candidates \u2013 most notably former Rep. Todd Akin (who still is out there trying and failing to explain his unorthodox understanding of biology). Having so recently been on these crusades, Democrats still have the battle plan handy and are quick to race into the fray. The fundraising emails were out on the Hobby Lobby case even before reporters had finished reading the opinion and the legislation from vulnerable Senate Democrats was out soon thereafter. But fighting state abortion regulations is something very different than just punking Akin or thinking up some new birth-control hashtags. Americans got comfortable talking about \u201cthe pill\u201d a long time ago, but still find it kind of fun and sexy. Abortion, though, is still a raw subject and demands delicate discussion. It\u2019s a topic around which error-prone politicians ought not tread. The majority of Americans favor restrictions on abortion, leaving the Democratic default position on the issue \u2013 unrestricted access to elective abortion \u2013\u00a0 increasingly out of step. It\u2019s great to say you think ladies ought to be able to get the pill, a largely uncontroversial position for 40 years. But how about sharing your view on when life begins? Or whether unborn children feel pain? Where\u2019s your hashtag for those?Shetlands, sheepdogs - So while today\u2019s Blumenthal hearing certainly is part of Democratic efforts to shift the election narrative and to frighten suburban women about Akin-ite boogeymen lurking in every doctor\u2019s office, it\u2019s also evidence of the power of the left wing in the Democratic Party. One would have to imagine this hearing is designed to placate the vocal, well-funded pro-choice crusaders in the Democratic base and not designed to proceed even to a show vote. After all, the most influential pro-choice political group doesn\u2019t even talk about the issue in its ads, instead attacking Republicans on unrelated topics. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a self-professed pro-life Mormon, knows the power of the issue in swing states like his own. Surely he intends to squelch the subject and get back to regular programming as soon as the hearing wraps. If he doesn\u2019t, Democrats from red states will start having to answer whether they would support rolling back restrictions.Right back at you - Republican strategist Lauren Zelt suggests a different way for her party to counter Democratic gender warfare: turn the beat around. From her column in The Hill: \u201cWhat's our answer to the grammatically questionable #notmybossbusiness? It doesn't lie solely in carefully debunking the Democrats' argument. It's a tedious process, and it doesn't make for a good hashtag, sound bite or campaign ad. A better strategy could be to point out the obvious: In 2014, the Democratic Party is the party defining women solely by their reproductive organs. When did it become socially acceptable again to define women that way? When did we travel back to 1955?\u201d [ObamaCare decision as early as today - A decision could come as early as today in the lawsuit that would end ObamaCare\u2019s insurance subsidies in more states who did not set up their own state exchange. If the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rules in favor to the suit, more than half of the country would lose insurance subsidies in President Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Regardless of the decision, it is likely to appealed to the Supreme Court.]BIPARTISAN BILL TO SPEED UP DEPORTATIONS GAINS GROUNDWaPo: \u201cA pair of lawmakers from Texas will introduce bipartisan legislation in Congress on [today] to speed up the deportations of tens of thousands of Central American children who have entered the country illegally across the southern border. Sen. John Cornyn (R) and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D) say their bill aims to amend a 2008 law that currently requires the federal government to provide greater legal protections to young immigrants who attempt to enter the United States from noncontiguous countries. The legislation would rewrite the law to allow Central American minors be treated like those from Mexico and Canada, who can be deported more quickly. Under the plan, unaccompanied minors from any country would be able to have an immigration court hearing within seven days of their processing by Health and Human Services, and an immigration judge would be required to rule within three more days on whether the child would be allowed to stay or be deported. The bill authorizes 40 new immigration judges to help process the cases. The lawmakers are calling their bill the HUMANE Act, an acronym for: Helping Unaccompanied Minors and Alleviating National Emergency.\u201d [What\u2019s the president doing today? Oh, you know, a photo-op to draw attention to a political issue. It is almost as if he believes political \u201ctheater\u201d can help solve problems.]Poll: 6 out of 10 disapprove of Obama\u2019s handling of border crisis - Fifty-eight percent of American adults disapprove of the way President Obama is handling the immigration crisis, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. While Republicans in Congress are still trying to piece together their response to Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion request to aid the influx of Central American children at the border, slightly more adults, 66 percent, disapprove of the GOP\u2019s lack of action. But there is hope for the President, a majority of respondents support the nearly $4 billion plan that will provide care for the illegal children while waiting their deportation hearings, speed up the hearing process and increase border security.Asylum approvals skyrocket under Obama - Daily Caller: \u201cThe number of foreigners who successfully filed asylum claims in the United States almost tripled from 2012 to 2013, up to 30,393. That\u2019s 10 times the number from 2008, when President Barack Obama was elected, and it is evidence his immigration officials are approving most of the asylum requests from the growing wave of Central American migrants. If you came illegally to the U.S. seeking asylum in 2013, you had better than a four-in-five chance of successfully filing an asylum claim. That\u2019s up from a three-in-five chance in 2008. The migrants include mothers with children, and youths who have been brought north by their parents who are living illegally in the United States. Roughly 240,000 migrants \u2014 parents, youths and children \u2014 are expected to cross the border by the end of September. The total includes 57,525 unaccompanied youths and children, from October 2013 to June 30, 2014, according to DHS.\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...With the so-called \u201csummer polar vortex\u201d around the corner, it may seem shocking that 55 million years ago, researchers believe it was a \u201csteamy, runaway greenhouse world\u201d with no polar ice caps.

During an interview with Cheney and members of his family, Politico\u2019s Mike Allen mentioned Megyn\u2019s \u201ctough questions\u201d saying that she was \u201cno enemy\u201d to suggest that Cheney was having trouble even in presumably friendly precincts. Megyn offered some helpful guidance for her press critics: \u201cMike Allen\u2019s right, I\u2019m not an enemy of Vice President Cheney. I\u2019m not a friend of Vice President Cheney. I\u2019m a journalist who asks questions and he\u2019s a politician who had the guts to come in here and answer them. And let me tell you something else, unlike a lot of politicians and pundits who come in here and answer tough questions, the Cheneys never complained. In fact, they thanked us for the interview and we thank them for being standup people in coming on and giving it.\u201dD.C. STANDS FOR \u2018DOESN\u2019T COUNT\u2019 Justin Gray, the Washington correspondent for Central Florida\u2019s WSTV, thought it was a fairly average day when he arrived to the Orlando airport. He had his bags packed and his District of Columbia-issued driver\u2019s license in hand. But when an Orlando Transportation Safety Administration agent looked at his driver\u2019s license, he insisted to Gray the license was not valid, according to WSTV. Gray said it was his legal, up-to-date identification from the D.C. government, but the agent said he didn\u2019t recognize the license. After a brief back and forth, Gray said he realized that the agent didn\u2019t know what the District of Columbia was. After much discussion, Gray was finally able to go through security. Soon after the discrepancy, a TSA spokesman contacted Gray to confirm the District of Columbia\u2019s license is an acceptable form of ID and that all the TSA agents in Orlando will be shown a copy of the D.C. driver\u2019s license.AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cIf you treat them here as refugees, you\u2019re essentially saying everybody who wants can come in. \u2026 The idea that you\u2019re importing the problem into the U.S. to me is unacceptable because in the end it means we don\u2019t have a border.\u201d \u2013Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

The pauses painful and potent. #AndWhatisAleppo?  It\u2019s a very good question. A question that prompts the squirming. It is one we must answer. It is Sarajevo, it is Bosnia, it is a village in Rwanda. It\u2019s a place we thought would go away. It is somebody\u2019s home.

Barrel bombs are improvised devices in round metal containers, containing explosives, shrapnel and sometimes chemicals.\u00a0 They are crude larger IEDs, dropping from the sky, and targeting anything \u00a0unlucky enough to be in the path.\u00a0 Tens of thousands of children have been slaughtered in Syria according to the U.N., so Omran was lucky to survive.\u00a0 Over eight million children have been affected by the conflict. Many have nowhere to go, nowhere to live and if they are five or under like Omran, war is \u00a0all they\u2019ve ever known. Remember \u00a0#AssadMustGo? Back on Sep 6, 2013,\u00a0President Obama said this. \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus.\u201d The line was crossed, and the only calculus that changed was Assad\u2019s.\u00a0 It became clear he could defend his Alawite minority dictatorship and for now, no one was going to stop him. The world stood back as Vladimir Putin helped him crush the \u2018rebels.\u2019 Threatened with death, the refugee crisis began. Millions and millions of people flooded out of Syria.\u00a0Like their beleaguered neighbors in Iraq and Libya many fled to Europe. Now our allies there are overburdened and scared that -- among those who ran -- are people who want to (and do) cause them harm. There is a battle here at home about how many more refugees we should let into our country as well.\u00a0The compassionate argument is that we must help, but it is also appropriate to ask where was the compassion in 2013, when the \u201credline\u201d was crossed?\u00a0 These people wanted to live their lives and raise their families in their hometowns, but they could not. \u00a0In places like #AndWhatisAleppo, those who stayed are under siege. #AndWhatisAleppo? \u00a0It\u2019s a very good question. A question that prompts the squirming. It is one we must answer. It is Sarajevo, it is Bosnia, it is a village in Rwanda. It\u2019s a place we thought would go away. It is somebody\u2019s home. By late Thursday morning, after his interview, Gary Johnson had issued a statement. It said in part: \"\u2026 hit with 'What about Aleppo?' I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked. It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign \u2026 Can I name every city in Syria? No. Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes.\" Johnson also admitted he needs to study more and gain a better understanding.\u00a0 Perhaps he\u2019s not alone.",

            "article_content": "Nov. 9, 2015: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to a crowd of supporters during a campaign rally in Springfield, Ill. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman) SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2013 Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is suggesting boycotting Starbucks over the minimalist design of its annual holiday cups. \"Did you read about Starbucks? No more Merry Christmas on Starbucks,\" Trump told a capacity crowd of thousands gathered to hear him speak at a pre-debate rally in Springfield, Illinois on Monday evening. \"Maybe we should boycott Starbucks. I don't know,\" he said. \"Seriously, I don't care.\" Some religious conservatives have expressed anger over the coffee company's annual holiday-time cups \u2014 a minimalist all-red design with no images aside from the company's green and white logo. Previous years' cups have featured snowflakes, winter scenes and sometimes Christmas ornaments. But a small number of critics see the design choice as part of a larger movement away from exclusively Christian-themed holiday decorations. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump, who is working to win the support of evangelical and other conservative Christians in a crowded field, has often expressed frustrations over companies using the term \"Happy Holidays\" in place of \"Merry Christmas.\" He said on Monday that: \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying, 'Merry Christmas' again. That I can tell you.\" He added that Starbucks operates a store in one of his buildings and that \"that's the end of that lease, but who cares?\" The rally comes on the eve of the next Republican presidential debate, which will be taking place Tuesday evening in Milwaukee. Brian Oaks, general manager of the Prairie Capital Convention Center, said the billionaire businessman and reality television star had attracted a record-setting crowd for the convention center of 10,200 in downtown Springfield, a solidly Republican city in a Democratic-leaning state. Trump did not mention the debate during his rally speech, but previewed some of the attack lines he may choose to use against rivals, including retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is now running neck-and-neck with him in several polls. Trump expressed near-exasperation at Carson's continued popularity in the face of growing questions about discrepancies in his autobiography, \"Gifted Hands,\" which included claims that he tried to hit his mother with a hammer and unsuccessfully tried to stab someone when he was an angry youth. \"With what's going on with this election? I've never seen anything like it,\" said Trump. He went on to mimic the back-and-forth between Carson and reporters trying to verify the story of his rise from poverty to acclaimed surgeon, including a claim by Carson that the person he'd tried to stab had been saved by his belt buckle. \"You stab somebody and the newspapers say, 'You didn't do it.' And you said, 'Yes I did, I did it!'\" said Trump. \"This is the only election in history where you're better off if you stabbed somebody,\" he said. \"What are we coming to?\"",

Louisiana\u0092s deep, persistent budget troubles are endangering the future of medical training programs. Proposed cuts to hospitals could damage the stream of new doctors for a generation, in a state that has chronic shortages of health care workers and some of the worst health care outcomes in the nation.  (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) Immigration has been much in the news lately, with the Supreme Court deadlock blocking President Obama\u2019s immigration reform program, California\u2019s move to try to extend participation in their state health exchange to undocumented immigrants, and the continuing prominence of immigration as both a presidential election issue and a source of international turmoil. One aspect often lost in the headlines is just how challenging it can be for immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to get health insurance in the United States. The complexity of the nation\u2019s health care system can be daunting for consumers in general. The complexity is magnified for immigrants\u2014many of whom have difficulty communicating in English, work for low wages at jobs that do not offer health coverage and may face a welter of legal obstacles to acquire it on their own. As a neutral, independent nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing transparency to healthcare costs and health insurance information, FAIR Health takes no position on immigration issues. We do, however, try to demystify health insurance for everyone, including immigrants. For that reason, we prepared a new segment (available in both English and Spanish) in our ongoing series of FH\u00ae Health Insurance 101 articles called, \u201cImmigration and Health Insurance Coverage: What Are Your Options?\u201d The FH Health Insurance 101 series explains our health insurance system to consumers in a way that is both useful and easy to understand. Our new immigration article presents a map for immigrants of the challenging pathway to getting covered. For immigrants lucky enough to be covered by their employer\u2019s health plan, getting insured is relatively easy. For those who can afford to buy health insurance directly from an insurer or broker, it is also fairly simple. For others, it may be complicated or impossible. Consider first the documented immigrants\u2014those who are US citizens or, in the federal government\u2019s terminology, are \u201clawfully present.\u201d Those include green card holders (lawful permanent residents), people who have been granted asylum (asylees), refugees and other individuals on a long list of immigration statuses. Those immigrants, like most other Americans, are required to have health insurance or pay a penalty on their taxes. They can buy coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act, but they have to prove their immigration status with highly technical documentation. Depending on factors such as income, US citizens and immigrants considered \u201cqualified non-citizens\u201d may be eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). But, many qualified non-citizens have to wait five years after getting their qualified immigration status before they can get Medicaid or CHIP. As for Medicare, immigrants turning 65 have to have been lawfully present for at least five years to be eligible. Now consider the country\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. They are not allowed to use the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicare, or, in many states, Medicaid or CHIP. (An exception is made for emergencies, for which even undocumented immigrants may be eligible for emergency Medicaid benefits.) Rules about Medicaid and CHIP differ from state to state, and in some states and cities some undocumented immigrants may be eligible for some kind of public health insurance. But finding out the details in their particular location can be difficult\u2014especially since undocumented immigrants often are wary of approaching any government agency, for fear that reporting their status will get them deported. To complicate matters, immigrant families often include members with different immigration statuses. An undocumented mother may have a child who is a U.S. citizen. The mother in such a case can apply to the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid or CHIP for coverage just for the child, without having to disclose her own immigration status. In practice, however, children born in the United States to undocumented parents are three times more likely to be uninsured than other US-born children. Because undocumented immigrants face such obstacles in obtaining health insurance, they often avoid going to the doctor, and may end up costing taxpayers more when conditions that could have been prevented or treated early become expensive emergency cases. Those without health insurance often depend on a \u201csafety net\u201d of free or low-cost care at Federally Qualified Health Centers, migrant health centers and public and nonprofit hospitals. FAIR Health does not advocate any particular policy. But we hope that presenting the facts about immigrants and health insurance will help individuals concerned about insurance and their access to care and will contribute to a better informed and healthier population.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama speaks about the massacre at a nightclub in Orlando that claimed 50 lives during a news conference at the White House in Washington, Sunday, June 12, 2016. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press Wash DC) The massacre in Orlando by a self-proclaimed Islamist terrorist removes any doubt that the West or its allies have contained the radical jihadi movement. You wouldn\u2019t know it by listening to President Obama. From the Oval Office on Monday, he remained unable to utter the words \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Yet, early Sunday morning the shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS and reportedly yelled \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d before opening fire. He murdered and injured more than 100 innocents in the worst Islamic terror assault on U.S. soil since 9/11. Family and friends are suffering. Their lives will never be the same. The worst aspect is that political leadership could have helped to prevent the attack by addressing the violent Islamist threat by its rightful nature. As was the case in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino or any of the other murders in the name of Allah against the West the during his time in office, the president will not identify \u201cjihad\u201d as even a possible motivation. He instead talks about gun control, identity politics and thought crimes. Americans know that it was terror. They know that it was hate. They also know that is so much more than that. For weeks ISIS has threatened brutal attacks throughout the world during the month of Ramadan. The Investigative Project on Terrorism has tracked the threat streams along with the intelligence community. What were suspect Omar Mateen\u2019s interactions with various groups in the U.S. and internationally? Who were the groups, and what was the nature of those interactions? Law enforcement officials had Mateen on their radar. Why did they stop monitoring him? Could it have had anything to do with the suffocating political correctness \u2013 in which \u201cworkplace violence\u201d and \u201cman-caused disasters\u201d replaced jihadist terror \u2013 over the last few years? The echo chamber of Islamist front organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Muslim American Society and the Muslim Public Affairs Council facilitate the administration\u2019s obfuscation. They rush to condemn the attacks to American audiences, yet they are the worst enablers of the attacks themselves. CAIR, for example, routinely pressures American Muslims to not cooperate with law enforcement. White House records reveals that leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood regularly meet with officials at the highest levels of government to influence stewards of foreign policy into minimizing the threat from Islamic terror organizations. The president may only have seven more months in office, but he needs to provide the country with a new strategy. It cannot continue down the same path of political correctness, and it cannot wait until a new president assumes office to reevaluate. The evidence of the West losing the struggle is overwhelming. Globally, the number of victims has increased to unprecedented levels. Millions of refugees flood Europe from the Middle East and Africa, Islamists behead and inflict genocide against religious minorities and ISIS has created a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, as well as in Libya. Orlando is such a painful illustration that the U.S. is not beyond its reach. American leadership needs to engage in a frank discussion about where we go from here. It needs to identify and implement a policy against jihadist terror that transcends elections, including the upcoming November ballot. It can no longer punt on the issue and hope that nothing bad happens under its watch. Discerning the threat is not difficult. Identifying its true nature seems impossible to current leaders. Developing effective counter strategies is no easy task, but it needs to start today. Americans will not tolerate any more carnage. Obama said in his remarks to the nation today that the attack in Orlando could have occurred in any U.S. community. He needs to finally understand that there is something dreadfully wrong with that.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Congressional Democrats are trying to build support for an effort to bar gun purchases by terror suspects, hoping to take advantage of the same public anxieties about security that gave Republicans a ringing House victory. The Democratic push seems likely to fall victim to opposition from the National Rifle Association and congressional gun-rights backers, chiefly Republicans, who have smothered firearms curbs for years. If the Republicans who control Congress block votes on the proposal, Democrats hope to profit politically by winning sympathy from angry voters. \"By leaving this terrorist loophole open, Republicans are leaving every community in America vulnerable to attacks by terrorists armed with assault rifles and explosives purchased legally, in broad daylight,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Friday in a written statement. The bill by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., would have the attorney general compile names of known and suspected terrorists, likely drawing from huge lists the government already keeps. Federally licensed gun dealers would be barred from selling firearms to people on that list if government officials believed they planned to use the weapons for terrorism. Gun dealers are prohibited from selling to 10 categories of people, including many convicted criminals or those with severe mentally illness. But people appearing on the government's terror watch lists \u2014 including those kept off from airlines \u2014 are not automatically disqualified from buying weapons from gun dealers. The FBI is notified when a background check for the purchase of firearms or explosives generates a match with the watch list, and agents often use that information to step up surveillance on suspects. By law, people can try persuading the Justice Department to remove their names from terror lists or can file lawsuits challenging their inclusion. The lists are overwhelmingly composed of foreigners. Between 2004 and 2014, people on one terror watch list underwent background checks to buy guns 2,233 times and were allowed to make the purchase 91 percent of the time, according to a March report by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative agency of Congress. NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker noted that there have been numerous instances of innocent people mistakenly added to terror lists. She also accused Democrats of trying to take advantage of heightened public alarm following last week's attacks in Paris, which claimed at least 130 lives and for which the Islamic State, which has also threatened the U.S., has claimed responsibility. \"It is appalling that anti-gun politicians are exploiting the Paris terrorist attacks to push their gun-control agenda and distract from President Obama's failed foreign policy,\" Baker said. Feinstein's measure echoes legislation that the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., proposed repeatedly over the last decade and that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., has long pushed. None of those measures has ever received a vote. Feinstein introduced her bill in February. But last week's mass killings in Paris have injected new life into terrorism and public safety as top-tier political issues. Just Thursday, Republicans took advantage of voters' security jitters and muscled legislation through the House preventing Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the U.S. until the administration tightens restrictions on their entry. Forty-seven Democrats voted for the bill, ignoring a veto threat by President Barack Obama, who said the current screening system is strong and accused Republicans of playing on panicked voters. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., did not respond directly when asked Thursday if he favored barring people on terror lists from buying guns. \"We are just beginning this process of reassessing all of our security stances,\" he said. Donald Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said McConnell has not said whether he would be open to a vote on Feinstein's bill. But opposition from Republicans and some Democrats to curbing firearms runs deep, and such legislation would require support from 60 of the 100 senators. Democrats could not attain that margin even when they had a Senate majority in the months after the 2012 massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut. Though the Senate had showdown votes on gun curbs in early 2013, it did not revisit the issue as the 2014 elections approached and Reid opted to protect vulnerable Democrats from potentially angering constituents. The GOP-run House has held no votes on major gun control measures since the Newtown killings. Feinstein's bill isn't the only gun-related measure Democrats may pursue. A measure by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would bar gun sales to foreigners in the U.S. from the 38 countries from which visitors need not have visas.",

Nguyen and his family moved to Philadelphia from Vietnam more than 20 years ago and was welcomed and helped by the local Catholic church. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (The Associated Press) PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Ly Nguyen and his family knew little about Philadelphia when they moved here from Vietnam more than 20 years ago, but they knew where to turn for help \u2014 the Roman Catholic Church. Their parish priest helped teach Nguyen's six children English. He provided food, clothing, even cash. When the plumbing in their home went bad, the priest found a repairman. When the summer heat became too much, he bought them an air conditioner. \"He opened his arms to welcome our family,\" said Nguyen, 72, who was born Catholic, through a translator. \"Life here has been good. We have work to do, we have friends and we go to church.\" When Pope Francis visits Philadelphia in September, after stops in Washington and New York, the crowd that gathers to hear the papal Mass will look different from the one that greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. The Catholic population has been buoyed by new immigrants, including from Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam. From a single Vietnamese community in a single parish when John Paul visited, the archdiocese is now home to a Vietnamese Catholic community numbering 10,000 scattered across eight parishes, with eight scheduled Masses in Vietnamese. They intend to welcome the pope with the same warmth they received from his church when they came here first as refugees following the fall of Saigon 40 years ago this month, and later for family reunification. The excitement is palpable. They're raising funds to help those still in Southeast Asia get to Philadelphia. They're offering up their homes to house both friends and strangers. They're planning to repair and clean a convent \u2014 once home to 30 nuns, now home to three \u2014 so nuns from Vietnam can stay there. They're also preparing to buy lunch for the thousands expected to attend one of their own Masses. \"We have to buy hoagies for 3,000!\" said Monsignor Joseph Trinh, a Vietnamese-born pastor at St. Helena Church and a community leader. Those comfortable speaking English are also preparing for endless hours of translations and assistance. And yet they could not be happier. \"The church in Philadelphia has been very good to us,\" Trinh said. \"There's something unique about Vietnamese Catholics. The church is the center of their lives. ... They would pay more to buy a house near a church. They send their children to Catholic schools. They are willing to sacrifice for their children and their church.\" When the Vietnamese came to Philadelphia, that they would live near churches was inevitable in a city thick with holy places. That the clergy there of all nationalities would provide financial and spiritual support was a welcome bonus. Some new arrivals were among those who already followed the faith. Roman Catholics today constitute about 7 percent of Vietnam's population, with their numbers growing, though the Vatican does not have diplomatic relations with the communist country. Others joined the faith later. Nghia Hang, 63, arrived as a Buddhist but was drawn to Catholicism after a priest joined him in praying for his ailing teenage daughter \u2014 and she recovered. He was baptized and is now a church leader. Then there are the converts who have found a community within the church. On April 4, Trinh baptized Thuong Dinh, her husband and her two daughters. For years, her husband had encouraged her to convert. Speaking through a translator, Dinh said she agreed to be baptized because she wanted the whole family to be together on something so big. \"We have been received ... with open arms from not only the people, the priests and the bishops,\" Trinh said. \"So it's our turn to pass on the faith to our next generations.\" Today, there are about 1.3 million Vietnamese immigrants in the U.S. Most have settled in warmer climates, making Los Angeles, San Jose, Houston and New Orleans popular options. Philadelphia's Vietnamese community of about 30,000 ranks 10th among U.S. cities, said Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute. Early immigrants came as refugees seeking humanitarian shelter. Today, 95 percent are here because of family reunification, Batalova said. Ly Nguyen, the Catholic father of six who came to the U.S. in the 1990s, was an Army major working with the Americans during the Vietnam War. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for seven years. When he was released, he became a farmer. He came to America, he said, as a result of an agreement between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments that opened the door for former Army officers to emigrate. Nguyen worked in a nail salon when he arrived. His two adult sons are now machinists. Two daughters work in nail salons, and a third at a hospital. But all of the children live nearby. Five are married. Nguyen and his wife, Nu Le, have nine grandchildren. The family gathers most Sundays at church. They celebrated Easter together, sharing a feast that included roast pork and vermicelli, chicken curry, and a dish made with goat. For special occasions, \"there is more food, more happy,\" Nguyen laughed. \"They all stay late.\" ___ Associated Press writer Kathy Matheson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Adam Housley reports from California SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Despite national outrage after a Mexican man killed a woman along a waterfront pier, San Francisco officials upheld the city's strict\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0protections for people who are in the country illegally. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday for a measure that clarifies when city workers, including police officers, can notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement of a person's immigration status. Generally, the defendant must be charged with a violent crime and is someone who has been convicted of a violent crime within the past seven years. The measure, however, also grants San Francisco's sheriff leeway to contact immigration authorities in the limited cases of defendants charged with a felony if they have been convicted of other felonies in the past. The vote comes at a time of deep distrust between law enforcement and minority communities in San Francisco. Last week, the police chief was forced to resign after officers shot to death an unarmed black woman, the third such death since December. Advocates of\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0protections at the board meeting cheered the proposal's passage, even with the discretions given the sheriff. They say that a clear division between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is needed to foster trust. The\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0law dates back to 1989. The killing of Kate Steinle in July 2015 and the arrest of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez put San Francisco's leaders on the defensive as critics and outside politicians, including presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, called for a change in the city's\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0law. The sheriff at the time, Ross Mirkarimi, cited the law in defending the release of the man, a repeat drug offender and habitual border-crosser. Mirkarimi, already facing tough re-election prospects, lost to a candidate who said she would have considered greater communication between the city and federal government. That sheriff, Vicki Hennessy, fought the board's original proposal and said her office should have more discretion. As a constitutionally elected officer, she does not have to follow board orders. Supervisor John Avalos, the measure's chief sponsor, said that a judge must find that the defendant is likely guilty of a violent felony before the rule can kick in. That's a higher standard than a simple charge by the district attorney's office, he said. \"This is actually legislation that sets a clear standard for how we practice our sanctuary-city policies in San Francisco,\" Avalos said. Hennessy said she worked on a compromise because she \"felt it was better for the city to have one unified policy and still have more options for review than what we have now.\" The ordinance allows the sheriff to share release information with ICE if the person is charged with a felony and has been convicted of one serious felony or convicted of three other qualifying felonies within the previous five years. Hennessey said Tuesday that she would not have contacted ICE in the case of Lopez-Sanchez because he was not wanted on a felony. \"We reached agreement that will serve public safety, family unity and bring our community together,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "White House reporter for the Associated Press Josh Lederman explains why both nominees are 'retrenching behind their most vicious attacks' Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both faced side battles on the campaign trail Tuesday, with one having to denounce an unwanted quasi-endorsement and the other having to spar with a heckler at her rally. The Trump campaign denounced an apparent endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan publication \"The Crusader.\" The paper\u2019s front page read \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d a slogan used by Trump during the election season. \u201cYou can see it on the shirts, buttons, posters and ball caps. \u2026 But can it happen? Can America really be great again? This is what we will soon find out!\u201d it read. The campaign denounced the support in a statement later. \u201cThis publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign.\u201d Thomas Robb, the paper\u2019s editor, told The Washington Post that it wasn\u2019t necessarily an endorsement of Trump. \u201cOverall, we do like his nationalist views and his words about shutting down the border to illegal aliens. It\u2019s not an endorsement because, like anybody, there\u2019s things you disagree with,\u201d Robb said.\u00a0 \u201cBut he kind of reflects what\u2019s happening throughout the world. There seems to be a surge of nationalism worldwide as nationals reclaim their borders.\u201d Meanwhile, Clinton was speaking at a campaign rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. when a heckler shouted \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist!\u201d and waved a sign that echoed his statement. Clinton wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cI am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and the anger of people who support Donald Trump,\u201d she said. According to the New York Post, similar protesters aren\u2019t uncommon at Clinton rallies. But it\u2019s rare for her to respond to them. As the election looms, both candidates are anticipated to increase the heated rhetoric that has driven the campaign. Clinton turned her attention Tuesday to focus on Trump\u2019s comments on women, calling him a bully. This time she brought with her former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight after winning the 1996 contest. Trump, while in Pennsylvania Tuesday, warned that electing Clinton would \"destroy American health care forever.\" Clinton's and Trump's closing campaign advertisements reiterate the race's sharply negative tone. Her campaign has several commercials out that directly question whether Trump would launch a nuclear attack. The ads feature clips of him saying he likes to be unpredictable and would \"bomb the (expletive) out of them.\" She's also doubled down on her argument that Trump's offensive comments about women, as well as his boasts about touching women without their permission, disqualify him from the White House. A 60-second ad that features Trump in his own words over the years concludes: \"Anyone who believes, anyone who says, anyone who does what he does, is unfit to be president.\" Meanwhile, Trump's ads reinforce his message that the country risks doom if it doesn't change directions by electing him. \"Hillary Clinton will keep us on the road to stagnation,\" a narrator says in one of his latest ads. Fox News\u2019 Chris Snyder and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But a CBS/NYT poll out today suggests that the outrage and fear that has followed the worst Islamist terror attack in the U.S. since 9/11 is helping Trump. The poll, the first of real repute to show him breaking out of his usual range of about a quarter of the vote, has Trump dominating the GOP with 35 percent. Trump is up 16 points since the organizations\u2019 previous survey in October. While this poll was taken before his call for a Muslim crackdown, Trump had already expressed interest in a suggestion to force Muslim Americans to register with the federal government. Voters pretty well knew where he stood on religious tests. And we have real evidence that Trump\u2019s plan to single out visitors based on religion is doing him good, at least in South Carolina \u2013 the vanguard for the Southern, conservative states that will dominate the early going in the upcoming GOP primary season. A new Fox News poll seems to confirm that in the \u201cfirst in the South\u201d primary, Trump\u2019s Muslim ban plan has helped him. The poll was in the field for four days, two of which came after Trump called for the religious test for entry. Trump did 8 points better after the ban than before it. And you can also compare that with a Winthrop University poll taken before Trump overawed the airwaves. In the older poll, the New York billionaire led the field by 8 points rather than the 20 points by which he leads the Fox News poll. Certainly Newt Gingrich\u2019s harsh words about some of the 3 million or so Muslim Americans four years ago helped him to his South Carolina primary victory, so it\u2019s not so surprising that Trump would be successful in a climate of much greater alarm about domestic terrorism. If these Trump polls are harbingers rather than temporary responses to turmoil, the pressure on candidates approaching the vanishing point is going to hugely intensify. Calls for candidates to drop out and support one of the two viable non-Trump candidates, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, will grow as the GOP accelerates toward what promises to be a catastrophic general election.Power Play: Rep. Jolly defends his call for Trump to self deport - Rep.

Clinton\u2019s stance on accepting Syrian refugees, and her ongoing FBI investigation made over half of respondents less likely to vote for her.

            "article_content": "More than 800 illegal immigrants from countries of concern who were set for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship because the Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t have their fingerprints on file, according to an internal audit released Monday. The Homeland Security Department\u2019s inspector general found the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration. In the case of 858 immigrants from \"special interest countries or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud,\" the discrepancies weren\u2019t caught because their fingerprints were missing from government databases. A few even managed to get aviation or transportation worker credentials, though they were later revoked. One became a law enforcement officer. The findings were released, incidentally, as authorities were investigating a string of weekend attacks, allegedly connected to foreign-born suspects. The inspector general report could further fuel warnings about immigration security. The report warned that when immigrants become naturalized, \"these individuals retain many of the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship, including serving in law enforcement, obtaining a security clearance, and sponsoring other aliens\u2019 entry into the United States.\" The tally in the report was provided by the administration in mid-2014. But the problem could be even worse. According to the audit, as of November 2015, the administration has found 953 more \"who had final deportation orders under another identity and had been naturalized,\" some of whom were from countries of concern. DHS Inspector General John Roth also\u00a0found fingerprints missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants' files to add fingerprints to the digital record. \u201cThis situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,\u201d Roth said. \u201cTo prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, USCIS needs access to these fingerprint records.\u201d Roth added that DHS has agreed to the recommendations made in the audit and that ICE has plans to \u201creview the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal a deportation order under a different identity.\u201d The gap in fingerprints was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn't consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated. Roth's report said federal prosecutors have accepted two criminal cases that led to the immigrants being stripped of their citizenship. But prosecutors declined another 26 cases. ICE is investigating 32 other cases after closing 90 investigations. ICE officials told auditors the agency hadn't pursued many of these cases in the past because federal prosecutors \"generally did not accept immigration benefits fraud cases.\" ICE said the Justice Department has now agreed to focus on cases involving people who have acquired security clearances, jobs of public trust or other security credentials. Mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone ordered deported can have serious consequences because U.S. citizens can typically apply for and receive security clearances or take security-sensitive jobs. At least three of the immigrants-turned-citizens were able to acquire aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. Their credentials were revoked after they were identified as having been granted citizenship improperly, Roth said in his report. A fourth person is now a law enforcement officer. Roth recommended that all of the outstanding cases be reviewed and fingerprints in those cases be added to the government's database and that immigration enforcement officials create a system to evaluate each of the cases of immigrants who were improperly granted citizenship. DHS officials agreed with the recommendations and said the agency is working to implement the changes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Voters trust Trump to do a better job on the top two.\u00a0 He bests Clinton by 12 points on both the economy (53-41 percent) and terrorism (52-40 percent). The poll, released Thursday, was conducted prior to news of an EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo crashing in the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Clinton has the edge on social issues (+12 points), education (+10), foreign policy (+10), health care (+3), and immigration (+2). Trump is the candidate voters believe will do a better job \u201ctelling the truth to the American people\u201d (+15 points), managing tax dollars (+14 points), and restoring trust in government (+8 points). Trust of the candidates is about equal when it comes to using military force (Trump +1), nominating Supreme Court justices (Clinton +1), and \u201cencouraging values you believe in\u201d (Clinton +2). Immigration is a signature issue for Trump, but more voters not only trust Clinton to handle it, but she is also picked by a 35-point margin on \u201crepresenting the views of Latinos.\u201d Nearly one in five (17 percent) says agreeing on immigration issues is a deal-breaker for them when deciding their vote for president.\u00a0 That increases to 29 percent among Hispanic/Latino voters. But who would voters trust with the nuclear codes?\u00a0 That\u2019s Clinton, by 11 points (49-38 percent). Pollpourri From the beginning of his campaign, Trump has said he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0 People believe him.\u00a0 By a 54-42 percent margin, voters think Trump \u201ctruly will\u201d build the wall.\u00a0 By 50-44 percent, they believe he will forcibly deport illegal immigrants. Those who plan to vote for Trump (66 percent) are more likely than Clinton supporters (46 percent) to think he\u2019ll build the wall.\u00a0 At the same time, Trump voters (43 percent) are less likely than those backing Clinton (60 percent) to think he\u2019ll forcibly deport illegal immigrants. Overall, voters are more likely than not to believe Trump will nominate a conservative to the Supreme Court (65-22 percent) and ban non-U.S. Muslims (58-37 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,021 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from May 14-17, 2016.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Carol Jones knows what she wants to hear Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump discuss during their first televised debate: education and jobs. She's far from sure which candidate will earn her vote on Election Day. \"All we see is the cat fighting,\" says the Shirley, Arkansas, retired substitute teacher. At Monday's debate, the 70-year-old says, \"they need to talk about their programs ... but I don't think they will.\" A majority of Americans, like Jones, say they're frustrated, angry \u2014 or both \u2014 with the 2016 presidential election, according to a new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most Americans aren't feeling proud or hopeful about the race, and half feel helpless, the results find. Majorities of Americans want more focus on issues that are important to them, starting with health care, Social Security, education, terrorism and homeland security. Apathy isn't the problem, the survey found. Eighty-six percent of Americans are paying at least some attention to the race. The campaign is certainly hard to miss. Trump and Clinton are the two least popular presidential candidates in history, and their ferocious battle is smashing precedents and dominating public discourse. Trump has built his campaign in large part on attention-getting \u2014 and frequently untrue \u2014 accusations, such as that his opponent \"is the devil\" and President Barack Obama \"founded\" the Islamic State group. But he's found success linking the nation's immigration woes to its national security concerns, the latter of which is rated by Americans as among the top issues facing the country. Clinton is a former senator and secretary of state who is an avowed foreign and domestic policy wonk. She has tried to make the election, in part, a referendum on Trump's fitness for office. Her recent stumble during an abrupt exit from this year's 9/11 memorial ceremony, captured on video, added to the reality-show quality of the election. Her campaign disclosed that she'd been diagnosed with pneumonia. Clinton and Trump have clear political and stylistic objectives during their first debate Monday, the first of three such showdowns certain to influence the race in its final six weeks. For both, it's about rattling the other candidate \u2014 and not being baited into a less-than-presidential performance. Trump is looking to shore up his credibility with moderate white voters, particularly women, after more than a year of remarks that appeared intolerant or bigoted. Clinton is trying to appeal to young Americans, who are unenthusiastic about her candidacy. Issues? Jones suggests the candidates owe more on that front it to potential voters who don't have access to the internet or the time she has to hunt down their policy positions. \"I went looking on the internet for (Clinton's) position on free (college) education, and it was hard, but I finally found it,\" says the lifelong Democrat, who isn't sold on Clinton because she doesn't trust her, or husband Bill, the former president and governor of Jones' state. \"They need to talk about their programs on this, this and that.\" Whether the candidates ever get to informative discussions of their policy positions and their professional qualifications is unclear. But the demand is there. The survey found that nearly two-thirds of Americans say the campaign focuses too little on the issues that matter to them personally. More than 6 in 10 Americans of both parties agree. A bit more than half say there's been too little focus on the candidates' qualifications, with Democrats being more likely than Republicans to feel that way, 61 percent to 45 percent. And more than half of Americans in the survey said the campaign is focused too much on the personal characteristics of the candidates, with Republicans and Democrats about equally likely to feel that way. The issues Americans care most about? Health care comes in first, with 81 percent listing that as very or extremely important, while similarly high percentages said the same about Social Security, education, terrorism and homeland security. The next most-cited issues: crime and economic growth, which three-quarters of respondents listed as at least very important. Similar majorities cited poverty and taxes. Ranking lower, according to the findings: immigration, with just 61 percent listing the issue as very or extremely important to them. There's bipartisan agreement on the importance of some issues. Nearly identical percentages of Democrats and Republicans call crime and unemployment top issues. At least three-quarters from both parties call Social Security very important. On many other issues, their priorities diverge: Democrats are particularly likely to call health care and poverty top issues, while Republicans are particularly likely to rank terrorism, taxes, debt and foreign policy as very important. About 7 in 10 Democrats but less than half of Republicans named as top issues call gun control and income inequality. Three-quarters of Democrats, but only about a third of Republicans, say the same about racism, the environment and climate change. Republicans are far more likely to name international trade agreements as a very or extremely important issue. And 7 in 10 Republicans, but only about half of Democrats, call immigration a top priority. Among Americans with a favorable opinion of Trump, nearly 8 in 10 say so. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,022 adults was conducted Sept. 15-18 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone. ___ On Twitter, follow at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman and Swanson at http://www.twitter.com/El_Swan ___ Online: AP-NORC Center: http://www.apnorc.org/",

            "article_content": "Jeff Cook is looking to cash in on angry Canada-bound voters \u2018If my candidate doesn\u2019t win, I\u2019m moving to Canada.\u2019 It\u2019s a common refrain, perhaps even more so in the heated 2016 race \u2013 but one South Carolina real estate agent is trying to cash in on the voter discontent. Jeff Cook has put up roughly a dozen billboards across eastern South Carolina with pictures of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton staring down, next to the phrase, \u201cMoving to Canada? We can sell your home.\u201d The 48-foot by 15-foot advertisements offering the services of\u00a0Jeff Cook Real Estate\u00a0started cropping up along freeways and interstate highways back when the Republican convention began last month. The signs are, naturally, a bit tongue-in-cheek \u2013 after all, few ever make good on threats to move across the northern border. But Cook tells FoxNews.com they\u2019re generating business, including from people who say they're looking to make that move. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke, obviously, but we have actually started the application process for people who want to move if their candidate doesn\u2019t win,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they understand the immigration issues, cost and paperwork that comes with this. But they say they\u2019re serious.\u201d Cook\u2019s billboards have become a sensation across social media, resulting in about 200 additional phone calls a week from around the world. Most of the callers are looking for a good realtor, some are members of the media (including press from New Zealand and Great Britain) and others are fascinated by the ads and want to give their opinion. He says his website traffic has jumped from 30,000 to 150,000 hits per month and he has hired additional agents to handle the workload. But not all the calls are friendly. \u201cPeople in Canada are calling saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t send those people up here; we don\u2019t want anything to do with those people,\u2019\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe also had someone from Mexico call and they were mad that we\u2019re not sending people to Mexico.\u201d Cook has also fielded calls from Canadian realtors who want the referrals to any clients who move. So far, Cook says he has about 20 people in the application process who say they\u2019ll wait to see if their candidate loses before placing their homes up for sale. \u201cIf their candidate doesn\u2019t get in \u2013 they want to go,\u201d Cook said. Tommy Welch, 34, of Charleston, is one of those people. A Trump supporter mulling over what he would do if Clinton wins, he said he saw the billboard and called Cook. He filled out the paperwork and is now debating: Toronto or Montreal? \u201cThe billboard is kind of comical but right on; the election is a scary deal that everyone is gearing up for,\u201d Welch said. \u201cI would definitely, 100 percent, positively entertain the possibility [of moving] if Hillary won.\u201d Welch, a real estate investor, says he owns three homes and would sell them all, and uproot his family of four. Another Charleston resident and Trump backer who wanted to be identified only by his first name, Jim, said he too called Cook after seeing one of the billboards and filled out the form. \u201cIf Hillary wins, I will definitely move out of this country,\u201d said Jim, 72. \u201cI\u2019d like to say I\u2019ll go to Canada, because it\u2019s the closest place I could get to. Any place but here.\u201d Cook is casting himself as an equal opportunity realtor. He\u2019ll sell the homes of conservatives who want to flee a Clinton presidency, and liberals who want nothing to do with a Trump-led America. (That latter list would include celebrities threatening to\u00a0leave if Trump wins\u00a0like Cher, Samuel L. Jackson and Raven-Symone.) The clients \u2013 and the phone calls \u2013 are \u201cpretty evenly split\u201d in their support for Trump or Clinton. So far no one has actually sold their house because of the election, he said. He\u2019s also gotten new clients moving locally who called because they thought the billboards were funny. As for Cook, who is he voting for? \u201cI\u2019m not going to say,\u201d he said.",

But how about this: Only 37 percent of voters under 30 approve of the job the president is doing. That\u2019s a 17-point decline in one year among the voters who represent what was once the core of the president\u2019s coalition. These are the people to whom the president is making an increasingly frantic plea to enroll in ObamaCare. And surely the \u201cLie of the Year\u201d about Americans being able to keep their coverage and care under his law is a big reason. Sixty-one percent of all respondents believed he knew at the time that his statements were untrue.

Sixty-seven percent favor a delay in its implementation, including 54 percent of Democrats.] Can you hear me now? - But when it comes to younger voters, the other big scandal \u2013 the president misleading voters about his expansion of domestic surveillance \u2013 is likely just as important.

Reporters expect that could come as soon as today. Fox News has more. PUTIN STICKS UP FOR OBAMA ON SPYING - Russian President Vladimir Putin claims Moscow is not controlling leaker Edward Snowden. Putin told reporters Thursday that anything published by Snowden came prior to his arrival in Russia. The Russian President maintains that Snowden\u2019s asylum was conditioned on halting anti-American activities. Putin also defended the NSA\u2019s surveillance program saying it is a necessary defense against terror but cautioned it needs to follow the rules.

Max Baucus, D-Mont., will be Obama\u2019s nominee to replace U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, who will step down early next year.\u00a0 Baucus has already announced he will not be seeking re-election in 2014. Democrats are hoping Baucus\u2019 early departure will help them hold a seat that looks bound to switch to red. Gov. Steve Bullock, D-Mont., will have the chance to appoint someone to serve out the rest of the Senate Finance Committee chairman\u2019s term. Lt. Gov. John Walsh D-Mont., already in the running, looks to be the most likely recipient. Republican Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., is considered the frontrunner for the Red Team. YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: MEDIA MASOCHISTS - The media are masochists for taking the Obama administration\u2019s contempt for the past five years. That was the sentiment viewers of all political stripes shared with Daily Caller\u2019s Tucker Carlson during Wednesday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d All-Star Panel. Bing Pulse also tracked widespread agreement when NPR\u2019s Mara Liasson said \u201cThe White house feels it is perfectly okay to take a picture, post it on Twitter or wherever\u201d instead of giving the press access. Discussion of the eroding faith the American people have in government drew increased viewer participation. Democrats, Republicans and independent viewers voiced their agreement with the latest Fox News Poll that shows President Obama knew Americans would lose their doctors under ObamaCare. Weekly Standard Writer Stephen Hayes saw a spike in viewer votes when he charged, \u201cjournalists always complain about things that affect journalists. Where was the moral outrage when journalists were lied to about what happened in Benghazi?\u201d On that point, viewer votes surged to 15,636 votes per minute. Bing Pulse measured 111,143 votes overall. You can see the full results in a deeper data dive here. Be an opinion maker \u2013 take your seat on the panel.

            "article_content": "FILE- IN this June 11, 2015, file photo, actress Diane Guerrero attends Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ORANGECON Celebration at Skylight Clarkson SQ in New York. The depression, the anxiety and the emotional instability that Guerrero went through due to the separation from her parents are some of the points she writes about in her new memoir \"In the Country We Love: My Family Divided,\" as well as her later professional development and her work in the successful Netflix series \"Orange Is The New Black\" and The CW\u2019s \"Jane The Virgin.\" (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) (The Associated Press) LOS ANGELES \u2013 One afternoon upon returning from school, Diane Guerrero found her home empty. The TV actress was only 14 when she was left completely alone after her parents were detained and deported to their native Colombia. The depression, anxiety and emotional instability that followed are some of the personal struggles the 29-year-old actress reveals in her new memoir, \"In the Country We Love: My Family Divided.\" She also discusses her later development as an actress and working on the popular Netflix series \"Orange Is the New Black\" and The CW's \"Jane The Virgin.\" In essence, the 257-pages book, just released by Henry Holt and Co., illustrates one of the heartbreaks of today's immigration crisis: U.S.-born children who are left alone when their parents are deported. About 4.1 million American children have at least one parent who lives in the U.S. illegally, according to the Migration Policy Institute. \"We have a lot of comments on the news, we have a lot of rhetoric over what an immigrant is and what a deportee is, but you don't hear any real stories. I don't think we ever had the chance to really tell our side,\" said Guerrero, responding in a recent interview to why she wrote the book. \"I am here, a citizen of this country and I'm saying, 'Hey, the system failed me. I am a good citizen. I contribute to this country and here I am sharing my story. What are you going to do now?'\" she added. Guerrero's older brother was also deported, but she decided to stay behind with friends because of her firm belief that America offered many more opportunities than Colombia. \"My parents were clear from the beginning (about the possibility of deportation). That was a topic of every day, so I was very well aware and my father did a good job of preparing me if the inevitable happened,\" said the actress. \"I wanted to follow my dreams and finish what my parents started when they came here for better opportunities. It was a difficult decision and I don't know if, in hindsight, I would have changed it.\" At one point, Guerrero was so depressed over the absence of her parents, mounting debt and other problems, that she tried to take her own life. \"Once I got to college, that anxiety and pain and confusion kind of came forth. ... Everything that I did or tried to do was harder than normal because I didn't have my parents and their support,\" said the actress. \"I went through many stages. I went through depression, which is something that we don't often talk about when we look at undocumented communities and deported families.\" Her love for the arts started in high school, at the Boston Arts Academy. She later attended Regis College and studied to be a paralegal until she decided to sign up with a Boston casting agency and finally pursue her dream. \"There's light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Guerrero. \"I know that things are scary and we may have a lot of fears, but what we can do now is educate ourselves, we can educate others, we can join this movement, we can understand that our stories are valuable, that we are important and that ... like it or not, we make up the fabric of this country and we have to fight to be part of it because we are part of it, regardless of how many people are telling us that we don't belong.\" Guerrero first told her story in November 2014 in an article in the Los Angeles Times. She was inspired by so-called \"dreamers,\" who publicly acknowledge they grew up in the U.S. without documentation but who are fully assimilated and feel very much like Americans. Reaction to the article was immediate. A few days later, she met President Barack Obama at an event in Las Vegas where he expounded on his just-announced executive order offering dreamers a pathway to documentation. Guerrero's work in \"Orange Is the New Black\" and \"Jane the Virgin\" has yielded success and popularity that she is now using to promote citizenship and voter registration among immigrants, in collaboration with organizations like Immigrant Legal Resource Center and Mi Familia Vota. The actress says writing \"In the Country We Love\" has been a cathartic experience for her. \"After coming out with the book and my story, I feel a lot better, a little clearer about who I am and I don't feel like I'm lying to other people and, most important, I don't feel like I'm lying to myself,\" said Guerrero. \"I want immigration reform to come into fruition and I want it to be comprehensive and I want it to have a path to citizenship and I want to be involved politically every day,\" she added. \"I'm doing that and I'm feeling better because before, I was just kind of floating, you know, I wasn't being a political being and I didn't know where my responsibilities lied in my community and now I've found that.\" ___ Follow E.J.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (The Associated Press) A Code Pink activist is covered by American flags during the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Tuesday, July 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (The Associated Press) People walk on the floor before the start of the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Tuesday, July 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (The Associated Press) The United States depicted at the Republican National Convention is a scary place. It is wrenched by economic uncertainty, social upheaval, political dysfunction, runaway immigration, violent streets and existential threats from abroad. Republicans want voters to see the need for drastic change. The nation's only choice, they say, is Donald Trump. Why Republicans would paint such a bleak portrait and whether things really are as they say: WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? GOP Chairman Reince Priebus opened the convention acknowledging \"troubling times.\" Others used less measured terms. Americans live in fear, they said. The country is disrespected by the world, its military is gutted, its police are shamed. Borders are porous. Terrorism is a constant threat. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said the U.S. suffers from \"an economic disaster ... and the American people know it.\" Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said \"our allies see us shrinking from our place as a leader in the world.\" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani pointed to \"the terrorists who are killing us and our allies.\" He concluded: \"There is no next election. ... There's no more time for us left to revive our great country.\" ___ WHAT'S THE REALITY? The United States has seen some tough times, but it is in better shape than most of the world. Americans are still much less likely to become victims of domestic or international terrorism than most Europeans and citizens of Middle East nations. Violent crime in the United States has dropped steadily since 1992, according to FBI statistics. In May, unemployment dipped to its lowest rate since November 2007, a year before Obama's election. The economy has grown for much of Obama's tenure. But the middle class has taken a hit. Average household incomes are rising, but that's largely due to higher pay for the richest 10 percent of American households. Still, the United States is outperforming most of the world's advanced economies. Last year, the U.S. economy grew 2.4 percent, compared to 0.5 percent in Japan, 2.2 percent in Britain and 1.7 percent in the 19 countries that share the euro currency. China, which Trump often says has out-maneuvered the U.S. on economic matters, is growing faster than the United States. But the U.S. is far richer: Economic output per person last year was $56,000 in the U.S. and $7,900 in China. ___ HOW DO AMERICANS SEE IT? It's a mixed answer. Though Obama's job approval ratings have been positive for much of 2016, Americans are anxious. A recent Associated Press GfK-Poll found almost 4 out of 5 American voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. And there's a seemingly never-ending cycle of bad news: a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida; assassinations of police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas; and high-profile killings of black men by police. ___ THE POLITICS Tapping into Americans' anxiety \u2014 and deepening it \u2014 may be a logical strategy for Trump to win over moderate Democratic and independent voters. He entered the convention trailing Clinton in most polls. His favorability ratings are extremely low, even worse than Clinton's dismal numbers. Conventions normally offer candidates an opportunity to introduce themselves to Americans who don't follow politics too closely. Trump is already extremely well-known and will have a hard time changing voters' opinions about him. However, no one can deny that Trump is the candidate of change. Clinton has been running as the candidate who will build on Obama's legacy. If voters agree that things are truly awful and the country needs a dramatic change, the only candidate who fits the bill is the brash, tough-talking billionaire developer and reality star. ___ THERE'S A HISTORY A party out of the White House for two terms tends to frame the current leadership as a failure. Accepting his nomination in 2008, Obama declared: \"We are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight.\" Ronald Reagan ousted Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980 amid economic and international turmoil. Yet Reagan and Obama wove an intrinsic optimism into their arguments. Obama's slogan was \"Hope and Change.\" Reagan summoned biblical imagery to describe the United States as a \"shining city on a hill.\" Trump's pitch is perhaps most comparable to Richard Nixon's law-and-order campaign in 1968, another turbulent year at home and abroad. Nixon told Republicans in his acceptance speech that \"America is trouble today,\" mired in war \"with no end in sight\" and unable \"to manage its own economy.\" Trump insists his motto \u2014 \"Make America Great Again\" \u2014 is optimistic. But the subtext is his indictment of a nation that \"never wins anymore.\" He suggests stability and greatness will re-emerge because of his touch, rather than something inherent in the American people. ___ AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Political Insiders on potential Capitol Hill reaction Nearly two months after President Obama announced his immigration executive actions, questions remain over whether the Department of Homeland Security can be ready to process millions of additional immigrants through an already-burdened system. DHS is on a hiring spree as it sets an ambitious schedule \u2013 outlined in a recent memo from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the DHS agency in charge of processing the requests -- for accepting new applicants. The agency plans to begin accepting applications in late February under an expanded program for those who came to the U.S. illegally as children (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA). And the agency is looking to May to implement the biggest, and most controversial, plank of Obama\u2019s plan \u2013 effectively legalizing potentially millions of parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents. But the colossal effort, on a tight timetable, perhaps inevitably has some questioning whether they can pull it off. One source inside the Department of Homeland Security told Fox News that so far, not enough has been done to get that machine up and running on time. The source raised the specter of the HealthCare.gov launch. \u201cThere is a state of confusion at DHS,\u201d said the DHS source, who works in immigration enforcement, claiming that \u201cjust like ObamaCare, the administration is eager to make an announcement, but infrastructure is lacking to make it happen.\u201d The administration wants to hire 1,000 workers to help process applications out of a new facility in Crystal City, Va., just outside Washington. Ken Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council (NCISC), the union representing USCIS employees, said he recently toured the new operations center and it has little in it but leftover furniture from the last government tenant. With the agency aiming for Feb. 20 or so to launch the first phase, that leaves less than six weeks to hire, vet and train these new employees, he told FoxNews.com. \u201cThey want to do this in February \u2013 this is unheard of,\u201d Palinkas said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in government for 15 years, and I know things don\u2019t get done on time.\u201d While the administration scrambles to get ready, Republican foes in Congress continue their quest to halt the effort. Republicans are debating legislation this week to block funding for the immigration actions. But supporters of the program say that beyond leasing new office space and hiring employees, USCIS has been readying for the influx for some time and has learned from the rollout of DACA, which has been processing tens of thousands of young undocumented immigrants since 2012. Further, the administration already has launched a new policy, as a result of Obama\u2019s November announcement, for immigration enforcement and deportations. \u201cThe agency knew for a long time to anticipate something coming,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, of the American Immigration Council. \u201cThey have been planning and thinking and modernizing for years. I think ramping it up to five million probably won\u2019t be as hard as you think.\u201d Under what\u2019s known as \u201cdeferred action,\u201d those eligible would be able to work legally and avoid deportation for three years, as well as qualify for services offered by their state. Children and parents would have to demonstrate they have been living in the U.S. continuously since 2010. DHS officials, meanwhile, describe an across-the-board effort to prepare, including multiple avenues for members of the public to get answers and training for employees. A DHS spokeswoman stressed that Secretary Jeh Johnson has issued several sets of guidance, and training has begun for the new enforcement and removal program. She noted Johnson met with leaders from several agencies in Texas, and said there has been \u201cextensive communication\u201d with employees, in addition to DHS-sponsored town halls across the country. As for the looming flood of applications, she said: \u201cUSCIS is building the additional capacity needed to begin accepting requests for upcoming immigration initiatives.\u201d She said additional workers and the new facility \u201cwill ensure that every case processed by USCIS receives a thorough review under our guidelines.\u201d The spokeswoman said the USCIS website will be updated with new information \u201con a regular basis,\u201d and hotlines are available for people to call if they have questions or need help. Further, the departments of Homeland Security and State recently launched an outreach effort detailing eligibility requirements. The effort, which includes radio and TV ads, is aimed at the Mexican and Central American public, telling them whom the executive actions apply to and urging against more illegal immigration. Separate fliers remind would-be applicants that nobody can apply yet. An estimated 3.7 million would be eligible for the program affecting parents of legal residents; and roughly 290,000 would be eligible for the expanded DACA. The example of the 2012 DACA shows a significant number of those who qualify apply, and most who do are approved. According to the Migration Policy Institute, some 55 percent of the 1.2 million who qualified in 2012 have applied in the last two years. According to their numbers, 682,189 had applied as of July 2014; approval was granted to 587,366. Those approved early in the program already are applying for renewals, which would add to the processing pressure on the agency. According to the Brookings Institution, renewal applications should be in the 20,000-40,000 range per month until at least June. There have been numerous reports about DACA backlogs threatening a smooth roll-out of the expanded programs. Meanwhile, a class-action suit filed against DHS and USCIS in July by asylum-seekers who say they have been in \u201climbo\u201d cited a backlog of more than 45,000 in that program. \u201cThe question is, how prepared is the agency going into this, and what things look like on their end,\u201d said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at Brookings. She is a supporter of the program who believes USCIS learned a lot in the last two years and will be depending on an \u201carmy\u201d of municipal and community-based organizations to help streamline the effort. According to a New York Times report in late December, the new operations center was leased for nearly $8 million a year, and salaries are expected to cost more than $40 million annually. Palinkas, who opposes the president\u2019s executive actions, said he\u2019s been surprised at the \u201caggressive\u201d nature of the roll-out. \u201cMy personal opinion is they are working more aggressively for illegal [immigrants] than for people who are legally taking the route [to citizenship],\u201d he said. Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which also opposes the actions, questioned where the money for the building comes from. \u201cThere is no doubt the agency has been planning this action for a quite some time,\u201d she told FoxNews.com. \u201cMy idea is they squirreled away money from the fee revenues from other programs to get this off the ground \u2026 without authorization from Congress.\u201d This is the funding stream congressional Republicans are targeting. Vaughan also predicted that with the influx of new applicants and the president\u2019s ambitious timetable, USCIS agents will be pressured to \u201crubber stamp\u201d requests. \u201cIt\u2019s completely impossible for the agency to accommodate all these applications and process them with any integrity whatsoever,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is five times their workload we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Singer said aside from criminal background checks, applicants must meet specific criteria and provide documentation of their ages and residency. \u201cRubber stamping\u201d isn\u2019t an option, she said. \u201cPeople can speculate all they want. But this is a program the agency is taking very seriously, it\u2019s very high profile and nothing is going to fly under the radar.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Terror in America: ISIS and Election 2016 - A look at how the Orlando massacre illustrates the scope and diversity of ISIS' threat and whether Trump and Clinton have the plan to counter the terror group Newly obtained congressional data shows hundreds of terror plots have been stopped in the U.S. since 9/11 \u2013 mostly involving foreign-born suspects, including dozens of refugees. The files are sure to inflame the debate over the Obama administration\u2019s push to admit thousands more refugees from Syria and elsewhere, a proposal Donald Trump has vehemently opposed on the 2016 campaign trail. \u201c[T]hese data make clear that the United States not only lacks the ability to properly screen individuals prior to their arrival, but also that our nation has an unprecedented assimilation problem,\u201d Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told President Obama in a June 14 letter, obtained by FoxNews.com. The files also give fresh insight into the true scope of the terror threat and cover a wide range of cases, including: While the June 12 massacre at an Orlando gay nightclub marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 2001, the data shows America has been facing a steady stream of plots. For the period September 2001 through 2014, data shows the U.S. successfully prosecuted 580 individuals for terrorism and terror-related cases. Further, since early 2014, at least 131 individuals were identified as being implicated in terror. Across both those groups, the senators reported that at least 40 people initially admitted to the U.S. as refugees later were convicted or implicated in terror cases. Among the 580 convicted, they said, at least 380 were foreign-born. The top countries of origin were Pakistan, Lebanon and Somalia, as well as the Palestinian territories. Both Sessions and Cruz sit on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, which compiled the terror-case information based on data from the Justice Department, news reports and other open-source information. The files were shared with FoxNews.com. The files include dates, states of residence, countries of origin for foreign-born suspects, and reams of other details. Specifically, they show a sharp spike in cases in 2015, largely stemming from the arrest of suspects claiming allegiance to the Islamic State. They also show a heavy concentration of cases involving suspects from California, Texas, New York and Minnesota, among other states. EXPLORE THE DATA IN THE MAPS AND CHARTS BELOW The senators say the terror-case repository still is missing critical details on suspects\u2019 immigration history, which they say the Department of Homeland Security has \u201cfailed to provide.\u201d Immigration data the senators compiled came from other sources. Sessions and Cruz asked the president in their letter to order the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State to \"update\" and provide more detailed information. The senators have sent several letters to those departments since last year requesting immigration histories of those tied to terror. \u201cThe administration refuses to give out the information necessary to establish a sound policy that protects Americans from terrorists,\u201d Sessions said in a statement to Fox News. Asked about the complaints, DHS spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen told FoxNews.com the department \u201cwill respond to the senators\u2019 request directly and not through the press.\u201d \u201cMore than 100 Congressional committees, subcommittees, caucuses, commissions and groups exercise oversight and ensure accountability of DHS and we work closely with them on a daily basis. We\u2019ve received unprecedented requests from a number of senators and representatives for physical paper files for more than 700 aliens,\u201d she said, adding that officials have to review each page manually for privacy and other issues. Cruz ran unsuccessfully this year for the Republican presidential nomination. Sessions, an ardent critic of the administration\u2019s immigration policies, is supporting presumptive GOP nominee Trump. The allegations detailed in the subcommittee\u2019s research pertain to a range of cases, involving suspects caught traveling or trying to travel overseas to fight, as well as suspects ensnared in controversial sting operations which civil-liberties groups including the ACLU have criticized. In a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch said nearly half of the federal counterterror convictions at the time came from \u201cinformant-based cases,\u201d many of them sting operations where the informants played a role in the plot. The report said: \u201cIn some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target\u2019s willingness to act.\u201d But even in some of those cases, federal agents got involved after learning of a serious suspected plot. In the case of the Seattle suspect, Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, authorities said he approached someone in 2011 about attacking a military installation. That citizen alerted law enforcement and worked with them to capture Latif and an accomplice. FoxNews.com\u2019s Liz Torrey contributed to this report.",

Rudy will be the chairman \u2026 He should be able to come back quickly [with findings],\u201d Trump told Fox News. After the presumptive Republican presidential nominee earlier this week first floated the idea of naming the Giuliani to lead the group, he told Fox News on Friday that he\u2019s since spoken with Giuliani about the job. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at the problem. We\u2019re going to study the problem -- it\u2019s a temporary ban,\u201d Trump said. And he said the group would look at the U.S.-Mexico border, which he said is like \"Swiss cheese.\" While offering more details about the commission, Trump also helped settle some confusion about whether the \u201ctemporary ban\u201d \u2013 arguably the candidate\u2019s most controversial proposal of his entire campaign \u2013 is still being considered. Trump said earlier this week it\u2019s only a \u201csuggestion.\u201d Trump also had told Fox News earlier this week, before a high-profile set of meetings with GOP leaders in Washington, that he would like to \u201cback off as soon as possible\u201d on the ban. He made clear on Friday that he still wants to study the idea, but continued to say it\u2019s just a \u201csuggestion,\u201d as many of his campaign proposals are. \u201cAnything I say right now -- I\u2019m not the president, everything\u2019s a suggestion,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI feel strongly we have to do something.\u201d Meanwhile, the plan continues to fuel likely general election rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s stump speech warnings about Trump. Earlier this week, Clinton cited the plan in calling Trump a \u201cloose cannon\u201d and decried what she described as his \u201chate rhetoric.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Emilio Huerta and his mother, Dolores Huerta. (HuertaforCongress.com) Emilio Huerta (HuertaforCongress.com) District 21 in California is 71 percent Latino and overwhelmingly Democratic. Since 2012, it\u2019s elected David Valadao as its representative in Congress. And that is quite remarkable \u2013 Valadao is a Republican of European descent, the son of Portuguese immigrants. And in his last two congressional races, he beat Latino Democrats. Now, as Valadao seeks his third term in Congress, he is facing what could be his most formidable opponent: lawyer and businessman Emilio Huerta, the son of civil rights and labor icon Dolores Huerta. \u201cThat whole district is a mystery to everyone who has ever looked at it,\u201d said California State University, Bakersfield political science professor Kent Price. \u201cIt has a Democratic advantage, a Latino advantage. Demographically and politically, you look at it and ask \u2018How is it Republican?\u2019\u201d One key factor in Valadao\u2019s favor is that he is a moderate Republican who speaks highly of immigration, often invoking his own family. And as a dairy farmer, he has been able to speak on an intimate level to both farmers and farmworkers, who form a large part of the very agricultural district. Another reason is because of low voter turnout among Latinos in a mostly agricultural district that is one of the poorest in the country. While Latinos make up 55 percent of the district\u2019s registered voters, the voter turnout among the group is at about 20 percent. But Price, as well as other political experts, believe that Huerta can bring Latinos and others who have sat out past elections out to vote on Nov. 8 \u2013 if he plays his cards right. Famous last name Huerta, who never before has run for elected office, has a longtime family connection to farmworkers, and has worked in farmworker rights as a lawyer. He has a keen understanding of the district\u2019s agricultural nature and, of course, he has a famous last name. \u201cEmilio has done his work in the Central Valley,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe has a little more advantage than other Democrats who have run against David Valadao.\u201d California is clearly a blue state \u2013 political jargon for Democrat-leaning \u2013 with nearly 45 percent of the registered voters identifying as Democrats. About 27 percent are registered Republicans, and 23 percent have no party affiliation. Critics accused Valadao of flip-flopping because he initially said he would back the party's presidential nominee, whether that was Donald Trump or not. But over the summer, Valadao said he would not support someone whose rhetoric \u201cdenigrates people based on their ethnicity, religion, or disabilities.\u201d \u201cI am disappointed with the divisive rhetoric coming from this presidential election and cannot support either candidate,\u201d the congressman said in the statement released to the press. Valadao did not respond to interview requests by Fox News Latino. For his part, Huerta is borrowing the grassroots approach that his mother and her fellow labor leader Cesar Chavez used when building their movement for farmworker rights. \u201cMy mom and Cesar had house meetings,\u201d Huerta told Fox News Latino. \u201cWe\u2019ve adopted that method. We\u2019re holding house meetings, we talk to the people around the kitchen table, in their backyards, in local parks, in community centers \u2013 wherever we can do it.\u201d \"There's no wine and cheese,\" he added. The immigrant and Latino community in the district, Huerta said, feels little connection to politicians, and so they feel little motivation to vote. \u201cThe political process has ignored them,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who get up at 4 or 5 a.m. to work, and they work until sundown. The average income for a farmworker family is $20,000 a year. They don\u2019t have the time to figure out what the political process is and how it can benefit them.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s poor quality water, poor quality air,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cA lot of young children suffer bronchial issues. My daughter was born in the district, she\u2019s asthmatic.\u201d Then there is the poor educational record. \u201cFifty percent or less of high school graduates attend college,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThe schools have a lack of resources, I have friends who are teachers and they say they don\u2019t even have AP (advanced placement) courses, like the more affluent districts do.\u201d So he is taking the political world to them, Huerta said. He said he had tried to help them through his work as a lawyer, but then decided he could make a bigger difference by running for office. \u201cIt was surprising for me to learn that some communities in the district are still facing the poor conditions they were facing in the 60s,\u201d Huerta said, \u201cwhen Cesar Chavez was organizing in those areas.\u201d \u201cPower of the incumbency\u201d Price said that Valadao has been able to stay strong in the race by playing it safe and having hefty campaign coffers. \u201cHe has played it middle-of-the-road, he\u2019s a fundraising machine,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe has not been aggressive on immigration. He does nothing to offend anyone. Now he has the power of the incumbency.\u201d Many thought that Valadao\u2019s 2014 Democratic rival, Amanda Renteria, would give him stiff competition. Renteria, who left California for a while, returned in 2013 and announced she was running against Valadao. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) poured $1 million for ads for Renteria. But Renteria lost the race to Valadao by 16 percent. She is now the national political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cEven though Amanda had roots here, she was seen as someone who hadn\u2019t spent much time here, and there\u2019s a very high level of suspicion when an \u2018outsider\u2019 comes in to run,\u201d Price said. Huerta, on the other hand, is running an old-fashioned door-to-door campaign, eschewing the kind of large-apparatus assistance that other Democrats received from the DCCC. Huerta's mother has made appearances with him on support of her son's campaign, but she has not been a fixture on the trail in the district, spending far more time campaigning for Hillary Clinton around the country. \"She was very supportive when I told her I wanted to run,\" Huerta said. \"She's given me a lot of time. But she's got quite a bit on her plate.\" \"She understands the needs of the working folks here in the valley,\" he said. \"She supports us spiritually.\"",

            "article_content": "Melania lays out her agenda as potential first lady WASHINGTON \u2013 Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. The details of Mrs. Trump's early paid modeling work in the U.S. emerged in the final days of a bitter presidential campaign in which her husband, Donald Trump, has taken a hard line on immigration laws and those who violate them. Trump has proposed broader use of the government's E-verify system allowing employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work. He has noted that federal law prohibits illegally paying immigrants. Mrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband's hard line on immigration. The wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. The documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes. The disclosures about the payments come as Mrs. Trump takes on a more substantial role advocating for her husband's candidacy. She made her first speech in months Thursday, in which she spoke of her time working as a model in Europe and her decision to come to the U.S. \"As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here,\" she said. \"Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.\" The documents obtained by the AP included ledgers, other accounting documents and a management agreement signed by Mrs. Trump from Metropolitan International Management that covered parts of 1996 and 1997. The AP obtained the files this week after seeking copies since August from employees of the now-defunct modeling firm, after Mrs. Trump made comments earlier this summer that appeared inconsistent with U.S. immigration rules. A New York immigration lawyer whom Mrs. Trump asked to review her immigration documents, Michael J. Wildes, also reviewed some of the ledgers at AP's request. Wildes said in a brief statement that \"these documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps.\" He did not elaborate or answer additional questions asking for clarification. Wilde appeared to be referring to Mrs. Trump's arrival in the United States on Aug. 27, 1996, one day after the ledgers list a charge for car service to pick up Mrs. Trump from the airport. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also did not answer additional written questions from the AP. Since questions arose earlier this year, Mrs. Trump has declined to publicly release her immigration records. Wildes, the immigration lawyer, released a letter in September that laid out the details of what he said Mrs. Trump's immigration records show, including a seven-week window in which Mrs. Trump was in the U.S. before her work visa was issued. During that seven-week period, the ledgers list modeling work for clients that included Fitness magazine and Bergdorf Goodman department store. The management agreement, which said it was not an employment agreement, included a handwritten date of Aug. 27, 1996. The top of the document said it was \"made and entered into as of this 4th day of September 1996.\" Many of the documents were part of a legal dispute related to the dissolution of the firm in the late 1990s and found recently in storage. The accounting ledgers for the firm's models were listed on hundreds of pages of continuously fed paper that appeared yellowed with age. They were authenticated by a former employee who worked at the firm at the time. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because this person feared retaliation and threats from Trump's presidential campaign. Exhibit markings with the records were also consistent with documents filed in New York state court, including a deposition of one former partner that referred to the same exhibit number. The sworn testimony describing the exhibit's content matches the documents obtained by the AP. A former partner, Paolo Zampolli, who previously told the AP that he recruited Mrs. Trump to come to the U.S. as a model, confirmed that the contract language was used by his firm and his signature appeared on the document. Mrs. Trump's signature on the contract resembled her signature on her marriage license recorded in 2005. Asked about the two dates on the document, Zampolli said he usually vacationed in Europe each August and likely arranged for the contract to be formally executed when he returned to New York after Labor Day, even though Mrs. Trump had signed it eight days earlier. Zampolli previously told the AP that Mrs. Trump obtained a work visa before she modeled professionally in the United States. He said the ledgers for Mrs. Trump were consistent with printouts used by his firm at the time, but he would not personally vouch for them because he said money matters were handled by the company's chief financial officer, who has since died. Zampolli said he did not recall Mrs. Trump working without legal permission. \"Honestly, I don't know. It's like 20 years ago,\" he said. \"The contract looks (like) a real one and the standard one.\" Foreigners are not allowed to use a visitor visa to work for pay in the U.S. for American companies. Doing so would violate the terms of that visa and could prohibit a foreigner from later changing his or her immigration status in the U.S. or bar the foreigner from the United States again without special permission to come back. The E-verify system started in 1997\u2014 after Mrs. Trump came to the country\u2014 and was dramatically expanded after 2007. Some ledgers obtained by the AP identify Mrs. Trump by her professional name and detail her involvement with the modeling agency from July 18, 1996, through Sept. 26, 1997. Other documents from the same accounting ledgers identify Mrs. Trump as Melanija Knaus and list $20,526 in gross earnings for the period before she was granted her work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. The documents also show the modeling company paid for her rent, lent her money and paid for her pager. Some ledgers were first made available to True.Ink, an online lifestyle publication, and then independently obtained and verified by the AP. Metropolitan International Management managed the careers of about 65 women in 1996 and 1997, according to court records. It paid the women as independent contractors, collecting a 20 percent commission and deducting expenses. The ledger shows that the firm also deducted federal taxes from the models' gross earnings, including Mrs. Trump's.",

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (The Associated Press) Indiana Gov. Mike Pence speaks as his wife Karen, looks on at the opening ceremony for the Cops Cycling for Survivors fundraising bike ride in Indianapolis, Monday, July 11, 2016. Pence is being considered as a possible running mate for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who is expected to decide this week, and the two are expected to attend a fundraiser and rally together Tuesday evening. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (The Associated Press) INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 As a conservative talk-radio host in the 1990s, Mike Pence described himself as \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" Two decades later, Pence is the unflappable conservative governor of Indiana who has caught the eye of another fiery personality: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Where the brash billionaire is impulsive, Pence is cool-headed. Where Trump makes conservatives suspicious, Pence has credibility. And where Trump struggles to draw evangelical Christians, Pence is well-regarded by them. A favorite quote highlights how Pence might smooth some of the sharp corners of the Trump campaign and its supporters. \"I'm a conservative,\" Pence has often said. \"But I'm not angry about it.\" The former congressman also is a proven fundraiser with close ties to billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch and their network of wealthy donors, many of whom have been dismissive of Trump. \"One thing you can say about Mike Pence is he's got a very calm, steady demeanor that in some ways is a little Reaganesque,\" said Christine Mathews, a Republican pollster for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. \"He's a counterbalance to Trump in that way.\" Trump's decision, expected by the end of the week, would cap months of speculation. Not so long ago, their relationship was a little awkward. Trump met privately with Pence before Indiana's primaries, seeking his endorsement. Instead, Pence, under pressure from national conservatives, tepidly endorsed Trump's rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, while still lavishing praise on Trump. Trump won that primary. Before the night was over, Cruz had quit the race. For Pence, a former six-term congressman, selection by Trump would offer a return to national politics after his embrace of the role of a governor of conservative social issues sidelined his own presidential ambitions. Describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" Pence marched Indiana to the front lines of the nation's culture wars. In 2015 he provoked a national backlash after signing a law that critics said would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay people for religious reasons. Even some Indiana Republicans have questioned his decisions, suggesting Pence has at times seemed more interested in appealing to national conservatives than doing what's best for the state. For example, Pence's support of the state's religious objections law led to a revolt from the business community, which joined gay rights advocates in successfully pushing for changes to the law. Raised in Columbus, Indiana, in an Irish-Catholic family, Pence revered the Kennedys growing up and has said he voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980. He later identified as an evangelical Christian and was inspired to join the Republican Party by former President Ronald Reagan, whose \"happy warrior\" rhetorical style Pence has since tried to emulate. After attending Hanover College, Pence graduated from Indiana University Law School in 1986. He met his wife, Karen, around the same time and twice unsuccessfully ran for Congress before taking a job at Indiana Policy Review, a conservative think tank. In a 1991 essay titled \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,\" Pence swore off harsh political tactics he used in \"one of the most divisive and negative campaigns in Indiana's modern congressional history\" while calling for \"basic human decency.\" \"That means your First Amendment rights end at the tip of your opponent's nose \u2014 even in the matter of political rhetoric,\" Pence wrote, though in the face of a difficult re-election campaign in Indiana he has since backtracked. In Congress, Pence did not sponsor a single bill that was passed into law. But he built a national following among conservatives for his willingness to buck his own party after opposing President George W. Bush's Medicare expansion and the No Child Left Behind education overhaul. During the early years of President Barack Obama's administration, Pence helped lead the opposition to the Democrat's agenda. \"He has a particularly strong talent, a gift if you will, for being able to stick to principle while making his political opponents or those who disagree with him feel like they are being heard and respected,\" said Ryan Streeter, a former Pence aide and George W. Bush staffer who is now a public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Pence's congressional experience is one trait that Trump, who has never held public office, said he seeks in a running mate. Marc Short, a former Pence aide and top Koch Brothers operative, elaborated: \"He's worked with (House Speaker) Paul Ryan. He's worked with the team in House leadership. He's somebody who has deep relationships in the evangelical movement, and he's somebody who has foreign affairs experience.\" Pence's one term as governor has drawn mixed reaction, and he has managed to alienate moderate Republicans over social issues. Groups threatened boycotts over last year's religious objections law. Late-night television hosts mocked the policy, and a coalition of gay-rights supporters and business interests successfully demanded that lawmakers approve changes. This year Pence clashed with the local Catholic archdiocese by opposing the settlement of Syrian refugees in Indianapolis. Pence was also slammed for the planned 2015 launch of \"JustIN,\" a state-operated news service that was ditched after critics panned it as \"Pravda on the Plains.\" But he has also presided over Indiana's improving economy and plummeting unemployment rate, which Republicans credit to the state's low taxes, limited regulation and pro-business climate. ___ What political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

Sign up\u00a0here.** TRUMP\u2019S MIDNIGHT IN AMERICA SPEECHCLEVELAND \u2013 Speaking to the country at what he said was \u201ca moment of crisis for our nation,\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took his audience on a tour of a dark and dangerous America teetering at the brink. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Trump said. But we do have one hope: Electing him before it\u2019s too late. Trump vowed to break through the \u201ccarefully-crafted lies and the media myths\u201d that portray America as a safe, peaceful and prosperous country. The truth, Trump said, is that urban crime, terrorism, illegal immigration and unfair trade deals \u201cthreaten our very way of life.\u201d We\u2019ve had \u201cmorning in America,\u201d but as one attendee at the Quicken Loans Arena observed, Trump was talking about the nation at midnight. What made Trump\u2019s description of \u201cpoverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad\u201d even more ominous was that the true extent of the danger is being hidden. He said powerful interests are conspiring against ordinary Americans to not only perpetuate the problems for the benefit of the elite, but also to hide the extent of the calamity. Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cignored, neglected and abandoned\u201d average Americans was that he, as a master manipulator of the \u201crigged\u201d system, would be their advocate. \u201cI am your voice!\u201d was his repeated war cry as Trump vowed to do battle against the claque of international corporations and their political puppets who he said are intentionally allowing criminals, terrorists and immigrants to destroy the country and it\u2019s once prosperous middle class. \u201cNobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,\u201d Trump said. America has become Gotham City and Trump is ready to stop being billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and start being Batman. The solutions Trump offered could hardly be unpopular given that the burden fell only on the wicked. What person would oppose peace, prosperity, patriotism and \u201claw and order?\u201d What remains to be seen is whether enough voters agree with his depiction of the world. If you are a voter who believes that things are off course in America and need to be fixed this was not the speech for you. If you believe that it is 1968 all over again, then this was your candidate. This is in part a reflection of the growing dominance of social media and of Trump as its candidate. In the world of 2016, your vision of America can be carefully curated to meet your assumptions of the state of the union as dire or recovering. A Facebook homepage or Twitter feed can be pruned to affirm either world view. In Philadelphia next week, Democrats will create an alternate reality in which things are good but not great and only one more election away from bursting forth with prosperity and harmony for the land. Hillary Clinton wants you to believe that we are almost there. Trump wants you to believe that it\u2019s almost over. Most persuadable voters probably don\u2019t belong in either of these two camps. Trump\u2019s challenge, on which he made a hefty down payment Thursday, is to convince more people that things are worse than they think. Clinton\u2019s own onerous task is to make them believe that things are better than they really are. The backdrop for this pitched battle between a final hope in the face of oblivion and a technocratic nudge towards modest improvement is the endless character assaults between the two candidates. Clinton and Trump each say the other is unfit for office. But for Trump, Clinton is merely a symptom of the larger conspiracy against his voters. She is \u201ca puppet,\u201d not a supervillain. The end is near and she is just the final push that America needs to tumble over the cliff. For Clinton, Trump himself is the crisis. Her predictable warning next week will likely be that his wicked reign would put the world at risk. She will tell you that Trump is not Batman, but rather The Joker. Whatever you think of her, Democrats will argue, she is the nation\u2019s last hope to stop Trump from taking power and bringing chaos. Neither Trump nor Clinton is running as the candidate you like. They each want to be the candidate you\u2019re afraid not to vote for.

Trippi and Stirewalt break it down on our final day in Cleveland. WATCH HERE. THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: WHAT IF THE FIX WAS IN? Fox News\u2019 Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks what if the fix for Hillary Clinton was in at the Department of Justice from the start: \u201cWhat if the Department of Political Justice never subpoenaed anything from Clinton? What if it never convened a grand jury to seek and hear evidence against her? What if the FBI requires a grand jury to subpoena documents and tangible things? What if it is highly irregular for a major FBI criminal investigation to be undertaken without a grand jury?\u201d BUT THE LOCAL TACO BELL IS KILLIN\u2019 IT Denver Post: \u201c[The town of Hugo] on Colorado\u2019s Eastern Plains warned\u00a0its residents not to drink, bathe in or cook with its tap water on Thursday because officials said multiple preliminary tests of the water came back positive for\u00a0THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. Residents were told not even to let their pets drink the water. There have been no reports of illnesses or any symptoms of impairment from drinking the water, officials said at a news conference Thursday evening. Deeper tests, which could be completed Friday, are needed to verify the presence of THC and to determine the level of contamination, if any.\u201d Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Sally Persons\u00a0contributed to this report.

In 2008, Clinton wasn\u2019t even a supporter of the mainstream Democratic position of allowing illegal immigrants to have driver\u2019s licenses. Now she is ready to go for a full amnesty. USA Today reports that Clinton is embracing President Obama\u2019s immigration policy and campaign style today: \u201cShe will chat with Rancho High School students who are DREAMers, the term used for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\u201d [Stephen Dinan points out that Clinton isn\u2019t just reversing herself, but the tough immigration policies put forward by her husband.] This latest reversal follows Clinton flips on tough-on-crime drug laws and gay marriage. Presumably more will follow. Remember that this is the woman whose former fellow cabinet member Robert Gates said admitted opposing the Iraq surge to win support among anti-war Democrats. Despite a new poll that shows that a stout majority of Democrats think a Clinton coronation will be just fine, she\u2019s not taking any chances this time, either. One supposes that the major threat for Clinton now is not an external foe but the ongoing self-destruct sequence as the campaign tries and fails to put to rest mounting allegations of corruption against the candidate and her family. The same poll from the WSJ and NBC News that shows Democrats taking a submissive posture shows Clinton crashing with the general electorate. She\u2019s seen as untrustworthy by a 2-to-1 ratio.RUBIO ROCKET RIDE CONTINUES, WALKER HAS ROOM TO GROW The same WSJ/NBC News poll shows Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continuing his post announcement surge. As Republicans increasingly tune in to the wide-open race, Rubio may trail bush by 5 points, but his 41 percent combined first and second choice is very impressive. He\u2019s drawing from two wings of the party while Jeb Bush\u2019s support remains in an establishment Republican stovepipe. Everyone knows him and most don\u2019t like him. But Scott Walker is hovering in deep water waiting for his moment. While Rubio is well known from his time in the Senate and frequent national television appearances, Walker still has very low name identification, even among Republicans. He\u2019s in third place, but 21 percent of GOP primary voters don\u2019t even know his name compared to 9 percent for Rubio and 1 percent for Bush. Those that know him seem to like him and he has not yet announced. Walker, as Bush might say, has a right to rise.Jeb\u2019s wife, son head to Chicago - Chicago Sun-Times: \u201cThe wife and son of all but declared presidential hopeful Jeb Bush hit Chicago on Thursday for a fundraiser where the ask ranges from $2,500 for one ticket to $250,000 to give or raise. The money is for the Bush super pac, \u2018Right to Rise,\u2019 which is underwriting the initial stages of the former Florida governor\u2019s 2016 presidential run. The headliners for the Chicago event are Columba Bush and Jeb Bush Jr. who will appear at a luncheon at the Union League Club\u2026\u201dRubio to speak at annual Florida GOP dinner, no invite to Jeb yet - Miami Herald: \u201cDon\u2019t expect the Miami-Dade Republican Party to take sides in the 2016 presidential primary. But the GOP is giving contender Marco Rubio top billing at its Lincoln Day Dinner in June. There's no mention of the other likely candidate from Miami, Jeb Bush, on the party's invitation. Rubio will be the keynote speaker for the June 20 event, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera listed as a \u2018special guest.\u2019 Lopez-Cantera, a close Rubio friend, could jump into the U.S. Senate race to replace him.\u201d [Rubio will deliver his first policy speech as a presidential candidate in on May 13. He will address the Council on Foreign Relations in New York to outline his national security framework.]Walker scorches Obama, Clinton on Islamist threat - The Hill: \u201c[Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker] said he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d that Clinton spent four years as Obama\u2019s closest advisor on foreign policy matters. \u201cWe need a president for this country who will look the American people in the eye and have the courage to tell them the truth,\u201d Walker boomed. \u201cIt could be a day, a week, a month or a year, but we know it\u2019s not a question of if there will be another attempt on American soil, it\u2019s question of when there will be another attempt on American soil\u2026and I\u2019d rather take the fight to them than let them bring the fight to us.\u201d \u2026 \u201cNow more than ever America needs a commander-in-chief that will stand up and declare radical Islam is a threat to us all,\u201d he said to a standing ovation. \u201cWe need a president who identified for once and for all that Israel is an ally and actually starts acting like it.\u201dRand advocates for racial fairness in drug laws - Detroit Free-Press: \u201cU.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky drew loud applause in the heart of western Michigan Monday when he delivered a key plank of his Republican presidential campaign - that the nation's drug policy is disproportionately putting blacks behind bars. Paul delivered a similar message when he opened a GOP office in Detroit in December of 2013.\u201dWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Ever marveled at those nighttime satellite views that show a dark North Korea while an electrified South Korea glows with lights? Slate invites you to take a gander at a 1910 map of the 5.8 million places in the U.S. where you could place a call via the Bell Telephone System. \u201cBy the time this map was printed, Bell had tried several different strategies, clean and dirty, to fight back against its competition\u2026Theodore N. Vail, who took over in 1907, changed strategies, accepting limited government regulation while buying competitors or bringing them into the Bell system\u2026. Some rural areas\u2014Oklahoma, Iowa, northern and eastern Texas\u2014are surprisingly well-covered, while others in the Southeast remain empty. The discrepancy between coverage in the East and the West is perhaps the most striking aspect of the map.

The former governor of Arkansas is a populist favorite, but that does not mean he will have an easy time cracking into the top tier. A new WSJ/NBC News poll shows Huckabee in sixth place among GOP presidential hopefuls, trailing Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, by 5 points. Both have the same aim: to unite tea party and evangelical voters. Huckabee\u2019s challenge, both nationally and in the conservative crucible of the Iowa caucuses, is to change perceptions of himself and his candidacy \u2013 to remind voters that he can be a fighter and a champion for social conservatives and blue-collar voters. With Cruz\u2019s high profile and deep pockets, he and Huckabee are set up for a duel across Iowa\u2019s 99 counties for the support of true believers.Huckabee vital statistics* 59 years old, born in Hope, Ark. * Parents Mae and Dorsey Wiles Huckabee* Ouachita Baptist University, B.A. 1975 * Lost bid to unseat Sen.

Carson does worse with 36 percent not knowing who he is, but 22 percent certain they wouldn\u2019t vote for him. \u201cI have lived all over the world, traveled and worked all over the world. And I know that it is only in the United States of America that a young woman can start as a secretary and go on to become the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world. That is only possible here.\u201d- Carly Fiorina on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201dIowans skeptical of Carson - Des Moines Register: \u201cIowans who have heard of Ben Carson know the broad strokes about his life\u2026But they\u2019re less certain about where he stands on important issues, or if there\u2019s an avenue for victory for him in Iowa...On Tuesday, Carson intends to hit the campaign trail hard, with several public and private events in Iowa\u2026Expect Carson\u2019s message about opportunity to draw the most diverse audiences of any Republican contender in the race, his Iowa strategist, Ryan Rhodes, said.\u201d [Carson resumes his Iowa schedule after cancelling events to spend time with his ailing mother. Today, Carson has a town hall meeting with Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa.]He\u2019s going to Jackson - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie heads to Jackson, Miss. and Baton Rouge, La. meet and greets today on behalf of his super PAC. Given thenews back home, Christie probably could use a little Southern hospitality.SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX\u201cKasich came out strong and ready on Sunday, elevating him to the top spot for me.\u00a0 Likewise, Carly Fiorina, comes over as a strong contender, although not for number 1.\u00a0 Kasich and Fiorina in 2016 will win it.\u201d \u2013 Charlie McCartan\u201cOnly ONE (\u2018potential\u2019) candidate has served as a Governor of a large state, AND is the ONLY one to have served in the Armed Forces of the United States, as far as I know - Governor Rick Perry. We need someone who has run a government (Texas for 14 years) and has a strong understanding of what it will take to solve our national security problems.\u00a0 Remember how Gov. Perry handled the border issue when Obama wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u2013 Doug Mathes\u201cDemocrats have got to be confused. Running for President as Republicans are a woman, an African-American, and two Hispanics, constituencies which are supposed to belong to the Democrat Party. Maybe the Republican Party is more \u2018big tent\u2019 than some would have us believe.\u201d\u2013\u00a0Mary HellerDECISION TIME FOR MCCONNELL ON IRAN NUKE BILLThe bill giving Congress the power to review a nuclear deal with Iran is at a critical stage in the Senate as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides whether to shut down debate on the measure, The Hill reports. \u201cMcConnell \u00a0is seeking an agreement to allow votes on several controversial amendments backed by conservatives that supporters of the bill say would kill it\u2026The full [Republican] conference is expected to talk about the Iran bill at their Tuesday lunch\u2026.[S]ome Republicans predicted McConnell may have no choice but to file cloture to end debate\u2026While this could anger conservatives, it would also save a carefully crafted compromise drawn up by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and reluctantly endorsed by the White House.\u201dReid threatens Obama trade pact - Minority leader Harry Reid says Senate Democrats will block Senate consideration of President Obama\u2019s top trade priority until a transportation funding measure and reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are passed first. Reid, who has been openly opposed to the president\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership authority, told HuffPo he\u2019s confident Democrats will stick together on the demand. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not willing to lay over and play dead on trade until we have some commitment from them on surface transportation,\u2019 he said. The same goes for FISA, he said.\u201dNo hot towels - The Hill: \u201cA bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to prevent members of Congress from using official funds for first-class airfare. Reps. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) said that luxury air travel is \u2018especially wasteful\u2019 while Congress has yet to eliminate the federal deficit\u2026.The\u00a0bill from Gosar and Ruiz, titled the Coach-Only Airfare for Capitol Hill (COACH) Act, would mandate that lawmakers and staffers can only fly first-class with personal funds\u2026.\u201dGO SOAK YOUR HEADHowever annoying last year\u2019s \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d was for you, it\u2019s nothing compared to the experience of one California police officer who finds herself, ahem, in hot water. AP reports: \u201cLos Angeles County prosecutors say a video posted online in July showed Pasadena police officer Jaime Robison pick up a 5-gallon bucket of ice water and pour it over a fellow officer while she was receiving disability benefits. The case also alleges the 39-year-old Robison exaggerated injuries in 2012 to receive disability pay. Robison pleaded not guilty Friday to four counts of insurance fraud. She is scheduled to return to court June 10. If convicted, she could face up to six years and four months in jail.\u201dAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201c[Ben Carson] does not speak like a politician. But I think he is.\u00a0 This is really hard to\u00a0do what he is trying to do. And I think the reason he stumbled in last few months over certain\u00a0issues is\u00a0because it is really hard to go from being a top college player to being only not only in\u00a0the major leagues but immediately in the world series.

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from Florida With less than two weeks to go, the race for the White House has narrowed as Hillary Clinton now has a three-point advantage over Donald Trump. That\u2019s within the margin of error of the national Fox News Poll of likely voters. Clinton is ahead of Trump by 44-41 percent. \u00a0Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided. \u00a0Last week she was up by six points (45-39 percent) and before that by seven (45-38 percent). The poll, released Wednesday, finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup. \u00a0That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin. \u00a0She was up 7 a week ago (49-42 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS. Trump is helped by increased backing among independents and greater strength of support: 68 percent of those backing Trump support him \u201cstrongly,\u201d compared to 61 percent for Clinton. Independents favor Trump over Clinton by 13 points (41-28 percent). \u00a0He had a 7-point advantage last week, and two weeks ago they were tied at 35 percent each. \u00a0Third-party candidates play a role here, as Gary Johnson (14 percent) and Jill Stein (7 percent) receive the combined support of more than one-in-five independents. In the four-way race, Trump leads among whites (+14 points) and men (+5), although his best groups remain white evangelical Christians (+56) and whites without a college degree (+28). Clinton has commanding leads among blacks (+77 points), unmarried women (+27), voters under 30 (+18), and women (+10). \u00a0First-time voters are also more likely to back her (+16). The candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful: \u00a083 percent of Democrats back Clinton, while 81 percent of Republicans support Trump. \u201cTo be competitive, Trump needs to consolidate support among Republicans and carry independents,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s made in-roads in the last week, mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and Obamacare.\u201d \u00a0 Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson. Trump\u2019s substantive strength is the economy. \u00a0He\u2019s trusted over Clinton by four points, yet that\u2019s the only issue where he bests her. \u00a0More trust Clinton to handle foreign policy (+15 points), immigration (+3), and terrorism (+3). Who would voters put across the table with Russian President Vladimir Putin? \u00a0More trust Clinton to negotiate with Putin by 3 points (47-44 percent among registered voters). \u00a0That\u2019s down from a 13-point lead on this measure in April (53-40 percent). All in all, likely voters don\u2019t think Trump is up to the task: \u00a0less than half think he\u2019s qualified to be president (46 percent) and even fewer feel he has the temperament to serve effectively (36 percent). \u00a0Plus, over half lack confidence in his judgment in a crisis (56 percent). Clinton trounces Trump on each of those measures: \u00a064 percent believe she\u2019s qualified, 62 percent say she has the temperament, and 56 percent are confident in her judgment. Plus, Clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings. \u00a0She has a net negative rating of eight points (45 favorable vs. 53 unfavorable), while Trump is underwater by 14 (42 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable). \u00a0In addition, when undecided voters and those backing third-party candidates are combined, 26 percent have a favorable view of Clinton vs. 18 percent for Trump. Yet despite Trump\u2019s weaknesses on traits, it\u2019s still a tight race. \u00a0That\u2019s because, at least in part, lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote. \u00a0By a 59-28 percent margin, more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates. \u00a0Those backing Trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57-point margin (73-16 percent). \u00a0For Clinton supporters, the choice is more about issues by 12 points (47-35 percent). Compared to 2008, this is a more character driven election. \u00a0At that time, voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 71-14 percent margin. \"The bottom hasn't fallen out for Trump and Clinton hasn't pulled away, but the race isn\u2019t as close as the 3-point lead suggests,\u201d says Anderson. \u00a0\u201cTrump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of third-party candidates, and that\u2019s extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment, temperament, and qualifications to be president.\" There are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched. \u00a0First, 52 percent feel Clinton \u201cstands up\u201d for people like them, and 49 percent feel that way about Trump. Also on their honesty -- or lack thereof: \u00a0a record-low 30 percent of likely voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 34 percent say Trump is. Pollpourri Here are five additional takeaways from the poll. - 63 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters believe things in the United States generally favor \u201cother people,\u201d rather than people like them. \u00a0Forty-four percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters feel that way. - Twice as many voters expect Clinton to win as think Trump will (64-26 percent). \u00a0Fully 86 percent of Democrats think Clinton will win, while 49 percent of Republicans think Trump will. - Trump supporters (34 percent) are more than three times as likely as Clinton supporters (10 percent) to say they won\u2019t accept the election outcome if their candidate loses. \u00a0Eighty-eight percent of Clinton supporters say they\u2019ll accept the outcome, up from 74 percent in September. - The generic congressional ballot test is also tight: \u00a047 percent back the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, while 45 percent support the Republican. \u00a0Among those backing the GOP congressional candidate, 79 percent go for Trump in the four-way presidential race. \u00a0Clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the Democratic candidate. \u201cModels suggest a 2-point Democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the House and 4 in the Senate,\u201d says Shaw. \u00a0\u201cThat means the GOP would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the House, while the Senate would be very much up for grabs.\u201d - The political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters. \u00a0The Democratic Party has a net positive rating of four points (51 percent favorable vs. 47 percent unfavorable). \u00a0The Republican Party has a net negative rating by just one point (48 percent favorable vs. 49 percent unfavorable). The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-25, 2016.\u00a0 The survey includes results among 1,221 likely voters.\u00a0 The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Big break in IRS case will change scandal\u2019s course \u2022 Administration blames Iraq losses on bad intel \u2022 Sorry, not sorry: Hillary says she \u2018worked hard\u2019 for $155 million haul \u2022 First in Fox News First: Alexander challenger opens with amnesty attack \u2022 It\u2019s not delinquency, it\u2019s job training BIG BREAK IN IRS CASE WILL CHANGE SCANDAL\u2019S COURSENew evidence about the actions of the IRS official at the center of the investigation into the agency\u2019s systematic targeting of President Obama\u2019s political adversaries is intensifying the firestorm over the alleged corruption. IRS executive Lois Lerner apparently pushed for an audit of one of the administration\u2019s most outspoken critics in the Senate. In emails with a colleague, Lerner claims to have mistakenly received an invitation to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to give a speech to a non-profit group in 2012. Lerner wrote that the group offered to pay for Grassley\u2019s wife to attend. Lerner wanted to sic investigators on Grassley, even though, as her colleague observed, the offer was not improper. How did Lerner, a then-unknown IRS division manager, end up with a speaking invitation to an Iowa Republican Senator? We can\u2019t know because Lerner refuses to testify. What other notable Republican did she suggest be targeted? We can\u2019t find out because the agency \u201crecycled\u201d the hard drives that the IRS says include her sent items from the key period of the targeting. But what we do know is: Pushing for the selective prosecution of a high-profile administration adversary in the Senate is a big deal and will change the way this case moves forward. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her in jail, we want the truth. We want the truth more than anything else...\u201d \u2013 House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif. on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d making his first-ever demand for a special prosecutor into the targeting of the president\u2019s political enemies. Watch the full interview here. Game changer - The good news for the administration is that this revelation makes it easier to sell the narrative that Lerner was the source of the corruption and that her removal was curative. This is fuel for the bus the White House is trying to throw Lerner under. The bad news for the administration is that the revelation of a rank, partisan abuse like this one, especially aimed at the legislative branch, may break the dam of resistance to an outside investigation. Coming on the heels of the admission that the agency had trashed evidence in the case, Democrats will feel increasing pressure to demand more than the apparently stalled internal investigation in the administration. Remember, outrage in the Senate over domestic spying didn\u2019t get really hot until it was revealed that lawmakers themselves were targets. A special prosecutor is the only way out. EPA admits to destroying evidence - Fox News: \u201cEnvironmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy on Wednesday cited a similar cyber snafu during a House Oversight Committee hearing. \u2018Another missing hard drive?\u2019 Rep. Mark Meadows, R-NC, asked McCarthy. She responded, \u2018We are having trouble acquiring the data.\u2019 Wednesday\u2019s hearing was called in response to allegations of rampant employee misconduct as well as a pattern of obstruction of oversight efforts by the committee.\u201d [Gross, dude - GovExec: \u201cEPA Employees Told to Stop Pooping in the Hallway\u201d] BOEHNER HAS A PEN TOO: PROCEEDS WITH SUIT TO BLOCK OBAMA EXEC ACTIONSFox News: \u201cHouse Speaker John Boehner announced Wednesday he plans to file suit against President Obama over his alleged abuse of executive power. \u2018This is not about impeachment -- it\u2019s about him faithfully executing the laws of this country,\u2019 Boehner said. The speaker alleged that the president not only has ignored the law but \u2018brags about it,\u2019 decrying what he described as \u2018arrogance and incompetence.\u2019 Boehner had been weighing such a lawsuit in recent days, over concerns that Obama exceeded his constitutional authority with executive actions. Republicans have voiced frustration with Obama\u2019s second-term \u2018pen and phone\u2019 strategy of pursuing policy changes without Congress -- particularly environmental rules via the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans also complained about numerous unilateral changes to the implementation of ObamaCare.\u201d Affects immigration \u2013 Washington Examiner: \u201cWith immigration stalled in the House, President Obama is widely expected to use executive orders to change how the U.S. handles undocumented immigrants sometime this fall\u2026. But the lawsuit gives Republicans the chance to argue that anything Obama does this fall on immigration is a potential abuse of power and remains in legal limbo.\u201d ADMINISTRATION BLAMES IRAQ LOSSES ON BAD INTELAs Islamist militants took yet another Iraqi town today, this one home to four natural gas fields an hour\u2019s drive from Baghdad, the Obama administration\u2019s defense to foreign policy critics is to claim ignorance, telling members of Congress that they never saw the incursion coming because of limited intelligence. The reason? AP: \u201cIraq is emblematic of how a security-conscious CIA is finding it difficult to spy aggressively in dangerous environments without military protection\u2026 current and former U.S. officials say. Intelligence blind spots have left the U.S. behind the curve on fast-moving world events, they say, whether it\u2019s disintegration in Iraq, Russia\u2019s move into Crimea or the collapse of several governments during the Arab Spring\u2026.\u201d [\u201cThis is the result of indecision\u2026which is a policy failure.

Better Get a Warrant,\u201d The Atlantic\u2019s Garrett Epps examines Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court decision: \u201cCell phones, [Chief Justice John Roberts wrote], \u2018could just as easily be called cameras, video players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.\u2019 They carry a full history of the owner\u2019s recent life\u2014who the owner has emailed or texted and what was said; where the owner has been and how many times; bank records and health information; and even \u2018apps for improving your romantic life.\u2019 If the arrest exception is stretched to cover smartphones, it might permit searches that would \u2018expose to the government far\u00a0more\u00a0than the exhaustive search of a house.\u2019\u2026 \u2018Absent more precise guidance from the founding era,\u2019 Roberts wrote, the case must be decided by balancing the severity of the government intrusion against \u2018the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 \u2018We cannot deny that our decision today will have an impact on the ability of law enforcement to combat crime,\u2019 Roberts wrote at the close of his opinion. \u2018Privacy comes at a cost.\u2019 It seems likely, however, that day-to-day law enforcement can take the decision in stride, as he noted: \u2018Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple\u2014get a warrant.\u201d Roberts wrote that that in some places \u2018police officers can e-mail warrant requests to judges\u2019 iPads [and] judges have signed such warrants and e-mailed them back to officers in less than 15 minutes.\u2019\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Appearing on the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d Clinton was asked about her claims that the family was \u201cdead broke\u201d or that their estimated $155 million haul since 2001did not leave them \u201ctruly well off.\u201d Clinton attributed the firestorm to poor word choice: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said the five or so words that I said, but my inartful use of those few words doesn\u2019t change who I am,\u201d she said. But Clinton, who has made her enormous wealth from her celebrity status and close corporate connections, especially on Wall Street, remained adamant that the astonishing income came because she and her husband \u201chave worked hard.\u201d Clinton acknowledged that they are making an average of $12 million a year , but \u2018we\u2019ve been grateful for everything that we\u2019ve been able to achieve, and sadly that's just not true for most Americans today.\u2019\u201d Bubba\u2019s bling - Daily Caller: \u201cOne day after Bill Clinton insisted his family\u2019s wealth doesn\u2019t make him or Hillary \u2018out of touch\u2019 with regular people\u2019s economic reality, the former president found himself happily recounting the 14 expensive Swiss watches and \u201ctwo rugs\u201d he bought to hand out to friends.

Thad Cochran\u2019s 6,373-vote win on Tuesday. Under Mississippi election law, primary voters must promise to support the same party\u2019s nominee in the fall. Even though the provision was ruled unenforceable, McDaniel may still push onward. \u201cIf our party and our conservative movement are to co-exist, it is paramount that we ensure the sanctity of the election process is upheld,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAnd we will do that\u2026we must be absolutely certain that our Republican primary was won by Republican voters.\u201d Activists continue to support the state senator urging McDaniel to launch a write-in campaign. Childers ready to reap benefits - Cochran\u2019s Democratic challenger, former Rep. Travis Childers, is surely hoping for the Republican fratricide to last as long as possible, ideally ending in a write-in candidacy for the primary loser. Although many Democrats voted for Cochran Tuesday, Childers told WDAM, \u201cI think in November, those Democrats will be back with me.\u201d [George Will dissects the Mississippi race in \u201cMississippi Republicans vote their appetite\u201d: \u201cMcDaniel\u2019s defeat, like many the tea party has experienced this primary season, brings that feisty faction face to face with a melancholy fact: Americans\u2019 devotion to frugal government is frequently avowed but rarely inhibiting. If the nation\u2019s trajectory is to be changed, this will not be done as abruptly as tea partyers wish, and it will not be done without their continued wholesome agitation.\u201d] FIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: ALEXANDER CHALLENGER OPENS WITH AMNESTY ATTACKTennessee Senate hopeful Joe Carr\u2019s first TV ad of this year will hit airwaves today. In the 30-second spot, the state senator from outside Nashville attacks incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., for an influx of illegal aliens crossing the border. \u201cPresident Obama created this crisis only after Lamar Alexander voted for amnesty. He is responsible,\u201d Carr says. \u201cLike you, I opposed amnesty and believe in the rule of law. I\u2019ve written and passed some of the toughest illegal immigration laws in the country.\u201d\u00a0 Carr challenges Alexander in another test of the GOP establishment in the Aug. 7 primary. ROBERTS LEADS TEA PARTY INSURGENTA new KSN News poll shows Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, leading against physician Milton Wolf, 56 percent to 23 percent. Wolf challenges Roberts from the right. After House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s surprising loss, Wolf rallied his base saying Cantor is an example of disapproval of the GOP establishment. The Kansans face-off in an Aug. 5 primary.CONSERVATIVE ADVOCACY GROUP SLAMS UDALL FOR HIGH SPENDINGConservative youth advocacy group Generation Opportunity released two new ads Wednesday attacking Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. for spending tactics that the group says are hurting younger Americans.\u00a0One ad, comparing the senator\u2019s spending to a grocery trip, is nearly identical to an ad slamming Sen. Mary Landieu, D-La. released last week. Republican Rep. Cory Gardner is challenging Udall. GENERIC BALLOT TIED, BUT GOP HAS INTENSITY EDGEPolling maven Dana Blanton writes up the latest Fox News poll: \u201cIf the congressional election were \u2018held today,\u2019 42 percent of voters would support the Democratic candidate in their district, while 42 percent would back the Republican.\u00a0 Another 13 percent aren\u2019t sure for whom they\u2019d cast their ballot. \u2026 One election advantage for the GOP is that 66 percent of Republicans are at least \u201cvery\u201d interested in the midterms, while just 54 percent of Democrats feel the same. Moreover, 35 percent of Republicans are \u201cextremely\u201d interested compared to 24 percent of Democrats.\u201dPICK SIXRepublicans have their sights set on six seats to win back control of the Senate from Democrats.

            "article_content": "This split shows Hillary Clinton, left, and Donald Trump, right. (AP) If you're reading this, you've survived the 2016 presidential race \u2013 through all its heart-stopping twists and turns. As the vote gets underway Tuesday, FoxNews.com looks\u00a0back on the memorable moments that have made this the most unusual, unpredictable White House battle in modern American history. Hillary Clinton email scandal erupts The first campaign bombshell came in March 2015, when the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that Hillary Clinton -- then, not even an announced candidate -- had exclusively used a private email server, located at her New York home, when serving as secretary of state. The bombshell sent shockwaves through the media, Congress and the country at large, and the issue would dog Clinton throughout both the primaries and general election cycle. Shortly before the party convention, FBI Director James Comey in early July\u00a0announced\u00a0that while Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in the handling of classified information, the agency did not recommend charges. That seemed to be the end of it, but there was still one more twist to the tale ... Donald Trump announces his candidacy It all began with a slow escalator ride at Trump Tower. On June 26, 2015, the billionaire announced his longshot anti-establishment candidacy with a searing speech remembered most famously for his so-called \u201cMexican rapist\u201d line \u2013 in which he accused Mexico of sending bad people across the border. \u201cThey're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\u201d he said, in remarks that would kick off his unconventional campaign. Most analysts gave Trump little chance of winning the nomination, believing he would be crushed underfoot by the likes of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. But the Trump Train proved much sturdier than many imagined. Sparks fly at GOP primary debates as Democrats bury theirs The primary debates, particularly on the Republican side, were some of the most fiery in recent history \u2013 with unusual two-tier debates being set up due to the number of candidates in the race. At the debates themselves, all eyes were on Trump, and he didn't disappoint. Sparks flew as Trump beat up on \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb, took shots at Rosie O\u2019Donnell and fought back against claims he had small hands by making a reference to his genitals -- and even boycotted one of the debates in order to hold his own veterans fundraiser. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, wounded his own candidacy by repeating the same talking point three times at one debate. On the Democratic side, there seemed to be very little interest in holding debates, as the DNC scheduled several on weekends and around the same time as top NFL games. Bernie Sanders surges When self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in April 2015, few gave him much of a chance against the Clinton campaign behemoth. But as the other rivals \u2013 former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb \u2013 fell by the wayside, Bernie remained and picked up momentum as young people in particular started to \u201cFeel The Bern.\u201d Despite winning states such as Michigan, Colorado and New Hampshire and hitting Clinton hard on issues like her speeches to Goldman Sachs, he was eventually defeated, but on the way inspired a movement of young people, and gave the former secretary of state somewhat of a scare. Debbie Wasserman Schultz steps down On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, then-Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to announce she would step down after emails released by WikiLeaks appeared to show discussions by DNC staff to help Clinton at the expense of her primary rivals. The scandal infuriated Sanders supporters, gave red meat to Trump's claim that the process was \"rigged\" and threatened to undercut the DNC\u2019s show of unity at their convention. Quickly, Wasserman Schultz was replaced by interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, who herself would come under fire after emails showed her appearing to leak primary debate questions to the Clinton campaign. Cruz stuns GOP convention audience Trump\u2019s main primary rival Ted Cruz shocked the Republican National Convention by refusing to endorse the nominee in his speech in Cleveland, telling voters to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d in November, to boos from delegates. Cruz would later go on to endorse Trump, much to the dismay of many of Cruz\u2019s supporters who had previously applauded his stance at the convention. Clinton stumbles, is dragged into a van on 9/11 Rumbling questions over Hillary Clinton\u2019s health erupted on Sept. 11 when Clinton was forced to leave a 9/11 remembrance service early after reportedly feeling ill. Video emerged of Clinton stumbling and being carried by aides into a black van, fueling the rumors about Clinton\u2019s fitness for office. The campaign later revealed the former secretary of state was suffering from pneumonia, as Clinton also suffered in the polls in the days after the health scare. Leak of Trump tax records Trump has continually come under fire for refusing to release his tax returns. In October, an unnamed source took the liberty of mailing Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records to a New York Times reporter. The records showed that the billionaire declared a $916 million loss -- so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. The release only increased the calls for Trump to release his tax returns \u2013 yet Trump still refused to play ball, saying he couldn\u2019t release them as he is being audited. 2005 tape reveals Trump's sexual remarks In October, a 2005 tape of Trump making sexually crude comments on an \"Access Hollywood\" shoot was leaked to The Washington Post, raising again questions about Trump\u2019s language toward women. The video captured Trump on a hot mic talking to Billy Bush on a bus about groping and kissing women, saying \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it ... You can do anything.\u201d The tape forced Trump into a rare apology, and damaged his standing in the polls. It also led to a number of women coming forward to accuse the billionaire of having sexually assaulted or harassed them in the past. He denied it. WikiLeaks dumps thousands of Podesta emails In the second big phase of their leaks, WikiLeaks in October began an almost daily leak of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails. The emails led to a constant drip drip of negative stories about the campaign, and gave raw insight into the internal goings-on of the campaign. Stories included the leaking of questions to the Clinton campaign by Donna Brazile, negative remarks about Catholics by Clinton staffers, criticism of Clinton by key allies, and\u00a0coordination with the State Department. Trump says he may not accept the election results In the final presidential debate, Trump raised eyebrows once again by saying he would not necessarily accept the results of the general election. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense,\u201d Trump said when asked by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace. He later clarified that he was reserving his right to challenge a \u201cquestionable result.\u201d He also teased the media by promising an announcement the day after the debate, then saying he\u00a0would\u00a0accept the results,\u00a0before clarifying, \u201cIf I win,\u201d to the delight of his supporters in Delaware, Ohio. Clinton email scandal 2.0 The 2016 October surprise came at the very end of the month, when FBI Director James Comey announced in October that the bureau was revisiting the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she served as secretary of state. The decision came after the FBI found new emails on the computer of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner \u2013 the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. #DonaldTrump announces #FBI reopening its investigation into #HillaryClinton's private email server as his supporters chant, \"Lock her up!\" pic.twitter.com/rgmDbn2xrI The announcement put Clinton\u2019s lead in doubt and energized the Trump campaign, yet two days before the election Comey announced that the new review of the emails hadn't changed the agency's July opinion.",

            "article_content": "A group backed by the New York hedge fund billionaire George Soros, a longtime bankroller of liberal political causes, is mailing anti-Joe Arpaio fliers to Phoenix-area voters shown here, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) PHOENIX \u2013 Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America who could face criminal charges for ignoring a judge's order to stop targeting Latinos in anti-immigration roundups, may now have a new foe as he seeks re-election \u2014 George Soros, the billionaire liberal hedge fund tycoon. The Republican sheriff already was battered politically and support for him had been slipping when a group linked to Soros mounted an anti-Arpaio attack in an attempt to weaken his bid for a seventh straight term. The group started sending fliers to Phoenix-area voters two weeks ago, and a mailing last week accuses Arpaio of separating a mother from her child because of an unpaid traffic ticket, botching hundreds of sex crimes investigations and scaring immigrants so much that that they don't report crime. Arpaio denies the claims and is easily capable of striking back with a formidable $2.9 million still available for campaign spending ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, dwarfing the total $326,000 raised by his challenger, Democrat Paul Penzone, a former Phoenix police sergeant who lost to Arpaio by 6 percentage points in 2012. But the entry of a Soros-linked group is a gift for Penzone, who acknowledges he'll never come close to matching Arpaio's campaign spending. Over the last year, Soros contributed $3.9 million to Democrats in law enforcement political races in Chicago, St. Louis, Orlando, Houston, Albuquerque, Lowndes County in Mississippi and Caddo Parish in Louisiana, according to campaign finance records. Of the seven district attorney candidates Soros-linked groups have backed, two have already been elected and four won primaries. Only one lost. In New Mexico, Soros gave $107,000 to Raul Torrez, the winner of the Democrat primary in June for the county that encompasses Albuquerque \u2014 prompting Republican Simon Kubiak to drop out. Kubiak said he guaranteed Torrez victory because he could not raise the money he would have needed to counterattack and because he feared a barrage of negative ads. \"I would have accepted it, too,\" Kubiak said of Soros' donation to Torrez. Officials with the billionaire's Soros Fund Management referred comment on Soros' political donations to Michael Vachon, a top Soros adviser who serves as his personal spokesman. Vachon did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The new anti-Arpaio group, Maricopa Strong, registered in Arizona on Aug. 29, the day before Arpaio won his Republican primary against three opponents. It is not required to file a report detailing who made donations and spending until Sept. 29. But county records state Maricopa Strong's chairwoman is Whitney Tymas, a former public defense attorney in New York and Virginia prosecutor who serves as treasurer for the Soros-funded Safety & Justice national political committee and groups with similar names in Illinois, Florida, Texas and New Mexico. Tymas did not respond to repeated phone and email messages seeking comment, and Maricopa Strong spokeswoman Tania Torres did not respond when asked by telephone and email if Soros had provided the group with funding. The tenor of the ads shown for various local races and past positions by Soros-backed groups indicate he's focused on reducing perceived racial disparities within the criminal justice system. His super political action committee gave more than $14 million from 2015-16, including big sums to organizations trying to elect Hillary Clinton. The anti-Arpaio flier accuses him of being \"obsessed with immigrants at the expense of his job\" and of making \"immigrant communities scared to report crime for fear they will be harassed by the Sheriff's Office.\" The 84-year-old Arpaio has denied he is anti-immigrant and that his unfinished business includes an overhaul of his office after his officers were found by a federal judge to have racially profiled Latinos in traffic patrols that made him a national figure in the immigration debate. Arpaio was found in civil contempt for failing to stop the patrols after the judge ordered them halted in December 2011. Federal prosecutors are deciding whether to file a criminal contempt-of-court case against him punishable by up to six months of jail time if classified as a misdemeanor and an unspecified sentencing range if deemed a felony. The list of local law and order campaigns Soros has bankrolled have targeted other incumbents criticized for decisions involving race. They include a $408,000 donation to a first-time candidate for prosecutor in Chicago who won the Democratic primary in March against an incumbent criticized for charging a white police officer a full year after the officer shot a black teenager dead. In Florida, the incumbent prosecutor for the Orlando area known for prosecuting the Casey Anthony case attributed Soros' money to tipping voters against him during the last month of his campaign before the Aug. 30 primary. Jeff Ashton said opponent Aramis Alaya gained momentum after a Soros-funded group started running a TV spot on alleged legal system racial disparities. \"She was done,\" Ashton said. \"And then the huge amount of money started pouring in.\" Funding by the new anti-Arpaio group could also impact the presidential race because Arpaio is a strident Donald Trump supporter. Democrats hope to rally Arizona's Latinos \u2014 a voting bloc including many who have long reviled the sheriff \u2014 to show up to vote for Clinton in November. Chad Willems, the sheriff's campaign manager, said he suspected a well-funded anti-Arpaio group from outside Arizona would get involved in the campaign but doubted it would prevent Arpaio from winning. \"He is a known commodity here. The voters do still like him,\" Willems said. Penzone said in an interview that he has had no contact with Maricopa Strong or Soros and doubted money funneled into the race would level the playing field because Arpaio has so much. He has spent $8.9 million on his campaign so far. The development does show that some people outside Arizona want Arpaio out, Penzone said. \"With his name recognition and tenure in office and all that money, he is still falling short of expectations,\" Penzone said.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Bottom line: in the third and final presidential debate, Trump had his best outing yet. He was calm, informed and reasonable, and managed to again put Hillary on the defensive. He will have shored up support among conservatives by taking strong stances against abortion and in favor of gun rights. But by pressing those positions, and by not addressing family or education issues, he probably gained no ground with women, and that could cost him the election. The drama of the debate, though, was that Donald Trump refused to guarantee that he will accept the outcome of the election. Instead, he said he would \u201clook at it at the time,\u201d suggesting that he might challenge the result should he suspect significant interference in the vote. Hillary Clinton excitedly denounced Trump for \u201cdenigrating democracy\u201d and with breaking with our long-standing tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. Trump\u2019s position is in keeping with recent comments made to supporters that the election might be \u201crigged,\u201d a refrain that concerns some party officials and voters. His running mate Mike Pence and his daughter Ivanka have both agreed to accept the outcome of the vote; why not The Donald? Trump is a very fast learner. The difference between his performance in the first head-to-head encounter with Hillary Clinton and the last was vast. Not only did he stay on message, but he clearly has amassed a great deal of information in a very short time. Trump may be trying to gin up turn-out amongst his supporters. In the face of a barrage of negative publicity and weaker polling, Trump may fear that his backers will be discouraged, and fail to show up at the polls. The release of the new Project Veritas tape identifying actual voter fraud, and the firing of two Democratic operatives engaged in cheating, has given the issue of a rigged election actual substance. Trump has called for people to act as poll watchers, expressly to look out for signs of foul play. What could better whip up his followers than suspicions that the Clinton camp, and the DNC, is trying to fix the vote? It\u2019s not a crazy strategy. The entire country is alert to what has become the most aggressive media onslaught ever waged against a presidential candidate. The incessant reporting of unfavorable news about Trump, much-hyped revelations about his business dealings, the resolute reluctance to report WikiLeaks emails damaging to Hillary, the revelations about cozy relations between reporters and the Clinton camp \u2013 Trump can fairly claim that the media establishment is pitted against him. Add to that recent reports of Democratic operatives inciting violence at Trump rallies \u2013 violence which became central to Hillary\u2019s theme that Trump was \u201cdangerous\u201d and could not be trusted with the nuclear code \u2013 and there are reasons to be skeptical that the political playing field is level. Much of the recent assault on Trump, such as the great attention paid to the video of his lewd remarks about women or the days of coverage given to his contretemps with the former beauty queen, has appeared geared to depressing turnout by Trump voters. Hillary\u2019s operatives are extremely concerned that her voters won\u2019t show up because her unfavorables \u2013 like Trump\u2019s \u2013 are so high. They have sent one emissary after another \u2013 including President and Mrs. Obama \u2013 out to goad African-Americans, Hispanics and other members of the Obama coalition into going to the polls. What\u2019s even more effective? Making sure that Trump backers don\u2019t show up either. So perhaps Trump is engaging in tit for tat. Sadly, because of the media\u2019s very real bias, Trumps\u2019 comments will be portrayed as just more evidence of recklessness. Lost in the coverage will be mention of the Project Veritas recording or the firing of the Democrat apparatchiks. Pundits will be \u201cdismayed\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cwhining\u201d as President Obama described it. Lost will be the other real news of debate: Trump is a very fast learner. The difference between his performance in the first head-to-head encounter with Hillary Clinton and the last was vast. Not only did he stay on message, but he clearly has amassed a great deal of information in a very short time. \u00a0He spoke about Aleppo and ObamaCare, the economy and the Supreme Court with confidence. He will never match Hillary\u2019s mastery of policy detail; he doesn\u2019t need to. He just needs to sound competent, and he did. Moreover, Hillary was not in command.\u00a0 She failed to answer a question about apparent pay to play\u00a0 while she was Secretary of State, instead ranting on about the virtues of the Clinton Foundation that was finally interrupted by Chris Wallace. No one was fooled. Republicans cheered; finally, a moderator brought up the unholy history of the Clinton Foundation. Trump went after Hillary on the failures of policies towards Syria, Iraq and Libya. He again noted that she has been near the center of power for thirty years \u2013 time to have made some of the changes she has now promised to undertake. He again accused her and other Democrats of reaching out to blacks and Hispanics only every four years, when they need their votes. And, of course, he hit her over and over on trade, associating her with husband Bill\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d NAFTA deal. For her part, Hillary repeated worn lines denigrating Trump, accusing him of shipping jobs to Mexico and China by buying cheap imports for his projects (at least he created some jobs along the way), of belittling women, minorities and the disabled, of wanting to cut taxes for the wealthy, of suggesting we sunder our relations with staunch allies and of being in league with Putin. Trump was more successful in deflecting such charges than in the past, partly because he is better informed. When Hillary was confronted with WikiLeaked comments about her dream of \u201copen trade and open borders\u201d she immediately revisited her meme about Putin and Trump being in cahoots. Trump noted drily \u201cThat was quite a pivot\u201d, and indeed it was. Will Trump\u2019s better performance close Hillary\u2019s lead in the polls? It may help. Summing up, he said the country \u201ccannot afford four more years of Obama.\u201d That is the truth, and the most powerful message in Trump\u2019s arsenal.",

            "article_content": "FILE - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump points at Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as he speaks during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) Republicans have been divided as never before in this election. Some might have wished for a better candidate. Others, who liked the candidate better, might have wished for a better Party. But with only a few days left before the election it\u2019s time for all sides to unite to defeat the Democrats, at the top, middle and bottom of the ballot. It\u2019s time to put aside our differences, elect Trump, and defeat a candidate under an FBI investigation. In America\u2019s government of strong presidentialism, it\u2019s the candidate at the top who matters, and a vote for Trump is the only feasible method of defending the principles of freedom, justice and prosperity Republicans hold in common against the most serious threat we have ever faced, a threat that begins to look like the final defeat of republican government, and permanent decline for the country we love. That\u2019s why 130 respected Republicans thought-leaders have signed a second letter explaining why we support Donald Trump and urging Party unity, at scholarsandwritersforamerica.org. This is the most consequential electoral choice we\u2019ll have in our lifetime. Under Obama we have departed from the Founders\u2019 constitution of separation of powers towards one-man rule by the president. With Mrs. Clinton, we\u2019d see an even greater slide towards an all-powerful presidency, by an imperious person who holds subordinates in contempt and who labels Republicans as enemies and \u201cdeplorables.\u201d She doesn\u2019t have a legislative agenda. She has a regulatory and Supreme Court agenda, and the justices she would appoint could be expected to bless one-person rule by the president. That\u2019s why George Mason called this an \u201celective monarchy,\u201d which he said would be worse than George III. By contrast, Donald Trump has a legislative agenda. The person who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d can be expected to reach across to Congress to enact the sound legislation he proposed in his speech in Gettysburg. He has pledged to appoint judges in the mold of Justice Scalia, judges who would strike down the diktats of a president who ignores Congress as Obama did in his Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program. That program would have legalized 5 million undocumented aliens, and the Supreme Court split 4-4 on it. We know how a future Court would rule, with a new member appointed by Mrs. Clinton. And she\u2019s already told us of her plans to regularize millions of undocumented aliens by executive fiat. Absolute power corrupts, said Lord Acton. Were Mrs. Clinton elected, she\u2019d have the near absolute power of the American presidency. But she wouldn\u2019t need that to become corrupt. She\u2019s there already. Consider, then, what would happen were the \u201cClinton Cash\u201d machine to move into the White House. We\u2019d have a government with the morals of a banana republic; and crony capitalism, the silent killer of the American economy, would increasingly burden entrepreneurs. Wasteful regulations, drafted to benefit the clients of K Street lobbyists, would transfer wealth from dispersed lower and middle-class Americans to the rich and well-connected. The courtier class of Clinton donors would flourish, but woe to those who would fail to partner with the government. It might not be a kleptocracy, but it would be a huge move in that direction. Worse still, all the powers of the state would be unleashed against political enemies, with tax audits, EPA investigations, and charges brought under one of the numberless and technical federal public welfare offences. Montesquieu defined political liberty as the \u201ctranquility of spirit which comes from the opinion each one has of his security,\u201d and a Clinton administration would see to it that its political opponents would never know such tranquility. We saw a bit of this during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, and (whatever else might be said about him) he didn\u2019t have a mean bone in his body. With Mrs. Clinton it would be far worse. She is a very different sort of person from her spouse, and much more closely resembles a Richard Nixon, a Nixon without his accomplishments and with a fawning media that could be relied upon to defend her when it counted, as well as a corrupt administration that would back her to the hilt. And Donald Trump? He\u2019s an American archetype, a Sam Slick who seemingly has taken every legal advantage offered by the Tax and Bankruptcy Codes. And you expected something better from a New York City businessman? But having used all the advantages the law afforded him, he now proposes to curb them, with a Tax Code that would close off the loopholes and with important lobbying reforms that would end the corrupt revolving door between Congress and K Street. This is the most consequential electoral choice we\u2019ll have in our lifetime. Whatever differences might have had during the last twelve months, all Republicans must now unite behind the entire Republican ticket.",

            "article_content": "Harvard Law professor goes on 'The Kelly File' to react to the latest hearing on Hillary's server; discuss new book This is the strangest presidential election in my memory. Despite the polls, the outcome is utterly unpredictable. This was true even before Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent health issue. Just consider this: it was only a month ago that the Washington Post declared a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, \u201c[A] dispassionate examination of the data, combined with a coldblooded look at the candidates, the campaigns and presidential elections, produces only one possible conclusion: Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump in November\u2026 Three months from now, with the 2016 presidential election in the rearview mirror, we will look back and agree that the presidential election was over on Aug. 9th.\u201d On August 24, Slate \u2013 a liberal online magazine owned by the Washington Post similarly declared, \u201cThere is no horse race: it\u2019s Clinton by a mile, with Trump praying for black swans\u201d -- only to \u201cpredict\u201d one week later \u201cTrump-Clinton Probably Won\u2019t be A Landslide.\u201d A few days ago, in a desperate attempt to analyze the new polls showing Trump closing in on Clinton, Slate explained sheepishly \u201cThings realistically couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse for Trump than they were a few weeks ago, and so it\u2019s not a shock that they instead have gotten a little better of late.\u201d Some current polls even show Trump with a slight lead. The reality is that polling is incapable of accurately predicting the outcome of elections like this one, where so many voters are angry, resentful, emotional, negative, and frightened. In my new book, \u201cElectile Dysfunction: A Guide for the Unaroused Voter,\u201d I discuss in detail why so many voters now say they won\u2019t vote at all, or will vote for a third-party candidate. As the New York Times reported, \u201conly 9 percent of America chose Trump and Clinton as the Nominees.\u201d Or to put the voter\u2019s frustration with the candidates more starkly, \u201c81\u00a0percent of Americans say they would feel afraid following the election of one of the two politicians.\u201d Despite their perceived lack of agency, these voters may, of course, end up voting for one of the two major candidates when Election Day comes around. This may depend in part on whether the Johnson-Weld ticket does well enough in the polls to be included in the presidential and vice presidential debates. The rules require that a third-party candidate reach 15\u00a0percent in five national polls. This number is difficult to achieve because many of the polls do not include third-party candidates. But it is not impossible, and if it were to occur, and if the Johnson-Weld ticket outperformed or held its own against Clinton and Trump, then people who had decided not to vote or who couldn\u2019t make up their minds might cast ballots for the Libertarian candidates. It is unlikely that the Stein/Baraka ticket will be included in the debates or that it will garner any significant number of voters in key states because the candidates are so extreme in their views and so out of the mainstream of American political beliefs. However, if a significant number of voters do vote for a third or fourth party, this could impact the election, as the votes for Ralph Nader in 2000 may have determined the Florida outcome, which in turn determined the general election outcome. The bottom line is that in a bizarre election like this one\u2014with so many variables and so much emotion\u2014polls may well under -- or over -- predict votes for the two major candidates. Think about the vote on Brexit. Virtually all the polls\u2014including exit polls that asked voters whom they had voted for\u2014got it wrong. The financial markets got it wrong. The bookies got it wrong. The 2016 presidential election is more like the Brexit vote in many ways than it is like prior presidential elections. Both Brexit and this presidential election involve raw emotion, populism, anger, nationalism, class division, and other factors that distort accuracy in polling. Anyone who thinks they know who will be the next president of the United States is deceiving themselves! To be sure, the Electoral College vote is sometimes less difficult to predict than the popular vote, because it generally turns on a handful of closely contested critical states, such as Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. But in this election, there could be surprises in states that are usually secure for one party or the other. So even the electoral vote will be more difficult to predict than in previous elections. One reason for this unique unpredictability is the unique unpredictability of Donald Trump himself. No one really knows what he will say or do between now and the election. His position on important issues may change. Live televised debates will not allow him to rely on a TelePrompter, as he largely did in his acceptance speech or in his speech during his visit to Mexico City. He may once again become a loose cannon.\u00a0 No one can predict what he will say or do next. This may gain him votes, or it may lose him votes. Just remember: few, if any, pundits accurately predicted how far Trump would get when he first entered the race. When it comes to Donald Trump, the science of polling seems inadequate to the task. Hillary Clinton is more predictable, but her past actions may produce unpredictable results, as they did when FBI director Comey characterized her conduct with regard to her emails as \u201cextremely careless.\u201d It is also possible that more damaging information about her private email server or the Clinton Foundation may come from WikiLeaks or other such sources (whether these \u201crevelations\u201d are actually incriminating seems to be beside the point for those 54 percent of voters who, without first-hand knowledge of the investigation, suspect that the FBI engaged in a preferential treatment by not seeking criminal charges against Clinton.) Finally, it is difficult to assess what impact, if any, her recent health issues may have on voters. Another unpredictable factor that may impact the election is whether there are terrorist attacks in the lead-up to the voting. Islamic extremists would almost certainly like to see Trump beat Clinton, because they believe a Trump presidency would result in the kind of instability on which they thrive. If ISIS attacks American targets in late October, that could turn some undecided voters in favor of the candidate who says he will do anything to stop terrorism. If voters were to change their votes based on terrorist acts, that would only encourage more terrorism in the run-up to elections. A final reason why this election is so unpredictable is because the voter turnout is unpredictable. The \u201cBernie or bust\u201d crowd is threatening to stay home or vote for the Green Party. Young voters may do here what they did in Great Britain: many failed to vote in the Brexit referendum and then regretted their inaction when it became clear that if they had voted in the same proportion as older voters, Brexit would likely have been defeated. Some Clinton supporters worry that black voters who voted in large numbers for Barack Obama may cast fewer votes for Clinton in this election. Voters who usually vote Republican but can\u2019t bring themselves to pull the lever for Trump may decide to stay home. Turnout is unpredictable, and the effect of low voter turnout is also unpredictable. So, for all these reasons and others, no one can tell how this election will turn out. It would be a real tragedy and an insult to democracy if the election were to be decided by those who fail to vote, rather than by those who come out to vote for or against one of the two major candidates.",

            "article_content": "Republican vice-presidential nominee Gov. Mike Pence, right, and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine debate during the vice-presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016. (Andrew Gombert/Pool via AP) In the canine world, Mike Pence would be the Standard Poodle and Tim Kaine the yappy Chihuahua. Republican Vice Presidential candidate Pence was dignified, smart and likeable during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, while opponent Kaine was jumpy and annoying. But the differences went beyond style. Kaine presented a mini-me version of the Hillary Clinton campaign, focused on slamming and demeaning Donald Trump. Pressed to tell voters how his running mate would improve the lives of everyday Americans or rectify the mess she helped create in Syria, Kaine resorted to what Pence correctly described as the \u201cinsult-driven\u201d campaign. While Pence delivered concrete ideas and policies, Kaine fell back on well-practiced one-liners which, oft-repeated, began to sound silly; it turns out you can actually practice too much. But then there is not much substance to the Clinton campaign. When challenged on her lack of accomplishments as Secretary of State, Tim Kaine offered up the killing of Usama bin Laden. When asked how she might make the world safer, he offered up the killing of Usama bin Laden. When asked about temperament and credentials, Kaine volunteered the killing of Usama bin Laden. I could be wrong but I\u2019m pretty sure bin Laden only died once, and that Hillary had virtually nothing to do with it. True, she didn\u2019t throw herself in the way of the military personnel directing the mission and refuse to let them go forward. Instead, she was in the room consuming oxygen and converting it into CO2. Like a lot of other people. Kaine attempted throughout the evening to put Pence on the defensive over some of the more incendiary comments made over the past year by running mate Trump; Pence skillfully avoided being drawn into a pointless controversy. He also managed to avoid blaming the media for its unprecedented assault on a national candidate. That would have played well to Trump followers, but Pence did not need to go there. Instead, he went where few have dared to tread \u2013 into a heartfelt conversation about faith and abortion, without a doubt convincing anyone who was watching that he believed in the sanctity of life, and would try to persuade others to forego abortion in favor of adoption. He also criticized Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine for their support of partial-birth abortion, and good for him. Most of the country agrees the practice is heinous, but the pro-choice crowd goes along with it under cover of \u201cslippery slope\u201d concerns. No, it should be banned and Pence was totally credible on the topic. Pence also managed to do what Trump conspicuously failed to do in the first presidential debate \u2013 go after the numerous scandals that have destroyed the country\u2019s confidence in the credibility of Hillary Clinton. He reminded viewers of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s role as Bill and Hillary\u2019s political handmaiden\u00a0 and the apparent pay-to-play activities of Clinton while she served as Secretary of State. He also got in some zingers about the Clinton 30,000 emails that were destroyed. Asked how his ticket would get tough on Russia, Kaine trotted out (numerous times) the absurd charge that Trump is a fan of Vladimir Putin. (Yes, Trump has noted that Putin, head of a failing state, has enormously high approval ratings. He has also noted that by comparison President Obama looks and is toothless, as Russia elbows the U.S. out of Syria. ) Pence failed to note that Hillary Clinton enabled the Russians to take over half of America\u2019s uranium supplies, while accepting substantial donations from the purchaser into the Clinton Foundation. But he had plenty of material to charge Hillary as corrupt and, as Secretary of State, inconsequential. Pence made mincemeat out of the Iran deal; Kaine parried that one official in Israel thought it was helpful. Pence noted that Kaine had boycotted Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress; Kaine squirmed. Kaine said blocking refugees by country was unconstitutional; Pence rightly noted that was not true. Pence talked about the ground lost in Iraq under Obama and Clinton\u2019s failed policies \u2013 ground won through the sacrifice of American soldiers. Kaine parried by lauding the Iran deal. Oops; American fourth-graders know the nuke deal with Tehran is already falling apart and that a desperate President Obama was taken for a ride by the mullahs. And then he mentioned the killing of Usama bin Laden. And so it went, with Pence combing the fertile fields of Clintonian hypocrisy and scandal, and with Kaine trying to remember the best insults his team has launched against Trump. Perhaps the best line of the night was on the topic of Hillary\u2019s \u201ccareless\u201d handling of classified information. He said, as one father of a military man to another: \u201cIf your son or mine had done this, he would have been court martialed.\u201d Just so. The vice presidential candidates are more than nominally important in this election. Both candidates are long in the tooth, and Hillary Clinton, in particular, has suffered some health problems. It is not far-fetched to imagine that either Tim Kaine or Mike Pence could someday have to take over as president. Based on Tuesday night\u2019s performance, only Mike Pence is up to the task.",

            "article_content": "FILE - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in New York, Tuesday, May 31, 2016. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) For nearly seventeen months now, I presumed that Donald Trump was playing an elaborate game of chicken with the American people. Sure, Trump was running for president. But there\u2019s no way it would last until Election Day. The moment another Republican embraced the border wall, or Trump tired of the candidates\u2019 debates, or voters tired of Trump, he\u2019d quit the race and return to business as usual: developing real estate and fostering his cult of personality. But Trump kept going \u2013 through the primaries, then the general election, to a stunning Election Night upset that earns him a four-year stay in a white, albeit less ornate mansion that\u2019s a short stroll from the fancier hotel he recently opened in the nation\u2019s capital. Now Donald Trump will be the nation\u2019s 45th President. Repeat, exhale . . . then say it again. Donald Trump will be the nation\u2019s 45th President. The trick now: solving the Bill McKay question. That\u2019s the fictional politician Robert Redford played in the 1972 movie \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d which ends with the senator-elect asking: \u201cWhat do we now?\u201d. Here are 10 suggestions for President-Elect Trump. 1. Seize the Moment. I was going to start this by suggesting Trump spend a week in Palm Beach seclusion for some much-needed R&R. That can wait until Thanksgiving and beyond, when it\u2019s time for the big transition decisions that can be done behind the scenes. If I were Trump, I\u2019d travel back to the unlikeliest states that delivered for him on Election Day and hold large rallies \u2013 both to thank the voters and explain the greater mission ahead to change Washington\u2019s culture. I\u2019d add in a couple of rallies in states that didn\u2019t vote for him, just to underscore that he wants to be a president for the entire people. Trump should invite Hillary Clinton for a private lunch. He should also let it be known that he wants to sit down with President Obama and discuss an amicable transition. 2. Read Up on Andrew Jackson. This was only the second time in the history of the nation that an election was held at the end of three consecutive two-term presidencies. In 1824, it was John Quincy Adams staving off a populist challenge from Andrew Jackson, the man who statue sits in Lafayette Park, across the street from the North Portico of the White House. That race was bitter and ended with talk of a rigged system (a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d between Adams and House Speaker Henry Clay). Four years later, Jackson rode the revolution into Washington, the tip of the spear of voter resentment against a political class that had dominated the first 50 years of the republic. This could have been the scenario in 2020. Much to everyone\u2019s surprise, the revolution came four years ahead of schedule, with the unlikeliest of generals leading the charge. I don\u2019t know if Trump is one for history, but someone in his world should introduce the man to Jackson and the roots of American populism. After all, it\u2019s now Trump who gets to write the next chapter. 3. Time to Let Go. Assuming Trump is able to be a gracious winner (and his speech Wednesday night was a good start), it\u2019s time to pivot out of campaign mode. He\u2019s now tasked with acting as a statesman, not a showman treating presidential political like a reality TV show. It\u2019s time to bid adieu to \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and \u201cLying Ted\u201d and the \u201ccorrupt media\u201d. For Trump to have any semblance of dignified leadership, he has to let go of the petty insults and juvenile denigrations that are simply unbecoming of a president. That includes the dead-of-the-night tweeting. \u00a0Yes, I\u2019d let the incoming president hold on his Smartphone \u2013 so long as he limits it to crowd selfies. 4. Meet With GOP Thought Leaders. Can Trump work with a Republican Congress? Some members will be on board right away; for others, it will take time (hint: handing out presidential goodies has a way of healing wounds). The more immediate concern for Trump would be getting Republican thought leaders on board \u2013 the commentary class whose support will come in handy when it\u2019s time to rally the party behind a first-term agenda. There\u2019s nothing stopping Trump from holding a series of dinner salons with influential conservatives in New York (The Wall Street Journal editorial board, for example) and in the District of Columbia (Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, to name just a few). Presidents tend to do this at the end of their presidency \u2013 courting historians in an attempt to spin their first draft of history. Trump needs the ideas merchants sooner than he may realize. 5. Put Someone in The West Wing Who\u2019ll Challenge You. Throughout the saga that was the Trump campaign, there was always the question of adult supervision: an aide, a confidante who could tell Trump things he didn\u2019t want to hear and convince him to moderate bad habits. Kellyanne Conway came closest to achieving disciplinary influence over Trump. At best, she\u2019ll divide her time between Washington and her home in northern New Jersey. This is a job for the new chief of staff. Who has the stature to pull this off? New Gingrich? Rudy Giuliani? Would either be willing to be the West Wing\u2019s bad cop, confronting Trump when they think he\u2019s wrong on policy, strategy or execution? This is a time when it pays to have wise counsel from a long-time Washington insider. We\u2019ll see if Trump lets anyone of that ilk inside the tent. 6. Build a Cabinet of Insiders and Outsiders. Are we in store for talk of another \u201cTeam Of Rivals\u201d approach to building a presidential cabinet (in reality, the gang Barack Obama assembled wasn\u2019t all that Lincoln-esque). Trump could import some rivals from the GOP primaries \u2013 Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee tuned out to be loyal surrogates. And there\u2019s the deep bench on Republicans in Congress and in running states nationwide. What Trump does about Chris Christie \u2013 leading the transition effort, perhaps coveting the Attorney General slot, but tainted by last week\u2019s \u201cBridgegate\u201d convictions \u2013 will be interesting to watch. A reminder for Trump: in addition to promising to drain the Washington, D.C. swamp, he began the campaign vowing to bring a business sensibility to the federal government. If he doesn\u2019t sprinkle his cabinet with secretaries possessing a private sector, outsiders\u2019 perspective, then the president-elect has broken his first pledge. 7. Reboot Press Relations. If you think the Chief of Staff will have it tough, try being the new White House Secretary. Most new administrations get a period of grace before the press starts turning the screws. Not Trump \u2013 certainly not after months of demonizing his press entourage. Trump won\u2019t receive the same fan-boy coverage that characterized Obama\u2019s first year on the job. At best, he plays for a draw by being more transparent than his predecessor (not a high bar to clear). Just as stressful for the press secretary will be dealing with the new president when there\u2019s bad press \u2013 that\u2019s not an if, but a when. We know Trump can be overly sensitive to negative coverage. If he\u2019s smart, he resists the urge to storm into the Briefing Room and tell the press corps what\u2019s on his mind. 8. Deliver a Humble Inaugural. It took Ronald Reagan 2,427 words to deliver a moving inaugural in 1981. JFK did his in 1,366 words. Abraham Lincoln, in 1865, was even terser: a mere 700 words. For Trump, this first big speech is more than the opening act of his presidency. It\u2019s about making a good first impression with a skeptical public. He foes that by demonstrating the enormity of the vow he will have just taken. Trump has an advantage here: a bench of talented speechwriters from the past three Republican presidencies who may be willing to help with the historical (my Hoover Institution colleague Peter Robinson, author of Reagan\u2019s \u201cTear Down This Wall\u201d speech, would be a good place to start). Trump should task a team to study how past presidents approached their first address, pair it with some solid polling and focus groups, and keep the rhetoric to a minimum and the style muted. If so, Trump just might get off to a good start. 9. Strike Fast with the Stroke of a Pen. For all the talk of what he can pull off with a Republican Congress, consider what Trump can do on his own, thanks to the use of executive orders. Here is a list of 13 things Trump could do in his first day on the job: Cancelling the Paris climate accord, scrapping energy regulations, approving the Keystone pipeline, reversing coal leasing moratoriums on federal lands. And maybe the biggest blow of all: he could kill the Iran nuclear deal. 10. Offer a Pragmatic Agenda. Those three consecutive two-term presidencies were marked by consistency and comity, the final stretch of the run dubbed the \u201cEra of Good Feelings\u201d. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama almost didn\u2019t get that second term because they bit off more than they could chew once they took office. For each, a big reach on health care reform would have devastating consequences I midterm elections. Trump doesn\u2019t lack for bold, provocative ideas \u2013 most notably, building that wall along the southern border. But can he do that, tax reform, and set a new course on defense spending and national security, not to mention repealing and replacing ObamaCare? Of course not. So where should Trump start? I\u2019d choose tax reform. There\u2019s arguably more bipartisan consensus on that than anything else he\u2019s proposed. And the promise of new revenue will help justify any extra dough Trump wants to spend on a Pentagon buildup or an infrastructure blueprint. Can Trump succeed at all of the above? It helps that the media will usher him into office with brutally low expectations. If he gets to work, takes the job seriously and begins to make headway in a horribly divided town, that bar has nowhere to go but up.",

When history records the story of the 2016 election there will be a particular place of opprobrium for James Comey and Federal Bureau of Investigation. It\u2019s usually a good sign when criminal justice officials manage to make both political parties upset. It\u2019s often a hallmark of justice well served. But not, apparently, when it happens in a round-robin fashion. Comey finishes the election cycle with a letter to congress about the reinvigorated investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, which essentially says: never mind! We have talked before about what we will leave behind after the 2016 election. Lamentably, one of those things is the esteem with which Americans viewed their federal police force. But we will leave that for another time. Right now, what matters is the impact on the election. Is it too close to the end of voting to make a difference? Will anyone really care? To figure that out, the first thing to examine is the effect of Comey\u2019s first letter refreshing the investigation. Some of the perceived consequence wasn\u2019t really from Comey at all, but rather an increase in Republican support for Donald Trump in the closing weeks of the election. As the GOP came home, by and large, the race tightened. Comey\u2019s letter did have some effect though. As we look at the WaPo/ABC News tracking poll, we can see how the buffeting winds of Comeygate blew. Democrats became despondent while Republicans cheered up. When a race is as close as this one, especially in key states, voter intensity means a great deal. It\u2019s one thing to be a likely voter. It\u2019s another thing to be fired up about it and telling your friends, neighbors and relatives to get out and vote. Faced with a possibility of what seemed like criminal charges, Democrats got droopy and Republicans got fired up. We saw that with voters\u2019 favorable views of Clinton taking a hit. But, by the end of last week, even those trends had either stopped or reversed. So does Comey\u2019s fourth-quarter bobble make any difference? Probably so. Look for Democratic voter intensity to jump up as the Clinton campaign touts its vindication of what the Clinton campaign will characterize as an updated version of the candidate\u2019s famous quote: \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d If you thought Team Clinton took victory laps this summer when Comey first dropped the case, you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet. Before today\u2019s announcement, Republicans believed that Comey had delivered Trump\u2019s closing argument: corruption and a call to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Instead, Comey has given Clinton her talking points for the last 50 hours of the race: these Republican guys won\u2019t stop America\u2019s first female president. THE RULEBOOK: TEAM OF RIVALS\u201cThe idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally obtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man.\u201d\u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 70 TIME OUT: PULLING FROM BEHINDIn honor of Saturday\u2019s New York City Marathon, we look back forty years ago, in America\u2019s bicentennial year, when event was first hosted outside Central Park to include the city\u2019s five boroughs.

An 11-mile\u2026stretch of coast was covered in the icy spheres. The sculptural shapes range from the size of a tennis ball to almost [3 feet] across. They result from a rare environmental process where small pieces of ice form, are rolled by wind and water, and end up as giant snowballs. Locals in the village of Nyda, which lies on the Yamal Peninsula just above the Arctic Circle, say they have never seen anything to compare to them. Russian TV quoted an explanation from Sergei Lisenkov, press secretary of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute: \u2018As a rule, first there is a primary natural phenomenon - sludge ice, slob ice. Then comes a combination of the effects of the wind, the lay of the coastline, and the temperature and wind conditions.

            "article_content": "GOP nominee discusses his 'tough standards'; Carl Cameron with the Republican roundup for 'Special Report' Donald Trump said Sunday he would subject people from France, among other countries, to \"extreme vetting\" as they seek to enter the United States, a move he says is necessary to deter terror attacks. The GOP presidential nominee, in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" was asked if his proposal might mean that ultimately far fewer people from overseas would be allowed into the U.S. \"Maybe we get to that point,\" Trump replied, adding: \"We have to be smart and we have to be vigilant and we have to be strong.\" In the interview, Trump also rejected suggestions that his stance on requiring NATO members to pay their share was a mistake; dismissed descriptions of his nomination acceptance speech as \"dark,\" instead calling it \"optimistic\"; and expressed disapproval of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who is seeking a Senate seat from Louisiana. Trump reiterated that he wouldn't release his tax returns until an IRS audit is complete, although such an inquiry doesn't bar him from making the documents public. Trump also said he believes 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost the election because of a public scrutiny of his taxes. For months Trump has called for a temporary ban on foreign Muslims seeking to enter the United States and criticized the Obama administration for continuing to admit refugees from Syria. In his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, he said the U.S. \"must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place\" -- notably leaving out any reference to Muslims or to Syria, Iraq and other Mideast nations. In the NBC interview, Trump noted \"specific problems\" in Germany and France and \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd asked if his proposal would limit immigration from France. \"They've been compromised by terrorism,\" Todd said. Trump replied: \"They have totally been. And you know why? It's their own fault. Because they allowed people to come into their territory.\" He then called for \"extreme vetting\" and said: \"We have to have tough, we're going to have tough standards. ... If a person can't prove what they have to be able to prove, they're not coming into this country.\" He also took issue with descriptions of his convention speech earlier in the week as \"dark.\" `'It was an optimistic speech,\" Trump said. Referring to his mention of crime as well as shootings and terrorist attacks both here and overseas, he said, \"Sure, I talk about the problems, but we're going to solve the problems.\" And he criticized Duke, who cited Trump's campaign as an inspiration for his Senate bid. Trump was quick to say he rejected efforts by Duke to run for the Senate. In an interview several months ago, Trump was asked about Duke offering his support and Trump responded: \"I don't know anything about David Duke.\" His initial response drew harsh criticism from Democrats, Republicans and civil rights groups,\" and he later said \"I disavow\" Duke's support.

They carried stethoscopes. They dressed head-to-toe in stage black and donned domino masks that looked like something borrowed from the Riddler. Lawmakers had a congressional safe to crack. They had to figure out how to fund the government by Friday night to avoid a government shutdown, approve money for the Zika crisis, address the toxic-water catastrophe in Flint, Mich., and simultaneously help flood victims in Louisiana. It\u2019s not clear if the safe in question read Hamilton, SentrySafe or Honeywell. But the vault was fortified with diamond hardplate locks, devices to relock the bolts and anti-pry doors. This wouldn\u2019t be easy. Safecrackers sometimes use a stethoscope or other audio amplification devices to listen for the click of tumblers falling into place as they determine the combination to open a safe. It was all a matter of just figuring out which digit fell where before lawmakers could solve their parliamentary puzzle. As it turns out, aid to Flint was the crucial part to cracking this safe. Once lawmakers unlocked that issue, the tumblers aligned and they settled the host of issues. Late Tuesday night, House Republican and Democratic leaders forged a deal to allow debate on an amendment crafted by Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., to provide $170 million in emergency relief for Flint. Democrats threatened to withhold support for a stopgap spending bill to fund the government unless Republicans addressed Flint. That put House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in a pickle. The speaker risked a government shutdown unless he could engineer enough votes to pass an interim bill to keep the lights burning through mid-December. A chunk of House Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote yea simply because they failed to secure any of the items in the bill important to conservatives. The other option for Ryan was to latch Flint aid to the spending bill. That would court Democrats and avert the shutdown. But Ryan knew he couldn\u2019t go there. Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, deployed that strategy on various occasions. Even conservatives chastised Boehner for bills that garnered a healthy mix of Democrats and Republicans -- but failed to address conservative priorities trumpeted by influential outside groups such as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth. In some respects, cracking a safe and finding a political solution to a legislative problem is a lot like Goldilocks principle. None of the tumblers can be out of alignment at all. The lock won\u2019t open. It\u2019s not too hot. Not too cold. But just right. Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., finally hit their mark. The duo carved an agreement moving the Flint money to a water policy bill, and Democrats would help support the interim spending bill. Congress would fund the government, and Ryan wouldn\u2019t have to face onerous, internal political consequences. \u201cWhat happened is what I was hoping and planning on happening all along,\u201d said Ryan about the resolution. \u201cI thought it was important to get Flint out of the continuing resolution debate and where it belongs in the water resources bill. Flint is a water resources problem that therefore should be addressed in water resources legislation.\u201d Pelosi knew she held the combination to the safe. \u201cThere's no question the fact that they did not have the votes gave us leverage. But we were prepared,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe children of Flint could not be neglected any longer by this Congress.\u201d Contrast this to what Pelosi said the day before when asked about Flint and the stopgap bill. \u201cThey could help themselves a lot by putting Flint in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have problems on this bill unless they have the votes on their side.\u201d Perhaps, this was the only plausible outcome available. Late Wednesday afternoon, the House OK\u2019d the Flint amendment 284-141. On its face, that looks like a big bipartisan vote. It was. 101 Republicans and 183 Democrats voted \u201caye\u201d to attach Kildee\u2019s amendment to the water policy bill. All \u201cnoes\u201d came from Republicans. The GOP often mentions that it likes to secure a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d on issues. With 247 Republican House members, 101 yeas is a far cry from 50.1 percent of that majority. But no matter. Pelosi and Democrats got what they wanted. Speaking generally, conservatives did not. Late Wednesday night, the House approved the interim spending bill funding the government through December 9 and avoiding a shutdown. The vote: 342-85. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for the package from Democrats and Republicans. Republicans supplied 170 yeas. Democrats slightly outpaced their colleagues with 172 ayes. And, the GOP secured a \u201cmajority of the majority.\u201d But Republicans couldn\u2019t have advanced the plan without Democrats -- to say nothing of solving the Flint puzzle. So, some may ask why 11 months into his speakership does Ryan still need assistance from Democrats to approve spending bills? And how is this not different from the conundrum which weighted down his predecessor, John Boehner? Well, the speaker may have changed, but not the membership. \u201cI think people in our caucus understand the reality of the moment that this divided government presents us with,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan also took a swipe at retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Senate Democrats whom the speaker accused of slowing down annual spending bills. \u201cMy hope is that after the election, they'll drop their political shenanigans and we'll get on at doing the serious business of actually appropriating. If we don't, we'll do another\u201d continuing resolution, Ryan said. By their nature, continuing resolutions, or CR\u2019s, fund the government at existing levels if lawmakers fail to craft a broader agreement. This is what drives some Congressional conservatives up a wall. First, they hoped the House would advance individual spending bills this year under Ryan\u2019s stewardship. The House adopted several. But that\u2019s why they relied on a CR now, glomming everything together. Secondly, the House didn\u2019t even manage to approve a budget, the first step in the annual spending process. Conservatives hoped for a lower spending level for the bill. The total spending figure for this bill is $1.067 trillion. Conservatives advocated $1.040 trillion. Many members of the House Freedom Caucus aimed to tuck policy provisions into the legislation. Those \u201criders\u201d included a prohibition for Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics to receive Zika aid. They also wanted to super-vet Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. None of those elements made it into the final package. \u201cEstablishment Republicans have once again partnered with Democrats to ignore our fiscal crisis, rather than join conservatives determined to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d complained Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho. \u201cOur new Republican leadership vowed to complete the regular appropriations process, passing the 12 bills that fulfill the duty of Congress to take good care in spending taxpayer dollars. Today, they punted.\u201d This is why some members of the Freedom Caucus wonder if things are really that different under the Ryan regime versus Boehner\u2019s. Moreover, one House conservative told Fox they should have just let the government shut down last night. \u201cWe won seats in 2014, didn\u2019t we?\u201d asked the Republican who asked to remain anonymous. After the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, Republicans padded their House majority by winning 13 seats in the 2014 midterm elections. That propelled the GOP to its biggest House majority since the late 1920s. Some conservatives simply don\u2019t think going to the mat over a government shutdown is that bad a strategy. After some haggling, Democrats and Republicans managed to pick the combination lock and avoid a shutdown this fall. It\u2019s likely there could be another safe that needs cracking just before Christmas. Perhaps the most-robust safe could arrive at the capitol next March as lawmakers wrestle with raising the debt ceiling. The debt limit battle is always an ambitious enterprise. One wonders how skilled the safecrackers will have to be to crack the code on that challenge next year.",

            "article_content": "Contractors break their silence to Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0Two State Department contractors, with decades of experience protecting the United States' most sensitive secrets, are speaking out for the first time about Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state and how the rules for government security clearance holders did not seem to apply to Clinton and her team. \u201cThe State Department was her oyster and it was great for the [Clinton] foundation and great for the Clintons to be able to have such a great position,\"\u00a0Dave Whitnah told Fox News. Whitnah said he worked within the State Department's Office of Security Technology which is responsible for cameras and alarms and sweeping for bugs.\u00a0Whitnah said everyone understood the secretary of state is the primary target of foreign intelligence services. \u201cThe number one person would be the secretary of state and their communications,\"\u00a0Whitnah explained. \"You can think of the Iran negotiations, nuclear negotiation, negotiations with Russia, talks with Russia.\u00a0You know, anything to do with foreign policy.\" Whitnah emphasized that tens of millions of dollars were spent on technical security for Clinton that apparently was disregarded as her team traveled around the world on official U.S. government business. \"It was unfathomable that [her BlackBerry] would be used for anything other than just unclassified communication,\"\u00a0Whitnah said. Clinton\u2019s devices were not certified as secure by the State Department.\u00a0As for her use of a non-secure BlackBerry, Whitnah stressed that email can be intercepted and, \u201cEven if turned off, it\u2019s still a listening device so that\u2019s why you take out the batteries.\u201d As Clinton was sworn in as secretary in January 2009, government contractor Amel Smith said he was also working at the department and: \"State Department rules are clear. I helped write those rules.\" Smith says his 30 years of experience includes serving in the U.S. Army's 82nd\u00a0Airborne, before becoming a counter-intelligence and counter-espionage investigator at State tracking down breaches of classified materials. He reviewed some of the FBI witness interviews from the Clinton email investigation with Fox News, and questioned those who claimed not to have the proper training in handling sensitive information. \"I hear things like, well, I forgot, um, I don't know that I was trained, I don't know this. You know -- every single person that had access to that information when it was sent is in violation,\" Smith emphasized. The FBI witness interviews also show secure facilities for classified information -- known as SCIFs -- were specially built for Clinton in her in Washington, D.C., and Chappaqua, N.Y., homes.\u00a0Doors that were supposed to be locked were left open. \"If you've got an uncleared person in there, it's automatically a compromise,\"\u00a0Smith said. Another FBI interview summary said there were personally owned desktop computers in the secure facilities at Clinton's homes, yet she told the FBI that she did not have a computer of any kind in these facilities. \"If somebody said they're there, then they probably were there, and you know, the reason you would deny it was because you probably didn't have approval,\"\u00a0Smith said. Having unapproved computers in a SCIF would automatically call for a security investigation. Asked for his reaction to Clinton's claim that nothing she sent or received was marked classified, Whitnah called that assertion a \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d\u00a0Fox News was first to report in June that at least one of the emails contained a classified information portion marking for \"c\" which is confidential. FBI Director James Comey later said in July when he recommended against criminal charges that a handful of Clinton emails contained classified markings. But more than 2,100 emails with classified information,\u00a0and at least 22 at the \u201ctop secret\u201d level, passed through Clinton's unsecured private server.\u00a0Asked how it happened, Smith said, \"Personally, there had to have been somebody moving classified information from C-LAN, C-LAN again is Secret, Confidential only, and JWICS. JWICS is where all top secret information is.\" After new emails were found in the Anthony Weiner sexting case belonging to his estranged wife Clinton aide Huma Abedin, the FBI reopened the Clinton email investigation.\u00a0On Sunday, Comey said the emails did not change his recommendation against criminal charges because his investigators did not find intent to move classified materials outside secure government channels \"Whether it's the private email server, whether it's this private laptop. If there's classified -- one document on there -- that's classified, it's a violation. Somebody violated [the] law,\"\u00a0Smith said. \"Throw all the politics out the window, what we're talking about is the defense of this nation.\" Asked about Smith and Whitnah, who filed a complaint against the State Department, a department spokesman said they were not direct hires -- adding that the head of diplomatic security told the FBI that Clinton was \"very responsive to security issues.\"",

            "article_content": "President-elect speaks to the nation from New York City Donald Trump, defying the pundits and polls to the end, defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election and claimed an establishment-stunning victory that exposes the depth of voter dissatisfaction \u2013 and signals immense changes ahead for American policy at home and abroad. Seventeen months after the billionaire tycoon\u2019s Trump Tower entrance into the race, the first-time candidate once dismissed by the political elite will become the 45th\u00a0president, Fox News projects. Speaking to cheering supporters early Wednesday morning at his victory party in New York City, the Republican candidate and now president-elect said Clinton called to congratulate him, and Fox News confirms she has conceded. Despite their hard-fought campaign, Trump praised Clinton for her service and said \u201cit is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d \u201cI will be president for all Americans,\u201d Trump vowed, after a brief introduction by running mate Mike Pence. TRUMP'S AGENDA: WHAT HIS ELECTION MEANS FOR AMERICA Sounding a call to \u201creclaim our country\u2019s destiny,\u201d Trump declared: \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \u2026 America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.\u201d Trump will be the oldest president in U.S. history, entering the Oval Office at age 70. With her defeat, Clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the United States. Though Clinton called Trump, her campaign initially did not concede defeat. Earlier, her campaign chairman John Podesta addressed supporters nearby in New York and said several states were \u201ctoo close to call.\u201d Clinton herself did not appear at the rally. Podesta had urged supporters to \u201chead home\u201d and said they would not have \u201canything more to say tonight.\u201d Amid Trump\u2019s victory, Republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the House and Senate, improving Trump\u2019s chances of advancing his agenda in office. A surge of support in key battlegrounds \u2013 and especially surprise victories in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 helped propel Trump to victory. The GOP nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Iowa. Clinton won her share of battlegrounds, including Virginia and Nevada and Colorado, but could not make up for Trump\u2019s strong performance in other states thought to favor the Democrat. The billionaire businessman\u2019s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround, after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be \u201crigged\u201d against him. Clinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into Tuesday\u2019s vote, yet the polls had been tightening in the race\u2019s closing days. His victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor \u2013 and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race. Without question, his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent. Eleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton\u2019s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but the political damage may have been done. And the WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Podesta\u2019s account became a constant distraction for the campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal concerns about the Clinton family\u2019s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries. This at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump that came out in October (which he denies), following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women. Trump\u2019s victory marks the second time Clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female U.S. president, having been defeated by President Obama in their 2008 primary race. But Trump has been able to defy expectations from the start. He defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the Republican primaries \u2013 stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider, populist message; throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates; and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable, learn-as-he-goes campaign style. He also defied party orthodoxy, railing against free-trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership and staking out a sometimes-confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve. Democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow. Trump was aided by the infrastructure of the GOP, but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by Clinton. While she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high-powered surrogates, Trump\u2019s campaign was driven mainly by him, an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers. Surrogates like retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani advocated aggressively for the Republican nominee, but he remained at odds with many influential elected Republicans who in some cases \u2013 as with House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 endorsed him, but only reluctantly. His stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals \u2013 including variations on a plan to suspend Muslim immigration from certain countries \u2013 also made party brass uncomfortable. The late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional Republicans to abandon him entirely. But even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding Trump, whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee\u2019s tensions with the GOP establishment and saw him as the true change-maker in the election.",

How ironic, given the recent exposure of just how opaque the curtain of deception behind which the president\u2019s unpopular health law was sold has been. As more damaging video of ObamaCare architect Johnathan Gruber continues to hit the internet, Democrats are doing their best to dance away from his disparaging comments about American voters. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi went as far as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. He didn\u2019t help write our bill,\u201d during a press conference Thursday. But that wasn\u2019t Pelosi\u2019s tune leading up to the health law\u2019s passage. Fox News: \u201cAt the time, her office put out a \u2018health insurance reform mythbuster\u2019 press release pointing to the work of \u2018noted MIT health care economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019 in examining the House bill\u2019s impact on premiums. They noted that Gruber found it \u2018would result in lower premiums than under current law for the millions of Americans using the newly-established Health Insurance Exchange.\u2019\u201d Of course the clouds covering an administration\u2019s touted transparency shouldn\u2019t be surprising given sunny forecasts Americans were sold like \u201cyou can keep it\u201d that ultimately fell flat for all to see. [\u201cWe were subjected during the Obamacare debate to a whole lot of stuff that we all knew was not true, not even close to true.

Obama told reporters he would not \u201cstand by\u201d and that his proposed fixes to the nation\u2019s immigration system were \u201cway overdue.\u201d\u00a0The president continued to blame Republican inaction to justify his go-it-alone plans, \u201cI indicated to Speaker [John Boehner] several months ago that if in fact Congress failed to act I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better.\u201d The president was emphatic about his intention to pursue executive action saying, \u201cThat\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s going to happen before the end of the year.\u201dConservatives push funding fight - Washington Examiner: \u201cConservative lawmakers and groups are pushing Republican leaders to pass a short-term government spending bill so that they will have more power to defund any executive action from President Obama on immigration as well as other measures. Government funding runs out Dec. 12, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are leaning toward passing an omnibus appropriations bill funding the government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Doing so, advocates of that strategy say, would avoid a messy and contentious government shutdown or more brinksmanship early in the new year after a wave GOP election in which voters expressed a desire for bipartisan cooperation. But conservative members of the GOP conference argue that passing an omnibus spending bill would give away most, if not all, of the leverage they can exert in the next year against Obama and Democrats.\u201dGOP considers legal action on Obama immigration move - WaPo: \u201cHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) is considering expanding a proposed federal lawsuit over President Obama\u2019s executive orders to include action on immigration. Filing a separate lawsuit over the president\u2019s authority to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation is another option that gained traction Thursday during talks among party leaders.\u201dOBAMA NOT BUDGING ON PIPELINE President Obama would not budge from the \u201cdim\u201d view his administration has of a legislative push on the Keystone pipeline ahead of a key House vote on the project slated for today. At a press conference in Burma, the president said he wants to let a review process \u2013 now in its sixth year - run its course. Pressed by Republican leadership to state where he stands, Obama said his administration believes the project should be judged on the basis of whether it accelerates climate change. Obama also insisted the pipeline would not be a \u201cmassive jobs bill\u201d and would have no effect on U.S. gas prices. Senate Republicans and several moderate Democrats have pushed for the project to be approved for years. Supporters say the construction of the pipeline would create tens of thousands of jobs. But the project divides Democrats, with environmentalists in opposition while some unions as well as energy-state and business-minded lawmakers support it. The Senate is expected to hold a vote on the pipeline Tuesday. Fox News has more. Fox News Sunday: Changing climate - Host Chris Wallace welcomes Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen.

The second manned mission to the lunar surface, carrying astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard Gordon and Alan Bean, started off with harrowing moments of its own. With Richard Nixon, the first president to view the liftoff of a manned mission looking on, lightning struck the ascending Saturn 5 rocket just 36 seconds after launch and again at 16 seconds later. The strikes tripped circuit breakers, cutting off power to the Apollo command module.\u00a0 Fortunately, the rocket continued its ascent normally, power was restored and 5 days later the lunar module Intrepid made a precision landing on the Ocean of Storms.

            "article_content": "FILE - In this June 3, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures to a his camouflaged \"Make America Great\" hat at a campaign rally at the Redding Municipal Airport in Redding, Calif.  Trump's prediction that he can win California in the November presidential election challenges the dismal history for Republican nominees in one of the nation's Democratic strongholds. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 Donald Trump says the United States admits Syrian refugees without checking their backgrounds and that Hillary Clinton wants to allow \"radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country.\" Neither is so, part of a pattern of exaggeration that strains the credibility of his argument since the Orlando nightclub shooting that the U.S. faces apocalyptic danger from Muslim immigrants. Trump's rhetoric has been slashing, polarizing, passionate and at times illogical. He confuses immigrants with refugees and overlooks the fact some extremists are U.S. citizens. He speaks as if the U.S. border is a gate wide open. And his numbers are off. It's a given that hyperbole comes with Trump territory. He's acknowledged that exaggeration for dramatic effect is part of how he rolls. It's how he connects at a gut level with supporters who look past mangled facts to what they see as a larger truth, while opponents stand back aghast. Altogether, the Orlando massacre by a U.S. citizen with Islamist beliefs, radical sympathies and an apparently tortured psyche has reignited a tangle of debates on domestic terrorism, threats from abroad, the nation's refugee traditions, hate crimes and guns in the early days of the Trump-Clinton general election campaign. A look at some of Trump's recent statements on those issues and how they compare with the facts: ___ TRUMP: \"We are taking in thousands of people into our country. We have no idea where they come from, we have no idea who the hell they are. We know they believe in certain things that we don't want to believe in.\" THE FACTS: It's not true that the government knows nothing about refugees who come to the United States. The State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration keeps detailed records about how many refugees arrive monthly, and from where. The information is available to the public online through the agency's Refugee Processing Center (www.wrapsnet.org). The arrival information is broken down by country and region. In May, for example, 6,511 refugees were resettled in the United States. The Democratic Republic of the Congo had the largest number of refugees who arrived last month, 1,274. Annual data about immigrants is also available from the government through the Homeland Security Department's Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. Would-be immigrants and refugees are screened to ensure they haven't been identified by intelligence agencies or law enforcement as having ties to terrorist organizations or criminal records. But people's belief systems are not generally considered as part of their applications to move to the United States. ___ TRUMP: \"And yet you see this great migration, which is a horrible thing to watch.\" THE FACTS: Trump is right that there is a mass migration taking place from Syria and other countries in the Middle East. Millions of people are thought to have fled. But he's wrong to imply that the huge influx has come into the United States. Since 2011, about 5,760 Syrian refugees have been brought to the U.S. As of the end of May, 41,424 refugees from around the world have come to the United States since the start of the budget year in October. According to the State Department, 14,898 of those people are from the \"Near East/South Asia\" region, which includes Syria. But only 2,805 Syrians were among them. As a whole, African nations have accounted for more refugees and Myanmar (also known as Burma) leads all countries, with 8,112 refugees, in the first eight months of the current budget year. According to the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, more than 1 million Syrians have sought refuge in Europe since 2011. That's the \"great migration.\" ___ TRUMP: \"Now she (Clinton) wants to allow them to come into our country pretty much unvetted because every law enforcement person that I've spoken to and that you watched and that you read is saying it's very hard, if not impossible, to check out people. There are just no papers. There are no papers. And yet you see this great migration.\" \"Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them or to prevent the radicalization of their children. \"Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country \u2014 they enslave women and murder gays.\" THE FACTS: That's not what Clinton has said. The presumptive Democratic nominee says she wants to \"begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.\" Clinton proposes that the United States accept as many as 65,000 people from Syria, compared with President Barack Obama's plans to resettle 10,000 people from that country this year. She has never suggested that she would scale back the refugee processing system as it exists today. Late last year, the Obama administration for the first time disclosed details about how refugees are investigated. Officials described a drawn-out process that includes in-person interviews overseas and involves multiple agencies, led by Homeland Security. Refugees must submit to interviews before they can come, and provide biographical details about themselves \u2014 their families, friendships, social or political activities, employment, telephone numbers, email accounts and more. They also provide biometric information, including fingerprints. Syrians are subject to additional, classified controls that officials have declined to describe specifically. Refugee processing generally takes 18 months to 24 months. It can be longer for Syrians. While Trump is wrong to say Syrian refugees undergo no screening or practically none, that's not to say the system is foolproof. Contrary to Trump's assertion that \"there are no papers,\" refugee applicants must provide documentation. But the administration has acknowledged it can be difficult to verify the accuracy or authenticity of documents provided by refugee applicants against foreign government records from countries that don't cooperate with the U.S. government, such as Syria. It can be tough for the U.S. to check foreign government records for local arrests or lesser bureaucratic interactions, such as bank records, business licenses or civil filings. Refugees from Syria in particular tend to provide extensive documents involving their day-to-day lives. They often have family histories, military records and other information that can be useful for American authorities investigating them. ___ TRUMP: \"We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.\" THE FACTS: Trump may be right on his overall description of the U.S. immigration system as \"dysfunctional.\" It's demonstrably false to say the U.S. doesn't know who is being allowed into the country. Illegal immigration along the Mexican border remains a problem. Tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and people traveling as families, mostly from Central America, have arrived at the U.S. border this year. The U.S. still lacks a comprehensive exit system to determine more effectively who has stayed in the country after their visas have expired. But the U.S. government obviously knows who receives the government's permission to legally immigrate into the country. Would-be immigrants, refugees and foreign tourists are all subjected to background checks and various forms of screening. In the case of tourists, people from 38 countries approved for the Visa Waiver Program must submit biographic and other data about themselves before they can legally travel to the United States using the online Electronic System for Travel. People from the approved countries who are also citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria or who have traveled in those countries since March 2011 are generally not eligible to use the visa-free travel program. Tourists from all other countries have to apply for visas and submit to interviews, as well as other vetting.",

            "article_content": "Obama's immigration plan overturned The Justice Department plans to appeal to the Supreme Court in a bid to preserve President Obama's immigration executive actions, after a federal court delivered another blow to the administration's plan. In a 2-1 decision, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld a federal judge's injunction blocking the measure. On Tuesday, the DOJ issued a brief statement saying it would go to the Supreme Court. \"The Department of Justice remains committed to taking steps that will resolve the immigration litigation as quickly as possible in order to allow DHS to bring greater accountability to our immigration system by prioritizing the removal of the worst offenders, not people who have long ties to the United States and who are raising American children,\" DOJ spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said. \"The Department disagrees with the Fifth Circuit's adverse ruling and intends to seek further review from the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Obama ally Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said in a statement he has \"every confidence that the [Supreme Court] will find the actions lawful.\" But the appeals court ruling further dims the prospect of implementation of the executive actions -- which would prevent the deportation of an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants -- before Obama leaves office in 2017. Appeals over the injunction could take months. Depending on how the case unfolds, the injunction could even go back to the Texas federal court for more proceedings. Republicans had criticized the plan as an illegal executive overreach when Obama announced it last November. Twenty-six states challenged the plan in court. U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen granted the temporary injunction preventing the order's implementation this past February, agreeing with the states that legalizing the presence of so many people would be a \"virtually irreversible\" action that would cause the states \"irreparable harm.\" The administration argued that the executive branch was within its rights in deciding to defer deportation of selected groups of immigrants, including children who were brought to the U.S. illegally. \"President Obama should abandon his lawless executive amnesty program and start enforcing the law today,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news release. Part of the initiative included expansion of a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, protecting young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The other major part, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, would extend deportation protections to parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for years. The 70-page majority opinion by Judge Jerry Smith, joined by Jennifer Walker Elrod, rejected administration arguments that the district judge abused his discretion with a nationwide order and that the states lacked standing to challenge Obama's executive orders. They acknowledged an argument that an adverse ruling would discourage potential beneficiaries of the plan from cooperating with law enforcement authorities or paying taxes. \"But those are burdens that Congress knowingly created, and it is not our place to second-guess those decisions,\" Smith wrote. In a 53-page dissent, Judge Carolyn Dineen King said the administration was within the law, casting the decision to defer action on some deportations as \"quintessential exercises of prosecutorial discretion,\" and noting that the Department of Homeland Security has limited resources. \"Although there are approximately 11.3 million removable aliens in this country today, for the last several years Congress has provided the Department of Homeland Security with only enough resources to remove approximately 400,000 of those aliens per year,\" King wrote. Fox News' Shannon Bream and Matt Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry weighs in on efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities on 'The O'Reilly Factor' SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 San Francisco leaders have retained strict protections for people who are in the country illegally, with clarifications. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday for a measure calling for law officers to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement if a defendant is charged with a violent crime and has been convicted of a violent crime within the past seven years. The measure also allows leeway for the city's sheriff to consider contacting federal immigration authorities in the cases of defendants charged with a felony if they have been convicted of other crimes in the past. The vote Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors came nearly a year after a Mexican national was accused of killing a woman along a popular pier. The slaying sparked a national debate on how to handle criminal suspects in the U.S. illegally. Advocates of sanctuary protections say a clear division between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is needed to foster trust. The law dates back to 1989. The proposal's main sponsor, Supervisor John Avalos, and Sheriff Vicki Hennessy had been deadlocked on the issue for weeks as she sought greater discretion to work with ICE. As a constitutionally elected officer, she does not have to follow board orders. Immigration advocates cheered the compromise, even as they maintained that local law enforcement should be entirely separate from federal immigration authorities. The killing of Kate Steinle in July 2015 and the arrest of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez put San Francisco's leaders on the defensive as critics and outside politicians called for a change in the city's sanctuary law. The sheriff at the time cited the law in defending the release of the man, a repeat drug offender and habitual border-crosser. Then-sheriff Ross Mirkarimi \u2014 already embattled over a number of professional and personal gaffes \u2014 lost re-election to Hennessey, who said she would have considered greater communication between the city and federal government. Hennessey said Tuesday that she would not have contacted ICE in the case of Lopez-Sanchez because he was not wanted on a felony.",

They think Donald Trump will handle one of them better than Hillary Clinton, while the candidates tie on the other. A new Fox News Poll on the 2016 election finds more voters trust Trump than Clinton on the economy (+5 points). He also bests Clinton on handling the federal deficit (+5 points). Those are the only issues where he comes out on top. It\u2019s a draw on \u201cterrorism and national security,\u201d as the candidates receive 47 percent apiece. In May, Trump led Clinton by 12 points on doing a better job on \u201cterrorism\u201d (52-40 percent). Equal numbers of voters say the economy and terrorism are the most important issues facing the country today (22 percent each). Education is the only other one to receive double-digit mentions (11 percent). Here\u2019s the rest of the list: race relations (9 percent), the federal deficit (5 percent), health care (5 percent), climate change (4 percent), immigration (3 percent), foreign policy (3 percent), and drug addiction (2 percent). Clinton beats Trump by wide margins on education (+23 points), and on the lower priority concerns: climate change (+31 points), race relations (+28 points), drug addiction (+19 points), foreign policy (+16 points), and health care (+11 points). She also has the advantage on one of Trump\u2019s signature issues -- immigration (+7 points). Who would do better picking the next Supreme Court justice? That\u2019s a hot topic this election. Voters trust Clinton over Trump by eight points. They also think she\u2019s more likely to \u201cpreserve and protect the U.S. Constitution\u201d (+7 points). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS By a 22-point margin, voters trust Clinton over Trump when it comes to using nuclear weapons (56-34 percent). That\u2019s twice the advantage she held in May (49-38 percent). Yet voters are more likely to trust Trump to destroy terrorist groups like ISIS (+9 points). The candidates now tie on restoring trust in government (43-43). That\u2019s a shift since May when Trump had an eight-point advantage (46-38 percent). Despite Trump\u2019s claim that he understands the concerns of everyday Americans, Clinton bests him on empathy. By a 51-40 percent margin, voters say she\u2019ll do a better job looking out for their family during tough economic times. In June 2012, Barack Obama topped Mitt Romney on this measure by 47-36 percent. Poll-pourri How do voters feel about Trump\u2019s praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin? Fifty-two percent of voters say it\u2019s no big deal. For 44 percent, it\u2019s bothersome. Most Republicans say it\u2019s no big deal (72 percent), while two-thirds of Democrats say it bothers them (66 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,022 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from July 31-August 2, 2016.

Sign up\u00a0here.** PRESENTING YOUR KEY COUNTIES FOR ELECTION DAY The national polls seem to have coalesced on the state of the race one day before the 2016 election ends: Democrat Hillary Clinton has the closing momentum and is ahead. But not by much. Clinton\u2019s lead of between 3 points and 4 points in an average of real polls is substantially better than President Obama\u2019s was four years ago when the national average put him about half a point better than Mitt Romney. Obama would go on to win by about 4 points. Political reporters and analysts laughed at the members of the Romney camp four years ago when they swore up and down that the polls were wrong and that the Massachusetts money maestro was actually ahead in their internal surveys and would slingshot past Obama when the voting was done. Campaigns always lie about their polling. It\u2019s like the heights and weights on a football roster: dishonesty is a matter of professional pride. Romney\u2019s team was just a little too emphatic about it. Har-de-har-har\u2026 Republican Donald Trump has mounted an assault against math and public opinion research like he was the VI Corps at Anzio. Trump, who once nuzzled and cooed over every primary poll that showed him in the lead, has rather changed his mind on the subject. But he\u2019s not entirely wrong. Polling is like shooting a shotgun \u2013 a blast pattern of data points spread over a small area to hit a moving target \u2013 not aiming a rifle at a target. Both candidates will likely do better than their current average polling vote shares of about 45 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Trump. Trump can still win. That would require, however, mobilizing an army of older white voters who he and his fellow Republicans believe will storm polling places on Tuesday to put Trump over the top. And if that\u2019s the case, we can\u2019t count on the polls alone. We need to go to where the voters are. With that in mind, come along for a tour of the counties that have among the best track records as bellwethers in their respective states. These are the places that where voters know how to pick \u2018em. Hillsborough County, Florida - The western anchor of the politically potent I-4 corridor, Hillsborough County and the Tampa suburbs were once a Republican stronghold with lots of older voters and military members. But an influx of Hispanic immigrants and younger voters has changed the game. John McCain and Mitt Romney only got about 46 percent of the vote in 2008 and 2012, losing the county on the way to statewide defeats. \u00a0 Merrimack County, New Hampshire - Merrimack County is slightly north of Manchester and what is increasingly becoming part of the greater Boston suburbs. It is the third most populous county in the state that, similar to the state overall, is trending more Democratic. In 2000, Al Gore won this county by a single point, but in 2004 John Kerry won here by 5 points, and President Obama won this county by double-digits in 2008 and 2012. Northampton County, Pennsylvania - Northampton County is located just north of Bucks County in the Philadelphia exurbs. Bethlehem Steel closed in 2003 and shattered the already feeble local economy. Democratic nominees won the county by 6 points in 2000 and just 1 point in 2004. In 2008, Obama won the county by 12 points in 2008 and 5 points in 2012. If Trump is really going to flip Pennsylvania, he\u2019ll do it with the help of lots of voters here. Washoe County, Nevada - The biggest little swing county in the world! Washoe, home to Reno, is the second most populous county in the state. That\u2019s in part due to the gambling and resort scene around Lake Tahoe but also a Hispanic population of about 22 percent and rising. Voters here went big for Bush in 2000, giving him a win by about 10 points but only 4 points four years later. Washoe was the same for Obama who won the county by 12 points but only 4 points in 2012. Fickle much? Jefferson County, Colorado - The county seat of Golden is home to Coors Brewing Company and the Colorado School of Mines, this county was one of the most dramatic political shifts between 2004 and 2008. Bush won this county by about 8 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Obama won here by 9 points in 2008. Although the gap narrowed slightly in 2012, Obama did win again by 5 points, showing that these voters are choosy about who they pick. Saginaw County, Michigan - Saginaw County is part of the Great Lakes Bay Area near Midland and Bay City. Located less than an hour north of Flint, Mich., this county experienced a major depopulation between 2000 and 2012. Similar to its metro area, this county has large black population \u2013 about 19 percent \u2013 but is also home to a lot of working class older white voters. Obama won big here in 2008 and 2012, but these are the kinds of places where Trump hopes to see the tide turn. Caswell County, North Carolina - This former mill town on the Virginia state line is a perfect reflection of North Carolina\u2019s shifting political trends. Romney won here by 2 points in 2012, Obama won by 3 points in 2008, Bush won by 4 points in 2004, and by 2 points in 2000. With a substantial African American population and lots of blue-collar white voters, this was once a Democratic bastion where Trump needs a big swing in his favor. Sandusky County, Ohio - Sandusky on the shore of Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland looks a lot like the rest of northern Ohio: overwhelmingly white, lots of older voters and decades of economic disruption in the rearview mirror. One of the reasons Trump is doing so well in the state is that counties like this one went against type in 2008 and 2012 to back Obama and now are returning to their GOP roots. Bush won here by 12 points in 2004 and 10 points in 2000. Cedar County, Iowa - Located between Cedar Rapids to the west and the Quad Cities to the east, Cedar County reflects the mix of industry and agriculture common to that part of the state. The birthplace of Iowa\u2019s only president, Herbert Hoover, the county has usually had more of a Democratic lean. But in 2000, Al Gore won by only 2 votes and George W. Bush won the county by one percentage point in 2004. That trend ended in 2008 when Obama won by 10 points in 2008 and by 5 points in 2012. Dunn County, Wisconsin - Got milk? Dunn County and its major city, Menomonie, is right in the heart of America\u2019s Dairyland. Out on the Minnesota border and only an hour from the Twin Cities, the voters here have traditionally been stalwart prairie populists of Democratic-Farmer-Labor variety. But there are ways in for the GOP. Other than a blowout for Obama in 2008, Democratic margins are usually small here. If Trump really is the Republican William Jennings Bryan, then he would be able to rock and roll with the folks in western Wisconsin.

But like many things in this election, the volume has been turned up to 11. Trump talks about the Supreme Court more because he has more ground to make up among conservative Republicans.

            "article_content": "Oct. 14, 2016: These booking photos show, from left, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright, and Patrick Eurgene Stein. All three men have been charged with plotting to bomb an apartment building filled with Somali immigrants in Garden City, Kan. (Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office via AP) WICHITA, Kan.  \u2013 Three members of a Kansas militia group were charged Friday with plotting to bomb an apartment complex that's home to Somali immigrants in the western Kansas meatpacking town of Garden City, a thwarted attack prosecutors say was planned for the day after the November election. The arrests were the culmination of an eight-month FBI investigation that took agents \"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Tom Beall said. A complaint unsealed Friday charges Curtis Wayne Allen, 49; Patrick Eugene Stein, 47; and Gavin Wayne Wright, 49, with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. Their first court appearance is Monday. Prosecutors said the men don't yet have attorneys. Publicly listed phone numbers for the men couldn't immediately be found. The men are members of a small militia group that calls itself \"the Crusaders,\" and whose members espouse sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges group members chose the target based on their hatred for Muslims, people of Somali descent and immigrants -- and out of a desire to inspire other militia groups and \"wake people up.\" The FBI began a domestic terrorism investigation of the group in February, and a confidential source attended its meetings in southwestern Kansas. In a June meeting, Stein brought up the Orlando nightclub shooting, and proposed carrying out a similar attack against Muslim refugees in Garden City, according to the complaint. They ultimately decided to target the apartment complex because of the number of Somalis who lived there and the fact that one of the apartments was used as a mosque. The complex houses about 120 Somali residents, Beall said. The complaint said that Stein discussed the explosives used in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh. The men, who were arrested in Liberal on Friday morning, performed surveillance of the apartment building and prepared a manifesto, Beall said. In a profanity-laced conference call that law enforcement monitored, Stein said the only way \"this country's ever going to get turned around is it will be a bloodbath,\" according to the complaint. If convicted, the men could be sentenced to up to life in federal prison without parole. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, called the details of the plot disturbing, saying it \"should serve as a warning to those who traffic in the politics of fear and bigotry.\" Garden City is home to a Tyson Foods beef slaughterhouse that has drawn a diverse immigrant population to the area. Dr. John Birky, a physician who's helping to create a clinic and working with refugees on a language program, said some local residents fear the refugees, mistakenly associating them with militants in Somalia. \"People do express more of a general sentiment of, `Why are we letting these refugees in here? Why are we? They're taking our jobs, plus they're Muslim,\"' he said. Birky said between 300 and 500 Somali refugees live in the area. The state Department for Children and Families said that of the 906 refugees who arrived in Kansas from October 2014 through January 2016, 68 were from Somalia, or 7.5 percent. Garden City Mayor Chris Law said in a statement that he was shocked by the planned attack, and Birky called it \"crazy.\" Birky said most are fleeing militants in Somalia and want to assimilate once they reach Kansas. \"They're trying to make a better life for their families here,\" he said. \"They want to pursue the American dream.\" Friday's arrests and charges prompted the Council on American-Islamic Relations to call on state and federal law enforcement agencies across the nation to increase protection for mosques and other Islamic institutions. The group also cited reports of threats against a Michigan center and anti-Muslim graffiti at a New Jersey mosque. \"We ask our nation's political leaders, and particularly political candidates, to reject the growing Islamophobia in our nation,\" Nihad Awad, the group's national executive director, said in a statement. The case is the latest involving militia groups in the state. Earlier this year, a planned armed protest outside a Wichita mosque prompted the Islamic Society of Wichita to cancel an appearance by a speaker whom protesters believed supported terrorism. The Justice Department's National Security Division created a new position a year ago to help coordinate investigations into violent homegrown extremism, like the one that resulted in the three arrests.",

OBAMA UPSIDE DOWN ONE YEAR AFTER SECOND INAUGURALIt was one year ago today that President Obama took the oath of office to begin his second term. His job approval rating of 52 percent at the time was good enough that the president felt empowered to offer a boldly liberal vision for the next four years. Global warming, gun control, same-sex marriage, amnesty for illegal immigrants, increased taxes and spending and other priorities for the president\u2019s political base all got attention in a speech that is remembered for Obama\u2019s assertion that \u201ccollective action\u201d was required. So how is he doing today? Well\u2026 The agenda is pretty much kaput, the president having whiffed completely on gun control and (so far) been thwarted on \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration changes. Gay couples are increasingly able to marry, but that has seemingly little to do with Obama and much to do with courts and state voters. Global warming is as frozen an issue as a popsicle in a polar vortex. But what about that approval rating? It has flipped completely. The Real Clear Politics Average that showed 52 percent approving of Obama\u2019s performance and 43 percent disapproving a year ago now shows the exact opposite: 52 percent today disapprove of the way Obama is doing the job, while 43 percent approve. [Watch Fox: Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, discusses President Obama\u2019s stalled agenda in the 11 a.m. ET hour] TROLLING: DEMS RENEW PUSH AGAINST VOTER ID LAWS President Obama is set to meet with members of the commission he appointed to probe long-lines that confronted urban voters in the 2012 election. The claim that some mostly-Democratic precincts were intentionally hobbled by Republicans seeking to suppress minority votes has long been a popular conspiracy theory on the left. Even if Obama\u2019s bipartisan commission doesn\u2019t oblige those who see a nefarious red hand in the long lines, Democrats still have their election-year talking points on minority vote suppression ready to go. Vice President Joe Biden used the occasion of Martin Luther King Day to attack the GOP for supporting rules requiring voters to show identification before casting ballots. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d be fighting the fight again on voting rights,\u201d Biden told MSNBC host Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. \u201cOur opponents know the single most dangerous thing to give us is the right to vote.\u201d State fights - In Ohio, Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted uncovered substantial voter fraud and recently reached a settlement with Democrats to allow his office to maintain more accurate voter registration rolls. But Pennsylvania recently saw a court strike down its voter ID law. But the biggest fights are in Texas and North Carolina, both states where Democrats hope to ride a wave of immigrant votes to oust Republicans. Attorney General Eric Holder is asking courts to block the voter ID laws there. Texas\u2019 primary is just six weeks away. One weird trick - As Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s claims of racism show, the issue of voter ID is likely as much about mobilizing Democratic voters as anything else. It combines an attack on Republicans as racist with a plea of increased urgency to minority voters. It\u2019s like the ads that claim \u201cthe one weight-loss trick doctors don\u2019t want you to know.\u201d Democrats can claim Republicans are suppressing their vote, even if those in question wouldn\u2019t be affected by identification laws. It helped keep minority voters agitated in 2012, so perhaps it will work in the midterm races. Certainly, Holders\u2019 litigation and an apparent partnership with MSNBC hosts like Sharpton to focus on the issue will help keep Obama Democrats talking about the topic (at least in whatever time is left after poring over the minutiae of New Jersey politics). OBAMACARE CONTRACT GOES TO CAMPAIGN CONSULTANTFrom Daily Caller: \u201cThe Obama administration gave the latest no-bid Obamacare website contract to a company whose former top analytic researcher developed the complex voter-tracking computer strategies that led Obama to victory in 2012\u2026 The Chicago-based consulting firm Accenture received a $90 million noncompetitive contract to become the Obamacare website\u2019s new primary contractor.

Chris Christie will today deliver an inaugural address to start a second term. In excerpts released ahead of the speech, Christie hearkens back to his own re-election, saying his victory \u201chas taught us that the ways we divide each other - by race, by class, by ethnicity, by wealth, by political party is neither permanent nor necessary.\u201d Christie will exhort: \"The people of this state know that the only way forward is if we are all willing to take on what is politically unpopular. If we are all willing to share in the sacrifice. If we are all willing to be in this together\u2026\u201d \u2018Part of their own success\u2019 - Christie also will tackle the issue of income inequality favored as an election-year topic by Obama Democrats, saying it is important that it is important to require citizens to work hard to gain opportunities for economic advancement so that \u201cthey know they are part of their own success.\u201d From the prepared remarks: \"I do not believe that New Jerseyans want a bigger, more expensive government that penalizes success and then gives the pittance left to a few in the name of income equity. What New Jerseyans want is an unfettered opportunity to succeed in the way they define success. They want an equal chance at the starting; not a government guaranteed result.\u201d DREAMER\u2019s dream - Christie is also heralding New Jersey\u2019s model for compromise legislation: \u201cWe will fight to continue to change government so that we value our differences and honor the strength of our diversity. We cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, DC. The attitude that says I am always right and you are always wrong.\u00a0 The attitude that puts everyone into a box they are not permitted to leave.\u00a0 The attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements.\u00a0 The belief that compromise is a dirty word.\u00a0 As we saw in December regarding the DREAM Act [a law granting in-state tuition rates at state colleges and universities to students in New Jersey illegally], we can put the future of our state ahead of the partisans who would rather demonize than compromise.\u00a0 As your Governor, I will always be willing to listen, as long as that listening ends in decisive action for the people counting on us.\u201d [How is Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer\u2019s claim of bully tactics by Christie\u2019s administration holding up?

DAVIS BLAMES RIVAL FOR BIO BOMBSHELLTexas Democratic gubernatorial frontrunner Wendy Davis says her likely Republican opponent is to blame for a news story that revealed she lied about her biography to cast herself in a more sympathetic light. Davis took to Twitter charging Republican Greg Abbott with making personal attacks on her family, saying Abbott \u201csunk to a new low.\u201d Davis contends Abbott\u2019s campaign was behind a Dallas Morning News article exposing how she had shaded the truth about her biography, hiding the support she received from her second husband, who supported her through college and law school and whom she subsequently divorced. The reporter who wrote the story says he never had any contact with Abbott or his campaign. Matt Hirsch, the Abbott campaign\u2019s communication director responded saying, \u201c\u2026she expects voters to indulge her fanciful narrative. Not only does Sen. Davis hide her donors and contributions, but she\u2019s attempting to hide her past. It's disappointing that a candidate would so cavalierly deceive voters about the most basic aspects of their life, while providing inaccurate testimony in the process \u2026\u201d Davis\u2019 law pals give million dollar boost - Mostyn Law Firm, which made big bucks suing insurance companies in the aftermath of hurricanes Rita and Ike, has donated $1 million dollars to Wendy Davis\u2019 gubernatorial bid.

[NYT explores how the abortion debate is already effecting midterm races] CRIST HIRES TEAM OBAMA Jim Messina, the head of President Obama\u2019s permanent campaign apparatus, Organizing for Action, has hired on to the campaign of Charlie Crist, the former Florida Republican governor who bolted the party after getting upended in a 2010 Senate primary by Marco Rubio. Crist, who subsequently ran for Senate as an independent, is now seeking a return to the governorship as a Democrat. Obama Democrats have previously used Crist\u2019s flight from the GOP to highlight what the president deems the \u201cextreme\u201d policies of the party. Plus, Crist is well-funded, especially by political patrons in the state\u2019s plaintiff\u2019s bar, so Messina can certainly expect to be well compensated. From theTampa Bay Times: \u201cMessina\u2019s role will be as an adviser and strategist. He will not be the campaign manager, a position Crist has yet to fill after his first manager, Bill Hyers, left before he officially starting.\u201d KELLY FILE: ACTRESS OUSTED OVER TEA PARTY SUPPORTActress Maria Chonchita Alonso, famous for her roles in as \u201cThe Running Man\u201d and \u201cMoscow on the Hudson,\u201d told Megyn Kelly that she was forced to quit a role in a production of a play featuring monologues about the female sex organ, after appearing in an ad for Tea Party California gubernatorial hopeful Tim Donnelly.\u00a0 Alonso told Kelly about the backlash from those outraged she would support a conservative candidate saying, \u201cThey were saying they were going to burn down the theater, they were going to boycott [the show].\u201d She added she wished other performers don\u2019t have to go through it.

When he went to return his service pistol, a .40-calibre Glock, to its holster after comparing it to new weapons it became tangled in the fleece jacket he was wearing. He told the Indianapolis Star: \u201cI felt (the gun) go in the holster and I pushed it, but it was tangled in the material which caused it to discharge. The bullet went into my leg and then into the floor.\u201d He was treated and released from the local hospital for a flesh wound to the upper thigh and planned to be back at work today.\u00a0 Counceller recounted to the paper a similar incident 15 years ago when he shot himself in the hand while cleaning his pistol. \u201cThat one really hurt.\u201d As for how it might affect his chances in the election, a rueful Counceller saw at least some upside. \u201cSome candidates are out there doing things for kids to try to get elected.

(AP Photo/John Locher) (The Associated Press) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman) (The Associated Press) Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump listens during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (Mark Ralston/Pool via AP) (The Associated Press) LAS VEGAS \u2013 Here is The Latest news from the third and final presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, less than three weeks before the Nov. 8 election (all times EDT): 10:33 p.m. Hillary Clinton says imposing a no-fly zone over Syria can save lives on the ground while speeding the end of the fighting in that country. She acknowledges in the third and final debate with Donald Trump that enforcing a no-fly zone \"would take a lot of negotiation.\" Clinton says she thinks \"we could strike a deal\" and make it clear to Russian and Syrian leaders that \"this was the best for people on the ground.\" Donald Trump is responding that Clinton would allow potential terrorists into the United States as refugees from Syria. Clinton counters that she wouldn't allow refugees to immigrate without being properly vetted, but says she also wouldn't close U.S. borders to women and children fleeing war. ___ 10:30 p.m. Donald Trump is again asserting that U.S. involvement in the war-torn city of Aleppo, Syria, is not a worthwhile cause. Aleppo is the center of the years-long Syrian civil war between President Bashar Assad and rebel forces. Russia is backing Assad. Trump says Aleppo is a \"humanitarian nightmare\" but suggests that keeping Assad in power may be better than replacing him, because Assad and Russia both oppose the Islamic State group. Trump says the United States would be in better shape if it had \"done nothing\" in Syria. The United States has protested Russia's bombardment of Aleppo. It says civilians are being slaughtered to prop up Assad's regime. ___ 10:26 p.m. Donald Trump is once again denying that he supported the invasion of Iraq. Trump said \"Wrong\" in Wednesday's final presidential debate when Hillary Clinton said he supported the invasion in 2002. Trump actually offered lukewarm support for invading Iraq before the war began. He's repeatedly and erroneously claimed to have come out against the war before it started, telling Howard Stern in September 2002: \"Yeah I guess so,\" when asked if he would back an invasion. Clinton says in the debate that anyone questioning what Trump's position was could simply google it and find \"dozens of sources\" showing he was for it. Clinton says,\" He has not told the truth on that position.\" ___ 10:25 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she's \"encouraged\" by the Iraqi-led offensive to retake the city of Mosul. Donald Trump says it's only an issue because the Obama administration \u2014 and Clinton while at the State Department \u2014 pulled troops from Iraq in the first place. Clinton outlined her military plan to take out the Islamic State group. She said coalition forces should push the fight into the group's Syrian headquarters after Mosul is retaken. She also called for an \"intelligence surge\" online and on the ground focused on the Islamic State. Trump is not detailing his plan. He says, \"What ever happened to the element of surprise?\" ___ 10:22 p.m. Donald Trump tried to lighten a serious moment in the debate as Hillary Clinton listed other times he claimed something was \"rigged\" just because he wasn't winning. She noted there was even a time he chided the Emmy Awards for not recognizing his reality series \"Celebrity Apprentice\" three years in a row. As Clinton was making that point, Trump began smiling and shrugging. He interjected, \"Should have gotten it.\" The audience laughed a bit, as Clinton continued. \"This is a mindset,\" she said. Clinton added that his comments about not necessarily accepting the election results are a dangerous departure from the nation's democratic traditions. ___ 10:19 p.m. Hillary Clinton calls Donald Trump's refusal to promise to accept results of the presidential election \"horrifying.\" She said Trump has a history of calling things rigged, including the Republican primary, the court system handling a case against Trump University and the Emmys. Clinton says the U.S. has a tradition of accepting election outcomes, and any general election candidate must be expected to do that. ___ 10:15 p.m. Donald Trump is again refusing to promise that he'd accept defeat on Nov. 8 if Americans choose Hillary Clinton as the 45th president. The Republican nominee says he'll \"look at it at the time.\" He was responding to moderator Chris Wallace's specific questions about whether he would honor the American tradition of the presidential loser conceding to the president-elect. When Wallace pressed him again, Trump responded again that he'd \"keep you in suspense.\" Trump has argued that the national media is trying to rig the election. He is again stating without any evidence that \"millions\" of registered voters \"shouldn't be registered.\" And he suggests Clinton would be an illegitimate president because of her use of a private email server when secretary of state. He says she \"never should have been allowed to run.\" ___ 10:10 p.m. Donald Trump is saying his foundation is a benefit to society. Trump was responding to attacks from Hillary Clinton over his foundation spending money on a portrait of himself. He said it is a small, personal foundation that he donates to. The Washington Post has reported that Trump hasn't donated to his foundation for years. It also cited records showing Trump used foundation money to settle a legal dispute against his club, Mar-a-Lago. Trump denied his foundation has done this. ___ 10:08 p.m. Donald Trump says the Clinton Foundation is a \"criminal enterprise\" and is calling on Hillary Clinton to have the foundation return money it's received from countries with repressive human rights regimes. There is no evidence the Clinton Foundation has broken any laws. Trump also says the Clinton Foundation's work in Haiti was a \"disgrace.\" Clinton says she is \"thrilled\" to discuss the foundation's work, and says it is a world-renowned charity that has helped millions of people. She also says there was no improper connection between the foundation's donors and those awarded contracts to help rebuild Haiti after it suffered a devastating earthquake. ___ 10:05 p.m. Donald Trump is suggesting that accusations of his inappropriate behavior with women over the years were started by Hillary Clinton and her \"sleazy campaign.\" Asked about the many women who have come forward to accuse Trump, the Republican presidential nominee called the accusations \"fiction\" and blamed Clinton. But he then quickly pivoted. Trump accused Clinton of deleting her emails while serving as secretary of state to hide potentially disclosing classified information, saying \"she's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress and to the FBI.\" Clinton responded that when Trump \"is pushed\" on any major issue, he immediately unleashes denials that are bullying and beside the point. Trump responded, \"Wrong.\" ___ 10:04 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama paid people to incite violence ahead of his planned rally in Chicago earlier this year. There's no clear evidence of that. Trump was referencing secretly record, selectively edited video footage released this week by conservative activist James O'Keefe. Among the footage was a woman who says she was at the Chicago event in March, which Trump canceled because of safety concerns. The woman, identified as Zulema Rodriguez, has attended several Trump events as a protester. Rodriguez said on the O'Keefe recordings that she was paid to be in Chicago. Federally filed finance reports show she was paid about $1,600 by the campaign at the end of February, before the Chicago rally. ___ 10:03 p.m. Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump \"thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\" And she's accusing him of going after women's \"dignity\" and \"self-worth.\" Clinton is making the case against Trump's treatment of women, saying, \"I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\" Clinton's comments come in response to allegations from several women that Trump groped or kissed them without consent. He's denying the charges. But Clinton is noting that he brushed off the remarks by belittling several of the women's appearances. Trump is denying he suggested some of the women weren't attractive enough to win his attention. But he said of one recently, \"believe me, she would not be my first choice.\" ___ 10 p.m. Donald Trump says claims by women who say he groped them have been largely debunked, even though they have not. Trump is also claiming in Wednesday's debate that he thinks Hillary Clinton's campaign is behind the women coming forward, even though there is no evidence of that, either. Trump says, \"I believe she got these people to step forward.\" He calls the women's stories \"lies and fiction.\" He says, \"I don't know those people.\" Clinton says, \"Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\" She says Trump attacks women's dignity and self-worth and says: \"That's who Donald is. I think it's up to us to demonstrate who we are.\" ___ 9:57 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton may have more experience than he does, \"but it's bad experience.\" He says, \"The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.\" Clinton is responding by comparing her record over the decades to Trump's. She notes that on the day she was in the White House's situation room during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Trump was hosting the NBC show \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" She says, \"I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience\" to Trump's. ___ 9:55 p.m. Donald Trump is back to his usual bluster on the debate stage. The GOP nominee had largely held his tongue during the first half-hour of Wednesday's final debate, speaking only when called on and not interrupting. But Trump appears to be sliding back to his usual bluster as he and Hillary Clinton discuss Russia and nuclear weapons. \"Wrong!\" he declared at one point, interrupting Clinton. Later, Clinton said she would \"translate\" Trump's plan to reform the tax code. Trump interjected, \"You can't.\" ___ 9:54 p.m. Donald Trump is making a misleading charge that Hillary Clinton will double \"your taxes.\" Clinton's tax plan would only raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. Even then it would only add 4 percent to the top rate, not double it. She would require people making more than $1 million annually to pay at least 30 percent in federal taxes. She'd also limit some tax deductions. So the only people whose taxes could be doubled are those making a large amount of money and paying very little in taxes. Trump has proposed a large across-the-board tax cut. Analysts say he'd actually raise taxes on some single parents because of the structure of the plan. ___ 9:52 p.m. Hillary Clinton is continuing to defend Democratic economic priorities as the way to help the most Americans. She insists her tax-and-spending priorities would \"not add a penny to the debt,\" because she would raise taxes on top-income earners while investing in programs she says will benefit middle-class Americans and grow the economy. She says her philosophy is to \"invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.\" She says Republican Donald Trump proposes tax plans tilted toward the wealthiest Americans. Clinton is also defending President Barack Obama's economic record. ___ 9:50 p.m. Donald Trump says his plan to boost the economy is to make the United States' rich allies pay more for military support and to renegotiate trade deals. Trump also says he would cut taxes \"massively.\" Trump is naming several allies he says could afford to pay the U.S. for its spending on defense. He says, \"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia, why aren't they paying?\" The Republican presidential nominee is also criticizing current trade deals, saying he would renegotiate them to get better terms for the U.S. or leave them. Trump says NAFTA, signed by former President Bill Clinton, was one of the \"worst deals ever\" and was causing U.S. jobs to flee to Mexico and other countries. ___ 9:48 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she will grow the American economy by focusing on the middle class and building the largest job-creation program since World War II. Asked to detail her economic strategy, Clinton says she wants to create new clean energy jobs that will also help the environment. She pledges to raise the national minimum wage and declares that women should get \"equal pay for the work we do,\" meaning reducing the wage gap with their male counterparts. Clinton also calls for more early education and technical training in high schools, and to reduce student debt \u2014 all of which will be difficult without major public spending increases. ___ 9:46 p.m. Donald Trump says he \"of course\" condemns Russia or any other country interfering in the U.S. elections. Still, he says he doesn't necessarily believe Russia hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign. U.S. intelligence officials believe Russia is behind the hacks. Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin is not \"my best friend,\" but says the Russian leader has \"outsmarted\" Clinton repeatedly. Democrats have slammed Trump for calling Putin a stronger leader than President Barack Obama. Trump is alleging Clinton has allowed Russia to expand its nuclear weapons. Clinton, in response, says Trump is \"cavalier\" about nuclear weapons, pointing to his past statements suggesting more countries should have nuclear power. The two have repeatedly sparred over Russia's role in the world, with Democrats alleging Trump would strengthen Moscow and Trump saying Clinton is too weak to take on Putin. ___ 9:45 p.m. Donald Trump is disagreeing with U.S. intelligence officials who have concluded that Russia has hacked political emails. Hillary Clinton notes that some of Donald Trump's foreign policies line up with Russia's and that he's called for Russian hackers to find her emails. She contends that Russia hacked her campaign's emails to help Trump. The emails were recently released through the web site WikiLeaks. Trump says Clinton has no idea if Russia or someone else was behind the hacks. Clinton counters that 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia is the culprit. ___ 9:44 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton supports open borders for immigration and he's quoting from hacked emails released by WikiLeaks to prove it. Trump is quoting part of the speech that was kept secret before the hacked emails were released. Clinton said in a private speech that her \"dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.\" Clinton correctly points out that she went on to say that vision includes \"energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\" She says she was talking about open borders for energy, not immigration. ___ 9:42 p.m. What is this that the presidential candidates have been talking about? Oh, it's policy! So far in this third debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are debating their very different approaches to some of the country's stickiest issues: gun rights, abortion and immigration. That's a striking turnabout from how the previous two debates have unfolded in their earliest moments. Last time the two met, in St. Louis, the debate moderators began by asking about the increasingly negative tone of the campaign, focusing on a 2005 video of Trump making predatory comments about women. This time, right off the top in Las Vegas, it was all policy. There are signs the issues focus may not last: Clinton and Trump have begun sniping at each other about ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ 9:40 p.m. Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump \"choked\" during a meeting with the Mexican president when he failed to bring up his own plan to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. Clinton says she voted for border security and believes the U.S. is a country of laws, but also a nation of immigrants. She said she's against ripping families apart, noting that there are an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country who have 4 million American-citizen children. She is portraying Trump's deportation plan as a logistical nightmare, saying it would force a \"massive law enforcement presence\" and require shipping people from the country in trains and buses. She says she would push for an immigration reform plan within her first 100 days of office. ___ 9:37 p.m. Hillary Clinton is accusing Donald Trump of employing immigrants in the country illegally. The Democratic presidential nominee charges that her Republican opponent \"exploit(ed) undocumented workers.\" Trump is not refuting the charge. He is repeating his promise to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally if elected. He notes that President Barack Obama has also deported millions of immigrants. Trump hired a contracting firm that employed immigrants in the country to help build Trump Tower in New York. He settled a related court case out of court. ___ 9:35 p.m. Donald Trump is highlighting his hard-line immigration strategy as a way to get \"bad hombres\" out of the United States. The Republican presidential hopeful reaffirms he would build a wall on the Mexican border and deport \"some bad, bad people in this country,\" then figure out who could be readmitted. He blames some \"bad hombres here\" for drug epidemics around the country, and he promises \"we're going to get 'em out.\" Trump's proposal for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border helped fuel his rise to the Republican Party nomination. He is misrepresenting Hillary Clinton's immigration policy. He says she supports \"open borders\" and \"amnesty\" for people already here illegally. Clinton supports a more lenient policy than Trump. But she still supports a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would include requiring people here illegally to pay back taxes and other penalties. ___ 9:32 p.m. A much more disciplined and restrained Donald Trump is on stage at the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas. Trump spent much of the first two debates constantly interrupting rival Hillary Clinton and drawing attention to himself as she spoke with his pacing and animated facial expressions. This time, Trump is largely waiting to speak until he's asked questions and declining to interrupt \u2014 even when Clinton accused him of calling for women to be punished if abortions are outlawed. While Trump did say that during a town hall event, he later issued a statement clarifying that was not his stance. ___ 9:28 p.m. Hillary Clinton is adamant that government should stay out of women's health issues. Clinton is pushing back forcefully in responding to Donald Trump's criticism of Clinton's support for women to be able to have late-term abortions. \"This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make, and I do not believe the government should be making it,\" Clinton said. Clinton notes that she has traveled to countries where governments have forced women to have abortions or to have children. ___ 9:27 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she supports a woman's right to undergo a late-term abortion, saying \"the United States government shouldn't be stepping in\" on \"the most-personal\" of decisions. Clinton says current federal law protects \"partial-birth\" abortion and she would keep it that way as president. She says she has met women undergoing the \"heartbreaking\" procedure for health reasons. Donald Trump says, \"I think it's terrible.\" He is likening partial-birth abortions to allowing women to \"rip the baby out of the womb\" in the ninth month or even on the last day of pregnancy. ___ 9:25 p.m. Donald Trump says he thinks Roe v. Wade will \"automatically\" be overturned if he is elected because he will appoint justices who oppose abortion rights. Trump says he is against abortion rights but did not give a straight answer on whether he personally thinks the landmark abortion case should be overturned. He is saying he will appoint justices who would likely do so. Trump says it would then be up to states to decide whether abortion should remain legal and what restrictions should be placed on it. Hillary Clinton says she'll strongly defend Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood. ___ 9:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton is criticizing one of the Supreme Court's biggest recent decisions. Clinton disagrees with the 2008 Heller decision that found the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms for self-defense. Clinton says she supports the Second Amendment but thinks the court prevented a reasonable attempt to make guns safer. It struck down the District of Columbia's requirements for a trigger lock on all guns. Republican Donald Trump says this is one of the reasons supporters of the Second Amendment don't trust Clinton. ___ 9:15 p.m. Donald Trump is opening the final presidential debate by promising to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold Second Amendment gun rights, saying it is \"under such trauma.\" The first question in Wednesday's debate focused on what kind of justices Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton would appoint to the high court. Trump says he would appoint judges who are \"pro-life,\" have a \"conservative bent\" and will protect gun ownership rights. Trump says, \"The Supreme Court is what it's all about.\" He says it's \"imperative that we have the right justices.\" Trump has released the name of 20 potential nominees to the Supreme Court and has emphasized the high number of potential appointments the next president may make. Trump also says the Constitution should be interpreted \"the way the founders wanted it.\" ___ 9:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she supports a Supreme Court that stands \"on the side of the American people\" and not the \"powerful corporations and the wealthy.\" The Democrat's comments were part of her first response in Wednesday night's third and final debate. The former secretary of state specifically said the nation's high court should not reverse its decisions on abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Clinton said it should, however, reverse its Citizens United decision that allows \"dark\" money into politics. She added that the Senate has a responsibility to act on a president's Supreme Court pick. ___ 9:05 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have kicked off their third and final debate without shaking hands, continuing a break from decorum that began at their last showdown in St. Louis. The two stepped onto the stage in Las Vegas from opposite sides, each briefly waving to the audience before immediately moving behind their podiums. The less-than-civil tone extended to the candidates' families. They, too, entered separately, unlike at the previous two debates, and did not cross paths or shake hands. At the second debate, Bill Clinton and Melania Trump greeted each other before taking their seats. But that night Trump's campaign had tried to parade three women who'd accused Clinton of sexual misconduct past him \u2014 a plan the nonpartisan debate commission nixed just before it could be carried out. ___ 8:17 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are preparing to face off on the debate stage for the final time. But before the showdown, Trump has issued an invitation to his Facebook page to join his team live at 8:30 p.m. EDT. Before the last debate, Trump appeared on the same platform with three women who have accused rival Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, of sexual assault. The former president has denied the accusations. Trump then sat the women in the debate hall. At Wednesday's final debate, Trump was expected to bring a woman who has accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, the mother of a man who was killed in the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi and President Barack Obama's half-brother. Clinton guests include CEO Mark Cuban, basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. For now, at least, Clinton has a significant lead in most polls. Trump's team says he's planning to be aggressive on the debate stage. ___ 8:02 p.m. Billionaire businessman and leading Donald Trump critic Mark Cuban is making the rounds at the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, and Hillary Clinton's campaign insists their high-profile guest is not here to troll the Republican nominee. Clinton's communications chief Jen Palmieri called Cuban \"a very accomplished, serious business leader in our country.\" And she touted him as \"one of our most effective advocates\" who \"makes a really strong case for why Hillary Clinton will be a great president.\" Palmieri says Clinton has no regrets about inviting Cuban to the first debate, and says it has nothing to do with Trump's invitation list for the second debate. Trump invited three women who have accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment and other misdeeds. His guests in Las Vegas include President Barack Obama's half-brother. Palmieri says \"however Donald Trump chooses to react is his choice,\" and she argues that the Trump campaign \"telegraphed well in advance of the debates\" their intention to take a \"nasty turn\" in the campaign. ___ 7:58 p.m. Donald Trump's spokesman says Hillary Clinton will have an opportunity during the debate to apologize to the mother of a man who was killed in the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi. Trump spokesman Jason Miller says the Republican nominee will press the issue whether the debate moderator asks about it or not. Miller made the comments Wednesday in an interview shortly before the debate. Trump's campaign confirmed that its guests inside the debate hall would include Pat Smith, whose son was an IT consultant killed in the deadly Benghazi attacks. Smith has accused Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, of lying to her about what sparked the violence.",

Rick Perry is taking the next step today as he is expected to order 1,000 members of the Texas National Guard to defend the Rio Grande Valley amid an ongoing surge in illegal immigration. The plan, outlined in a memo leaked by a Democratic state legislator who opposes the idea, would put the troops in place over the span of a month with the aim of freeing federal immigrations and border officials to attend to the tens of thousands of migrant minors already in U.S. custody. [Watch Fox: Texas Gov. Rick Perry holds press conference on border security at 3 p.m. ET.]Previewed in Iowa campaign stop - Des Moines Register: \u201cIf the federal government doesn't send more troops and aid to the secure the U.S. border with Mexico, the state of Texas will act unilaterally, Gov. Rick Perry told a small crowd of veterans [in Iowa] Sunday afternoon. \u2026 When pressed later, though, he declined to offer a timeline for when the state would give up on additional federal intervention and act on its own.\u201d [Flashback - Watch Texas Gov. Rick Perry joust with Fox News Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume on sending troops to the border during a recent \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d appearance.]Risks, rewards - For Perry, this represents a risky gambit. The memo says the price tag would be as much as $12 million a month, not an insignificant sum in a state that is having an testy election-year fight over spending. But Perry, having forced President Obama to meet him to discuss the border crisis during a recent fundraising jaunt through Texas, is pretty clearly looking to press his advantage. The slow-motion disaster at the boarder has left Democrats and Republicans alike calling for the president to take more urgent action than complaining about Republican unwillingness to appropriate new money for the care and housing of the juveniles. For Perry, it is also a way to solidify his position as the hawks\u2019 favorite for 2016. As his term in office winds down after 14 years as governor \u2013 the longest of any in the nation \u2013 outbidding Obama for border security will endear him to Republican voters and further erase the marks 2012 rival Mitt Romney left in attacks on Texas\u2019 immigration policies.Squeeze play - For Obama, he finds himself trapped between public opinion that is squarely against his handling of the crisis and a Democratic base that is increasingly unwilling to tolerate the mass deportation of the asylum-seeking Central American youths. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is reaching out to the amnesty absolutists, as the \u201cRun Liz, Run!\u201d movement gets out of the starting blocks. The 2016 Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, is on the record favoring mass deportations, but for how long? With the left wing flapping and Warren ascendant, Clinton might be spurred to rethink her pro-enforcement policy. By not taking action on the border beyond demanding more money from Congress, Obama has let his party drift into some uncomfortable places. [Warned of migrant surge, administration called it a \u2018local problem\u2019 - Fox News: \u201cThe Obama administration ignored a report to the Department of Homeland Security last year which predicted that a large number of unaccompanied children would arrive at America's southern border in the coming months, according to a published report.]RAND FOCUSES ON ISRAELNational Journal: \u201cWhen [Sen.

His top strategist, Doug Stafford, packaged the speech into an email that landed in the in-boxes of a clutch of influential Jewish and pro-Israel Republicans across the country. The episode\u2014the pro-Israel bill, the impassioned speech, the rapid dissemination\u2014is a small window into the early and aggressive Jewish-outreach campaign of the junior senator from Kentucky with his eye on the White House in 2016. As Paul lays the groundwork for a presidential bid\u2014he's already hired two top Iowa Republicans and one veteran New Hampshire strategist\u2014few constituencies have received more attention than Jewish Republicans and pro-Israel advocates. \u2019\u201d [Watch Fox: Bret Baier interviews Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mustafa Barghouti, General Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative Partytonight on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d at 6 p.m. ET][Washington Times: \u201cBen Carson won the Western Conservative Summit\u2019s annual presidential straw poll Sunday, capping a three-day extravaganza billed as the \u201crally on the right.\u201d Mr. Carson took 22 percent of the vote, followed by Sen.

A magnificent office!\u2019 And he laughed. As I turned, I was this close to him.\u2019 Biden held his hand a few inches from his nose. \u2018I said, \u2018Mr. Prime Minister, I\u2019m looking into your eyes, and I don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u2019 \u2018 \u2018You said that?\u2019 I asked. It sounded like a movie line. \u2018Absolutely, positively,\u2019 Biden said, and continued, \u2018And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, \u2018We understand one another.\u2019 Biden sat back, and said, \u2018This is who this guy is!\u2019\u201dHillary\u2019s heft helpers - Bloomberg: \u201cHillary Clinton has earned at least $12 million in 16 months since leaving the State Department, a windfall at odds with her party\u2019s call to shrink the gap between the rich and the poor. Clinton\u2019s income since her resignation as secretary of state in February 2013 is derived mostly from her latest memoir, speeches and paid appearances at corporate retreats, according to an analysis of data compiled by Bloomberg. At least 12 organizations that previously booked President Bill Clinton -- who has been paid almost $106 million in speaking fees alone since he left the White House -- also hired his wife. Among them: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the National Association of Realtors. \u2026 Her earnings represent a fraction of the Clinton family\u2019s total income and yet were large enough to rank her not only in the top 1 percent of the nation\u2019s earners but in the top one-hundredth of the 1 percent.\u201dBubba claims he hasn\u2019t advised wife on 2016 run - Former President Bill Clinton, in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newsnight, claimed that his wife has not asked him his opinion of her 2016 prospects: \u201cWe were married a very long time when she was always, in effect, deferring to my political career. I told her when she got elected to the Senate from New York that she\u2019d given me 26 years, and so I intended to give her 26 years. Whatever she wanted to do was fine with me. If she wanted to know my opinion, I would tell her, but she had carte blanche to make whatever decisions she wanted, and tell me what I was supposed to do about it.\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...On this the 45 anniversary of man\u2019s first walk on the moon, Discover\u2019s Cory Powell, talks about a pioneering member of that long journey. \u201cOne hundred years ago this week, Robert H. Goddard received a pioneering patent for a liquid-fueled rocket\u2013just like the one that took Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins to the moon. It was the one small step that\u00a0led\u00a0to one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u2026Goddard\u2019s experiments captured the imagination of both like-minded engineers and the general public\u2013both elements that were crucial to the birth of NASA and the intensifying sequence of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs that led to human footsteps on the moon. Not that it was all smooth sailing for Goddard. In a famously nasty 1920 editorial,\u00a0The New York Times ridiculed his ideas about rocketry, declaring that his claim that a rocket could fly in the vacuum of space would \u2018deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr. Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.\u2019 (On July 17, 1969, as Apollo 11 was racing moonward, the\u00a0Times\u00a0published a gently self-mocking correction: \u2018Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere.

League of Women Voters and WECT-TV (Wilmington). That date has not been set.\u201dKINGSTON, PERDUE PUT IN LAST PUSHWXIA: \u201cThe longest runoff election in Georgia history ends on Tuesday, after two months of handshakes, campaign stops and negative ads. The two candidates for the Republican Senate race will be crisscrossing the state on the final day before the polls open. Congressman Jack Kingston plans a statewide fly around with former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, who backed the congressman after she lost in the May primary. Businessman David Perdue has seven stops planned on his Monday fly around\u2026. Turnout will be key. Before early voting ended on Friday, 119,000 people cast their ballot. That\u2019s about 50,000 fewer people than in the primary back in May. Fewer voters, means a lower margin of error. Which is why each campaign has been honing in on its grassroots supporters. \u2026The winner between Kingston and Perdue will be facing off against Michelle Nunn in the general election. Nunn, mind you, just raised $3.5 million in the last three months -- a lot of money to spend on ads.\u201dGowdy backs Kingston \u2013 A congressman from Georgia\u2019s northern neighbor put last-minute support behind state Rep. Jack Kingston in his race to be the GOP Senate nominee in the Peach State. According to Kingston\u2019s camp, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., pointed to Kingston\u2019s record of voting against wasteful spending and Wall Street bailout while his opponent, businessman David Perdue, supported part of Obama\u2019s spending plans.PAPA CRUZ AND DRIVES FOR CARRChattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press: \u201cHe didn\u2019t come right out with an endorsement, but the father of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was clearly on the same page with Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Carr in back-to-back speeches Saturday before hundreds of tea party activists here. Carr, a state representative from Lascassas who\u2019s hoping to knock off Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., in the Aug. 7 primary, denounced Democratic President Barack Obama as a \u2018tyrant.\u2019 In his own speech, Pastor Rafael Cruz, who fled Cuba decades ago, likened Obama to former Cuban Communist dictator Fidel Castro. Cruz's son, Texas\u2019 junior senator, is beloved by many conservatives. And both men praised the writers of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution as divinely inspired. So it went at the \u2018We the People Rally\u2019 sponsored by the Nashville Tea Party that drew activists from across the state\u2026.And, though many Tennessee-based tea party groups are backing Carr, he has struggled to win financial support from several national groups like the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund. But the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund is getting involved in the Tennessee race. Conservative talk radio show host Laura Ingraham, who last week declared she's \u2018all in\u2019 for Carr, is coming here Tuesday to headline a rally for him.\u201dAlexander ignores attacks - Memphis (Tenn.) Commercial Appeal: \u201cState Rep. Joe Carr, the most formidable of Alexander\u2019s six Republican primary challengers, has pummeled him relentlessly, arguing the deal-making senator is out of touch and isn\u2019t conservative enough for Tennessee votes. Alexander\u2019s response to Carr\u2019s attacks has been to basically ignore him. He never mentions Carr by name on the campaign trail or in conversations with reporters. He has refused Carr\u2019s calls for a debate, saying at this point in the campaign \u2013 early voting started Friday \u2013 that putting all seven candidates on a stage and letting them go at each other would not be of much use to voters. Alexander, 74, certainly doesn\u2019t act like a man who\u2019s worried that his days in office might soon be over, as tea party activists like to boast.\u201dBRALEY MISSED 78 PERCENT OF VETS COMMITTEE MEETINGSIowa Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Bruce Braley is getting a taste of his own medicine on absenteeism. Braley\u2019s backers had attacked Republican nominee, state Sen. Joni Ernst, for missing votes in the state legislature. But now it\u2019s Braley\u2019s attendance record that is under scrutiny as Republicans hammer him for missing more than two thirds of the hearings of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee on which he serves. The Cedar Rapids Gazette checked the claim and found that while Braley had a better attendance rate for subcommittee hearings, the charge was fairly rendered. \u201cWith an absentee rate of 78 percent on the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, it\u2019s clear Braley thinks his time is better spent pushing Barack Obama\u2019s job-killing agenda than ensuring that our veterans receive proper care from the VA,\u201d said Iowa Republican Party spokesman Jahan Wilcox in a statement.#2016 - Des Moines Register: \u201cRepublican Joni Ernst has gone silent while on two weeks of active duty, but her campaign has kept up a steady drumbeat in her absence. The U.S. Senate candidate cannot engage in any political activities while she\u2019s on duty at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin until July 26, so her campaign aides have been posting photos of Republicans who say they\u2019re \u2018on duty for Joni\u2019 while she\u2019s away. Among those in photos tweeted by @JoniforIowa are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who did a jam-packed one-day Iowa trip on Thursday, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is Iowa now for two days of fundraising.\u201dDAINES TOUTS WORK FOR VETERANS IN NEW ADSenate hopeful Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., will debut a new TV ad hitting airwaves across Montana today and focusing on his work to fight injustices challenging Montana Veterans.\u00a0 The 30 second spot features George Blackard, veteran from Billings, Mont., highlighting the hardships he has experienced as a veteran. \u201cWe had a situation where deceased veterans were denied grave markers at our cemetery. That\u2019s an injustice and it should never happen,\u201d Blackard says. \u201cSteve Daines was one of the first people in Washington D.C. to speak out. He took swift action. He got a commitment from the VA to fix that problem.\u201d Daines challenges incumbent Sen.

Fox News First reader Nadine Sutham agrees that Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota will be turn-overs for the GOP. But she also points to Iowa and Colorado as two other states that could help the Republicans gain control of the Senate.On the bubble - Just a handful of reader votes away from Pick Six membership is Alaska (9%). The Frontier State contest pits Sen. Mark Begich, a vulnerable Democrat who as a self-proclaimed \u201cthorn in President Obama\u2019s side,\u201d has been running away from the president\u2019s energy policies and ObamaCare, against the Republican challenger \u2013 most likely former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan or Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell \u2013 who emerges from the state\u2019s primary now just one month away. Heavy outside funding has been pouring into the state, most recently a $3.5 million boost to the Begich-backing group Put Alaska First by the Senate Majority PAC, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid\u2019s political action committee. While national polls show Sullivan as the GOP frontrunner, some local polls show his contest with Treadwell tightening. Throw in the wild-card factor of firebrand Joe Miller and there\u2019s plenty of drama in the land of the midnight sun.

His signature roles as Bret Maverick, Jim Rockford and Murphy Jones captured viewers, portraying a humble hero with a witty, gallant and warm personality. But did you know Garner, a native Oklahoman, was also a longtime political activist, dating back to his time in the Civil Rights era and a self-described \u201cbleeding heart liberal?\u201d In his 2011 book, Garner revealed that Democratic leaders approached him to run for governor of California in 1990, but Garner quickly put a stop to the talk of him becoming the blue team\u2019s answer to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan. \u201cThere\u2019s one difference between me and them: I know I\u2019m not qualified,\u201d Garner wrote.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "Legal panel breaks down heated case from Texas The Supreme Court on Monday is poised to once again enter the fray on the abortion issue, an already divisive subject complicated by election-year politics and a split bench that may lack the votes to rule definitively. The high court will wrap up its work for the summer by issuing a judgment on how far Texas can go to regulate abortion clinics in the state, and whether those provisions have the effect of limiting first-trimester abortions guaranteed by the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.\u00a0Texas reproductive clinics are asking the justices to keep their facilities open in the face of the state restriction. Activists on both sides of the issue are expected to rally outside the court when the ruling is announced. A 4-4 tie would sustain the lower court's ruling, meaning a default victory for Texas, and likely for similar laws in other nearby states, including Louisiana and Mississippi. But no legal precedent would be established, leaving continued uncertainty nationwide. The Supreme Court could later hear new arguments in the case, when a ninth justice has been sworn in to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Tied rulings are becoming common for the post-Scalia court. The justices last week ruled 4-4 on a closely watched immigration case, dealing a setback to President Obama's executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. Scalia, who died in February, was perhaps the most outspoken of the current justices in regards to the abortion issue. A year ago, he, along with three other conservative members of the court, opposed issuing an order delaying enforcement of the Texas law while the case was being appealed. The four liberal justices -- along with swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy -- gave a temporary victory to the clinics in that case, allowing them to remain fully operational. It suggests there may now be five votes to ultimately strike down the Texas restrictions. The oral arguments from March were especially tense, though. Kennedy asked tough questions of both sides and did not tip his hand on how he would ultimately vote. If upheld, all clinics performing the abortion procedure in the state must operate as certified \"ambulatory surgical centers\" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority legislature have said the regulations contained in the 2013 law -- known as H.B. 2 -- would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups counter that the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. Only nine or 10 such health centers would qualify to stay open, and large areas west and south of San Antonio would have no full-time abortion providers. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. A federal judge initially concluded the \"ambulatory surgical centers\" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. But a federal appeal court ruled largely in favor of Texas. The clinics then asked the justices to finally decide the matter. \"There was a lot of talk at arguments about what impact this has on clinics,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department officials in the George W. Bush administration, now a private appellate attorney. \"So it could be the court is working behind the scenes to fashion some sort of compromise resolution where they basically punt, at least for the time being on the constitutional issue, and send the case back for more evidence gathering\" by the lower courts. But some court watchers on the progressive side worry what a tie vote would mean in the short term. \"It will definitely be a dramatic example of the problems of having a mere eight-justice court,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"And if the court splits 4-4 they will leave in place a difference of opinion, in the circuits [courts] below. That means women would enjoy their fundamental rights differently based on the state in which they live and this is not how our Constitution works.\" A Fox News poll from August revealed an even public split on the abortion issue, which has inevitably become enmeshed in presidential election-year politics. Among registered voters, 47 percent surveyed favor abortion rights or consider themselves \"pro-choice\" while 46 percent oppose the procedure or are \"pro-life.\" The number of abortions is at the lowest level since the Roe v. Wade decision, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute. The number remained steady at about 1.1 million reported procedures in the year 2011, down about 25 percent since the all-time high in 1990. Since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, about 53 million legal induced abortions were performed through 2011. What the Supreme Court decides Monday could ripple across other states and in Washington. The court has not ruled substantively on the abortion issue since 1992, when the justices said any such law could not place an \"undue burden\" on women's access to abortions. The swing vote, as in previous cases, came from Kennedy. It appears inevitable his vote will again prove crucial in the Texas dispute. This appeal could effectively be set aside as a political and legal issue in 2016 if the high court is unable to muster a binding majority. By next spring, a new president, and possibly a new member of the high court would then reset the abortion debate in a post-Scalia era.",

            "article_content": "Fox News media analyst explains Donald Trump had his strongest debate performance here in Las Vegas, and Hillary Clinton had to deal with probing questions about Wikileaks disclosures, late-term abortion and open borders. In the end they were evenly matched, an outcome that favors Trump as the less experienced debater. But the 90 minutes moderated by Chris Wallace did little to change the dynamic of a race in which the Republican nominee is trailing. Instead, in an unusually substantive and largely civil encounter, the candidates played to their respective bases on such issues as immigration and abortion. So while Trump supporters have reason to cheer their man, who was far more sure-footed than in their first faceoff on Long Island, he did not shake up the race. But Trump may have undone whatever progress he made with a single answer, refusing to say he would accept the results of an election he has increasingly described as rigged. \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe media is so dishonest and so corrupt\u201d that it has \u201cpoisoned the minds of voters.\u201d Clinton called that answer \u201chorrifying\u201d and said Trump often blames a loss on a rigged system, even when his \u201cApprentice\u201d show didn\u2019t win an Emmy three years in a row. That will undoubtedly be the big headline coming out of the debate and will dog Trump between now and Election Day. Trump\u2019s shakiest moment came when he was asked about the allegations of sexual misconduct by nine women. He said their stories were \u201clargely debunked,\u201d that they want their \u201c10 minutes of fame\u201d and said, without evidence, that he believed the Clinton campaign was behind it. Clinton countered by saying Trump had denied the allegations by suggesting the women weren\u2019t attractive, adding: \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\u201d The Democratic nominee stumbled when asked about conflicts at the Clinton Foundation. When Clinton responded by praising the charity\u2019s work, Wallace cut her off and tossed the question of Trump, who called it a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d After two weeks of immersion in allegations of bias, misbehavior and a rigged election, the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor brought the focus back to serious issues\u2014and was tough on both contenders. Some of the sharpest exchanges took place on immigration. Trump made his usual push for strong borders against \u201cbad hombres\u201d; Clinton said massive deportations would \u201crip our country apart\u201d and accused her opponent of having \u201cchoked\u201d by not bringing up his proposed wall during his meeting with Mexico\u2019s president. She also accused him of bashing immigrants. When Wallace asked Clinton about a Wikileaks disclosure that she had favored \u201copen borders\u201d in a six-figure speech to a big bank, she deflected the question and blamed Russian espionage for trying to influence the election. \u201cThat was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders,\u201d Trump said. She shot back by saying that Vladimir Putin wanted a \u201cpuppet\u201d as president, prompting Trump to say they had never met and were hardly best friends. An opening question on the Supreme Court produced a study in contrasts: Clinton talked about the court defending women\u2019s, gay and abortion rights. Trump hit Ruth Bader Ginsburg and said the Second Amendment is under siege. Prodded repeatedly by Wallace, Trump would not say he wanted the high court to overturn Roe v. Wade but said that would be the outcome since he will appoint pro-life justices. Clinton, of course, said she strongly supports the decision, noted Trump\u2019s criticism of Planned Parenthood and recalled his walked-back remark about punishing women who had abortions if the procedure is outlawed. Pressed by Wallace on why she voted against banning partial-birth abortion, Clinton said the government should not step in in making that \u201cmost personal of decisions.\u201d Trump spoke of the gruesome nature of the procedure. Wallace, who fought to enforce time limits, was also tough on Trump, saying that when it came to his financial plans, \u201ceven conservative economics\u201d say \u201cthe numbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t address that point but attacked NAFTA, pushed through by Bill Clinton, and accused his opponent of flip-flopping on the Pacific trade deal. \u201cThere\u2019s only one candidate on this stage who has shipped jobs to Mexico,\u201d she countered. It is harder for a trailing candidate to shake up the race in a third debate, as impressions harden after the first two. Trump, who owns a major casino in this city, did not win enough chips to change the betting odds. And he continued to question whether the house rules are fair.",

            "article_content": "William la Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the REAL ID Act to prevent foreign nationals from fraudulently obtaining a U.S. driver's license -- by requiring that any ID issued based on unverifiable foreign documents look different in \"design or color\" from an official driver's license. That way, TSA and other law enforcement would know the ID holder might not be who they say they are. But more than a decade later, several state and local governments are openly flouting the law, issuing ID cards that are barely distinguishable from a bona fide driver's license. That means those with mere ID cards, like illegal immigrants, might be able to pass off their cards as a driver's license at the airport and elsewhere -- creating a huge gap in security. Examples include Washington, D.C., and Colorado. For card-holders in the nation's capital, a small star in the corner is the only visual cue that distinguishes a D.C. license from a mere ID card. In Colorado, the distinguishing characteristic for the ID cards is a small black band. \"If you could issue a letter grade to the way states are handling this, it would be an 'F',\" said Andrew Meehan, of the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License. From the outset, states have chafed at the new federal rules. They called the policy an unfunded mandate and federal intrusion. More recently, advocates for illegal immigrants have opposed the parts of the law that require \"noncompliant\" cards for undocumented workers to look different than licenses for U.S. citizens and legal residents. \"What we object to is states that gratuitously would try to do much more than necessary for the sole purpose of stigmatizing individuals,\" said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Jon Blazer. \"On the other hand, some states have taken a better approach in this regard, and have put the minimal requirements that they're obliged to put under federal law.\" Meehan said 23 states currently meet Department of Homeland Security standards. However, six of those states issue ID cards that look virtually identical to a standard driver's license, violating the act's language. Since January alone, one of those states -- California -- has issued licenses to 500,000 illegal immigrants. \"In California they are accepting hundreds of documents issued by foreign governments,\" Meehan said. \"They are very difficult to verify.\" Other than the words, \"federal limits apply,\" the California license and ID are identical. Compare those to Illinois, which uses different colors in the two sets of IDs, and Utah, which uses a different design entirely. North Carolina proposed using a bright pink banner to distinguish a license from one issued to illegal immigrant children given lawful status, but it backed down. \"North Carolina proposed to put a hot pink color on the licenses of young immigrants sometimes known as 'dreamers' and one could not really understand any legitimate reason for doing that other than to stigmatize and give them a scarlet letter,\" Blazer complained. In passing Real ID, Congress said the law was about security, not about stigmas. Indeed, three 9/11 hijackers had obtained state IDs using fraudulent documents. One had four IDs from two states. Among them, the 33 hijackers had 33 state driver's licenses. The law is meant to set the standards for states issuing licenses, and the types of acceptable source documents. If unverifiable documents are used, that's when the ID cards are supposed to look different from regular licenses. Meehan says states do not have the resources to verify the accuracy of source documents from foreign countries. Blazer, though, says they do. Typically, states accept one of three forms of ID from Mexico: A passport, a Mexican elections card or a Matricula Consular card, which reports show can be obtained without a verifiable source document. Verification problems have fueled changes at the state level. In 2011, Utah issued 'Marcelo Marquez' a state driver's privilege card. At the time, getting the card required multiple identifying documents, but no fingerprints or photo. It turned out the source documents were fakes. Marquez was really Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, deported twice for violent crimes and drug dealing. Bracamonte used the Utah ID to get around the country until last year, when he killed two California deputies after a car chase. Utah now requires fingerprints for non-residents and changed the look of its ID cards to distinguish them from a license.",

Joe Carr could be the next Dave Brat. Like Brat, the upstart who overcame massive funding and name-recognition disadvantages to knock off sitting House majority leader Eric Cantor, Carr is running in an open primary against a moderate Republican who has long angered conservative activists. And like it was for Brat in June, immigration has been a hot topic on the trail and drawn national support to his cause. But unlike Brat, Carr\u2019s opponent, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., saw him coming. [Polls close in Tennessee at 8 p.m. ET. You can track the results with the Tennessee Secretary of State and watch Fox for coverage of tonight\u2019s key primary contests, online at FoxNews.com] Big turnout - There are early signs of a big turnout boost in the Volunteer State, where Alexander, a former governor, a former U.S. secretary of Education and onetime presidential candidate, is seeking a third term at the age of 74. Carr, a state senator from the conservative stronghold of Rutherford County south of Nashville, has been running long and hard but only recently caught the attention of national conservatives drawn to his emphasis on opposing the Alexander-backed immigration compromise legislation of 2013. Both Carr and\u00a0Alexander have been running full tilt and getting lots of media attention in what is the last realistic hope for GOP insurgents to unseat a sitting senator this cycle. Alexander has been highlighting his opposition to ObamaCare and touting his ties to the rebirth of Republicanism in the longtime Democratic bastion, while Carr has stayed hard after the immigration issue. [The Tennessean: \u201c[State Rep. Joe Carr] added that the record turnout in early voting, during which more than 550,000 ballots were cast, could be an encouraging sign. \u2018We think that\u2019s because we have a very competitive ballot at the top,\u2019 he said.\u201d]Flinn is still in and that\u2019s trouble for Alexander in Memphis - Memphis doctor and regional media mogul George Shea Flinn has spent about $1 million on his long-shot Senate bid and continued a low-intensity but steady campaign schedule. Flinn, who owns seven radio stations and three television stations in the state, has persisted in the race despite meagre showings in pre-primary polls. But if Carr catches fire, Flinn could play a significant role. Flinn\u2019s presence will cost incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander votes among more moderate Republicans in Memphis and the rest of Shelby County. Metro Memphis is a Democratic stronghold and has a low concentration of Republicans, but Shelby County is the largest, by far, of any county in the state and will deliver the biggest cache of votes today \u2013 perhaps 100,000 of 800,000 cast. If Flinn gets some favorite-son status there, Alexander may have to make up the difference among more conservative voters elsewhere in the state. [Flinn\u2019s Memphis radio station WHBQ-AM 560 was the first in the world to play an Elvis Presley song.]A Tennessee titan who doesn\u2019t score well - The Tennessean: \u201cIf Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander [wins] it will be in spite of the unkind comments some leading conservative groups make about his Senate voting record. Typical of them is American Conservative Union\u2026 Alexander\u2019s scores hit a low point with the group in 2013 when he earned a 60 percent rating. He tied [Republican] Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi for the lowest score among Republican senators facing a primary challenge in 2014\u2026 His lifetime ACU score has gone from 89 percent a decade ago to 76 percent\u2026 Some prominent conservative groups give Alexander even worse scores than ACU. Heritage Action, an arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, gives Alexander a 49 percent score for the 113th Congress.\u201dCOUNTIES TO WATCH Rutherford -\u00a0 Carr needs a blowout here in his home county \u2013 perhaps 80 percent of the vote \u2013 if he expects to stave off Alexander\u2019s expected strength in the more moderate Davidson County, home to Nashville.Knox County - The home to the University of Tennessee, this is where Alexander can put the race away. While suburbanites and rural residents in the western part of the sprawling county tend to be very conservative, the more populous eastern portion is a haven for moderate Republicanism, exactly Alexander\u2019s brand.Hamilton County - Neither candidate can claim a base in Chattanooga. Alexander\u2019s colleague Sen. Bob Corker is the former mayor and has pitched in for his senior senator there, but voters also tend to be quite conservative in this mountainous region. A key battleground in the race.DOWN BALLOT DRAMAIf turnout is unusually high, it won\u2019t just be because of the Senate stakes. While Republican Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s re-election bid has been a snoozer, two other contests have been intense. One involves a deeply embattled incumbent House member whose sweeping rural district also happens to be in the heart of the battleground in the Senate race.Scandal survivor? - National Journal: \u201c[Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn.] slept with his former patients, encouraged one to have an abortion, and twice urged his ex-wife to have an abortion. But oddly enough, when it came time for the Tennessee congressman to run for re-election, the \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement that had the most reason to despise him has instead given him close to a free pass\u2026 Once considered a long-shot, DesJarlais is now seen by some local political strategists as an even bet to win his Thursday primary against state Sen.

More]-- 89\u00a0days until\u00a0 Nov. 4 --OBAMA DUCKS ON MASS AMNESTY PLAN President Obama, at a pre-vacationpress conference, left open the possibility of issuing millions of work visas for illegal immigrants. Obama ducked a question about the controversial plan, but said that he would \u201cscour over\u201d laws and regulations to see what authority he has to address the \u201cunder-resourced\u201d immigration system. But the proposal would cross over from the selective enforcement that has allowed Obama to grant an indefinite amnesty to some 500,000 immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as minors. While Obama\u2019s decision caused plenty of outrage on the right, the administration has been able to claim that Obama is simply prioritizing enforcement in the face of insufficient resources. But granting visas to those previously deemed ineligible would not be shifting resources, it would be expending resources in pursuit of a policy goal. It\u2019s a move that would please his political base but also cause widespread anxiety about Obama\u2019s increasing tendency toward regency. Obama is expected to roll out his immigration plan after Labor Day.IRS extends scandal soaked tax program for illegals - Daily Caller: \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) quietly changed regulations to allow more undocumented immigrants to keep their taxpayer status through a program that is rife with fraud and abuse, and to delay deactivation of immigrant taxpayer status until 2016. The IRS now prevents peoples\u2019 Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from automatically expiring after five years as previously mandated. Now immigrants can keep their ITIN so long as they pay taxes at least once in a five-year period\u2026 Reports came out during the IRS scandal linking ITIN fraud to billions in lost taxpayer dollars. The IRS was forced to reform the ITIN program at the start of 2013 \u2013 but this new regulation undoes that reform.\u201d [George Will examines former president Richard Nixon\u2019s long shadow in light of the IRS scandal.]\u2018It\u2019s the law of the land,\u2019 except when it isn\u2019t - Fox News: \u201cA new congressional report has estimated that more than 25 million Americans without health insurance will not be made to pay a penalty in 2016 due to an exploding number of ObamaCare exemptions.\u201d On the list of ObamaCare fine exemptions: Illegal immigrants, members of certain Native American tribes or religious sects, victims of domestic violence, those who have suffered property damage suffered in a fire or flood, having a health plan canceled when ObamaCare came into effect or experiencing \u201canother hardship acquiring health insurance.\u201d [The Judge\u2019s Ruling - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explores the admission by CIA Director John Brennan that the agency spied on the Senate and where that admission might lead. \u201cThis may very well be a smoking gun in the now substantial case against President Barack Obama\u2026\u201d]Dems on the record with impeachment 20 times more than GOP - The Hill: \u201cCongressional Democrats have talked about the impeachment of President Obama 20 times more than Republicans have on the House and Senate floors.

He\u2019s going to take [his message] to where people vote.\u201d To be sure, Trump over roughly the past two weeks has increased his efforts to appeal to black voters, arguing that the policies of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and those of other Democratic lawmakers have failed residents in many U.S. cities, particularly African-Americans. \u201cHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities,\u201d Trump said at an Aug. 17 rally in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers \u201chave ruined the schools. They\u2019ve driven out the jobs. They\u2019ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable. \u2026 I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\u201d However, critics argued that Trump made the speech 40 miles away from Milwaukee and that other, similar speeches have been held in such places as Austin, Texas, and Des Moines, Iowa -- not areas that Trump has highlighted, like Chicago\u2019s South Side or west Baltimore. \u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d Conway said Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m new to the post. I will take his case to everyone.\u201d Conway also attempted to clarify Trump\u2019s immigration policy, which at the start of his campaign included plans to build a wall, paid for by Mexico, along the entire southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and have a deportation \"force\u201d to remove the estimated 11 people now living in the country illegally. Conway said Trump wants to find \u201cthe fair and humane way necessary to enforce the law\u201d and that he\u2019s no longer talking about a deportation force. She also said the argument about Trump softening his illegal immigration stances should be considered \u201cmore about approach than policy\u201d but also tried to make clear that he does not support amnesty or the legalization of illegal immigrants. \u201cEverything has to be looked at,\u201d Conway said. She also sought to further define Trump\u2019s stances by comparing them to Clinton\u2019s, which she said includes amnesty, law enforcement\u2019s \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d of \u00a0illegal immigrants and plans to further President Obama\u2019s use of executive powers to change federal immigration law.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee suggests the presidential election is being rigged Donald Trump would not commit Wednesday night to accepting the results of the presidential election if he loses on Nov. 8, in a striking moment during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that underscored the deepening tensions in the race \u2013 as the bitter rivals defined the choice for voters on an array of issues not three weeks from Election Day. The debate in Las Vegas, moderated by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, started with a measured discussion on policy disputes ranging from gun rights to abortion to immigration. But it ended with the candidates hurling a grab-bag of accusations and insults at each other. Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman.\u201d Clinton called Trump the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d person to run for president in modern history. The most pointed moment came when Trump \u2013 who for weeks has warned of a \u201crigged\u201d election \u2013 was asked whether he will commit to accept the results of the election. \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d Trump said, citing his concerns about voter registration fraud, a \u201ccorrupt media\u201d and an opponent he claimed \u201cshouldn\u2019t be allowed to run\u201d because she committed a \u201cvery serious crime\u201d with her emails. Pressed again whether he\u2019s prepared to concede if he loses, Trump again said: \u201cI will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d Clinton delivered a sharp rejoinder: \u201cThat\u2019s horrifying.\u201d \u201cThat is not the way our democracy works,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is denigrating, he\u2019s talking down our democracy and I for one am appalled.\u201d Trump responded by calling the Justice Department\u2019s handling of her email probe \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d The exchange was among many contentious moments at Wednesday\u2019s debate, which covered several issues including the national debt that have gotten little attention in the race so far \u2013 but flared with arguments between the candidates over WikiLeaks, over Russia, over the Clinton Foundation and over women\u2019s allegations of groping against Trump. Through the thicket of accusations and personal animus \u2013 they never shook hands on stage \u2013 the candidates tried generally to mount a closing debate-stage argument about experience. \u201cFor 30 years, you\u2019ve been in a position to help. \u2026 The problem is you talk, but you don\u2019t get anything done, Hillary,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you become president, this country is going to be in some mess, believe me.\u201d Clinton countered by contrasting some of her experiences against Trump\u2019s. She said when she was monitoring the Usama bin Laden raid in the Situation Room, \u201cHe was hosting \u2018The Celebrity Apprentice.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019m happy to compare my 30 years of experience \u2026 with your 30 years, and I will let the American people make that decision,\u201d Clinton said. Trump, meanwhile, again disputed the multiple allegations of groping that women have leveled against him since the candidates\u2019 last encounter. He also said he thinks the Clinton campaign is behind the claims, charging, \u201cThey either want fame or her campaign did it.\u201d Clinton said, \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\u201d Trump repeated that \u201cnobody has more respect for women\u201d than him. Trump then shifted to blast the Clinton Foundation as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d He pointed to donations from countries like Saudi Arabia to question Clinton\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s rights. He asked her if she would return money from countries that treat certain \u201cgroups of people horribly,\u201d which she did not answer directly. The candidates\u2019 third and final debate now sets a bitter tone for the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 a race that already stands out as arguably the most personal, caustic and unpredictable White House battle in modern politics. Trump, slipping in the polls amid various campaign controversies, said at the last debate that Clinton should be in jail. Clinton has blasted Trump all along as temperamentally unfit for office. Since the second debate, numerous women have come forward to accuse Trump of groping them, allegations he denies. WikiLeaks also has embarrassed the Clinton campaign by releasing thousands of hacked emails purportedly from her campaign chairman\u2019s account. FBI files alleging a State Department official sought a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to alter the classification on a Clinton server email added to the campaign\u2019s \u2013 and Obama administration\u2019s \u2013 woes. The WikiLeaks controversy came up Wednesday night when Clinton asked if Trump would \u201ccondemn\u201d Russian espionage. He denied knowing Vladimir Putin but said the issue is the Russian president has \u201cno respect\u201d for her. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet,\u201d Clinton shot back. Trump responded, \u201cNope. \u2026 you\u2019re the puppet.\u201d Trump later said he condemns any interference by Russia in the election. The candidates also sparred over gun rights, with the Republican nominee charging that the Second Amendment is \u201cunder absolute siege\u201d and would be eroded if his opponent wins. \u201cWe will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what we have now\u201d if Clinton wins, Trump said. The Democratic nominee countered, \u201cI support the Second Amendment.\u201d In a graphic exchange, Trump said Clinton\u2019s position on abortion is nearing a point where one could \u201crip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month.\u201d Clinton accused him of \u201cscare rhetoric.\u201d They also clashed on immigration, with Trump saying they need to deport \u201cdrug lords\u201d and deal with \u201cbad hombres\u201d in the country. Clinton said violent offenders should be deported but then mocked Trump for not pushing his controversial border wall proposal during his high-profile meeting with the Mexican president. \u201cHe choked,\u201d she said. Trump said Clinton \u201cwanted a wall\u201d when she voted for an immigration overhaul a decade ago \u2013 and now wants \u201copen borders,\u201d which she denied. To date, the mounting controversies facing both campaigns have appeared to hurt Trump more than Clinton, who gradually has expanded her lead over the GOP nominee in recent polls. A Fox News national poll released on the eve of the Las Vegas debate showed Clinton with a 6-point, 45-39 percent lead over Trump in a match-up that includes Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump, in the final three weeks, is thought to be zeroing in on several key battlegrounds including Florida, Ohio and North Carolina \u2013 but the polls suggest his path to the presidency remains narrow, as even once-reliably red states like Texas are being contested by the Clinton campaign.",

The Canadian-born American citizen, and Republican presidential candidate, was the butt of two north-of-the-border jabs this week. Ahead of Tuesday's 2016 debate, the Democratic Party\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted it was so excited it forgot to wish Cruz a happy Canadian Thanksgiving. Then on Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest invoked Cruz again as he celebrated his hometown Kansas City Royals reaching the American League Championship Series where they will face the Toronto Blue Jays. \u201cI certainly was pleased to see the Royals advance by defeating the Houston Astros last night, and they're ready to take on Ted Cruz\u2019s other hometown team, the Toronto Blue Jays, next,\u201d Earnest said to laughter from the press corps. The Texas senator and 2016 presidential hopeful was born in Calgary -- not Toronto -- in 1970, while his parents were working in the oil business. The remarks may be in jest, but with Cruz polling in the middle of the GOP primary pack, and one of the Republicans leading the race for campaign donations, it's possible the Democrats are trying to lay the foundation for a more serious attack. \"I think this is just sort of like, 'Don't worry we're going to raise this if you become the nominee we're going to make an issue of this' even though the history and the precedent of the Naturalization Act of 1790 makes it pretty clear that this would be perfectly OK,\" columnist Liz Peek told FoxNews.com LIVE. \"So I don't think it's totally a jest.\" Ted Cruz's campaign declined to comment.

            "article_content": "Francisco Javier Chavez, (l.), posted bail and has not been seen again after allegedly beating a toddler. Jose Enrique Vasquez, (r.), was accused of killing a child, but could be freed if he posts bail. When Francisco Javier Chavez posted bail on charges of beating a California toddler within an inch of her life in late July, there was little reason to expect the illegal immigrant, who has spent much of his adult life hopping back and forth across the Mexican border, would return to face justice. Two weeks later, at his scheduled arraignment on Aug. 13, Chavez was a no-show. The 27-year-old career criminal had put up $10,000, or 10 percent of the amount set for his alleged crimes by California's bail schedule. His disappearance is hardly a surprise to critics who believe violent illegal immigrants are, by definition, flight risks who should be denied bail in such serious cases. They say judges, especially in border states plagued by illegal immigrant crime, are naive or worse if they expect suspects who regularly cross in and out of Mexico to take the U.S. justice system seriously. \u201cFrankly, judges grant bail in cases like these because they are being foolish,\u201d said Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department lawyer now at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. \u201cThe judge can consider bail for you when you are charged with a crime, but does not have to let you out on bail. If the state can show you are a flight risk, you should not get bail. If the state can show you are a danger to the public because of a history of violence, you should not get bail.\u201d \u201cFrankly, judges grant bail in cases like these because they are being foolish.\u201d While Chavez is in the wind, his alleged victim, the 2-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend, is now in foster care, paralyzed from the beating that also left her with both arms and a femur broken. Well before he was arrested in San Luis Obispo County for attacking the child, Chavez had compiled a lengthy criminal record that includes assault and drug convictions and arrests for violent acts such as kidnapping, car-jacking and cruelty to a child. He was deported in February 2014, but as in previous instances, found it easy to sneak back across the border and into the U.S. Weeks after Chavez slipped out of custody, on Sept. 1, another 2-year-old toddler named Jonathan Montez was run down and killed in San Bernardino County. Illegal immigrant Jose Enrique Vasquez, 53, an unlicensed driver who witnesses said was speeding down the child\u2019s residential street, fled the scene, according to authorities. He was arrested two weeks later, and, like Chavez, was granted bail. Vasquez also has compiled a lengthy criminal record under various aliases, including charges of spousal abuse, battery of a peace officer, driving without a license, driving under the influence and armed robbery. But other charges in his criminal record might have given a judge pause in considering bail according to critics, including failure to appear in court, possession of false citizenship documents and eight deportations for illegally entering the country. Jonathan Montez was just 2 when he was run down and killed in San Bernardino County. An illegal immigrant was charged in his death. The systems for granting bail in state courts varies from state to state. California's bail system lays out prescribed amounts for various crimes as a guideline for law enforcement and judges, but judges retain discretion to raise the amount in cases where the suspect is a flight risk or a danger to the public and the district attorney can add, drop or change the charges. Two states, Alabama and Missouri, have passed laws that preclude bail for illegal immigrants suspected of serious crimes, while judges in other states -- notably Texas -- weigh illegal status in making their decisions. But last year, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Arizona's 2006 law banning bail for illegal immigrant suspects violated their right to due process and amounted to punishment before trial. The 11-member panel's decision called the law a \"scattered attempt\" to deal with the problem of chronic bail-skipping by illegal immigrants. Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the lower court's decision. Judges everywhere maintain discretion to deny bail to anyone they believe is likely to flee justice, yet they often fail to consider illegal status as a factor, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. And critics say it should be obvious that someone here illegally and suspected of a violent crime will bolt rather than face justice, especially in border states such as California, where they can be out of the country an hour after posting bail. \u201cAliens who commit acts of violence should not be released on bail, because they are clearly a danger to the public, and when we have someone with this kind of deportation history, clearly they are an obvious flight risk,\u201d said von Spakovsky. \u201cThese judges are making mistakes granting bail to illegal aliens \u2013 reckless mistakes that endangered the public.\u201d The willingness of judges to grant bail to illegal immigrants charged with serious crimes compounds the ongoing controversy involving so-called sanctuary cities. Such jurisdictions, either by local statute or practice, refuse to inform federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents when an illegal immigrant is detained. But even jurisdictions that do not implement sanctuary policies believe that two federal court rulings, the 2013 California \u201cTrust Act,\u201d which limits \u201ccruel and costly immigration hold requests in local jails,\u201d and an ambiguous White House policy all bar them from holding illegal immigrants who have posted bail until federal authorities can collect and deport them \u2013 even if ICE asks them to via what is known as a \u201cdetainer request.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union has sued jurisdictions that attempted to honor the ICE detainers, and the Department of Justice has not intervened in the cases to underscore its support of them. As a result, local law enforcement agencies say they have no choice but to let even violent illegal immigrant suspects walk once they are granted bail. \u201cYes, the judges who ignore this risk are at fault, but Congress provided ICE with a tool to address the problem -- detainers -- which the Obama administration is not allowing its officers to use,\u201d Vaughan said. In the cases of both Chavez and Vasquez, ICE issued detainer requests. In Chavez\u2019s case, ICE agents did not arrive prior to bail being posted. In the case of Vasquez, ICE isn\u2019t immediately taking custody or deporting Vasquez, so that he remains in the U.S. at least resolving the legal proceedings surrounding the hit-and-run charge. Don Rosenberg, who, after his 25-year-old son Drew was killed by an unlicensed immigrant driver in San Francisco five years ago, began closely tracking illegal immigrant crime, said the biggest problem he sees is \u201cpeople in power don\u2019t care.\u201d He blames judges for granting bail, but also holds law enforcement accountable for caving in to the threat of lawsuits. \u201cHow can anyone who in law enforcement let people like this out of custody who we know will likely hurt someone badly, if not kill them, even if they are threatened with a lawsuit?\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure callous indifference. I don\u2019t know how they live with themselves.\u201d",

The marijuana was found in an old tractor-trailer that entered the Otay Mesa cargo facility about 9:40 a.m. Thursday, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. Customs officers ran the truck through an imaging system and then opened boxes stacked inside containing 587 wrapped packages of marijuana, according to the paper. The truck and trailer were seized and the 47-year-old Mexican driver was turned over to agents with the Department of Homeland Security. The driver attempted to enter the country from Tijuana, Mexico, declaring that he was carrying furniture. Border agents at border crossing cargo facilities in Southern California have seized bigger shipments of marijuana. The record was set in 2013 when 17 tons of marijuana were confiscated and nearly broken in 2015 when 16 tons were confiscated, the Union-Tribune reported.

(AP Photo/John Locher) (The Associated Press) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listen during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) (The Associated Press) Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, right, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump listen to a question during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) (The Associated Press) ST. LOUIS \u2013 The Latest on the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (all times EDT): 10:50 p.m. Maybe it was the compliments they'd just given each other. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shook hands after the debate ended, something they refused to do 90 minutes earlier. The debate was especially icy at the outset, replete with talk of sexual impropriety and Trump threatening to jail Clinton over her erased emails. But the St. Louis rumble concluded with a voter asking them to say something nice about each other. Clinton's and Trump's families quickly joined them on stage as the debate wrapped up. The candidates greeted their relatives and then circulated the room, which is filled with undecided Missouri voters as well as supporters of the two campaigns. ___ 10:45 p.m. After 90 minutes of disagreeing, sometimes harshly, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are ending their second presidential debate on a positive note. They were asked by a town hall attendee to say something they admire about the other. Clinton says she respects Trump's children, a comment Trump calls \"a very nice compliment.\" He says he sees Clinton as a \"fighter\" even though he disagrees with much of what she's fighting for. He says \"she does fight hard and doesn't give up and I consider that a very good trait.\" ___ 10:40 p.m. Donald Trump says the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama has hurt domestic energy production with overreaching restrictions. Trump says: \"Energy is under siege, under absolute siege. The EPA is killing these energy companies.\" Trump blames Obama, and by association Clinton, for coal mines closing. He first noted West Virginia, a state that typically votes Republican, before adding two key coal states \u2014 Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 he probably needs to capture to win the White House. Trump is also lamenting Chinese companies selling cheaper steel on the international market, hurting the U.S. steel industry. Clinton agrees that China is dumping cheap steel on the market, but notes that \"Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings.\" ___ 10:36 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are laying out their criteria for Supreme Court selections. Clinton said she wants justices who understand how the world \"really works.\" She wants ones who will support the legality of abortion and same-sex marriage. She notes that several of the justices Trump has said he'd consider oppose those rights. Trump says he wants a judge in the tradition of Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia's death this winter opened a vacancy on the court that still has not been filled. The Republican-controlled Senate has refused to consider President Obama's nominee to fill Scalia's seat. ___ 10:34 p.m. Donald Trump is denying encouraging people to check out a sex tape of a former Miss Universe \u2014 something he recently did on Twitter. Referencing the controversy over former beauty queen Alicia Machado, Trump said his past comments, \"It wasn't, 'Check out a sex tape.'\" Instead, Trump claims he just asked people to \"take a look at the past of this of this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\" But Trump did encourage his Twitter followers to \"check out sex tape and past\" of Machado. He also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton helped Machado become a U.S. citizen to vote against Trump. Clinton had criticized Trump for slamming Machado for gaining weight after becoming Miss Universe. ___ 10:32 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton has \"tremendous hate in her heart.\" Trump made the comment in reference to Clinton saying earlier in the campaign that half of Trump's supporters are \"deplorables.\" Clinton apologized for saying that half of his supporters were deplorables, but didn't back down from using that word. After Trump said Sunday that Clinton had \"tremendous hate in her heart,\" she laughed and shook her head. But she did not address the comment the next time she spoke. ___ 10:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton is flipping a question about her comments that half of Donald Trump's supporters fit into a \"basket of deplorables\" into a criticism of Trump's campaign. She says her problem is with Trump, not his supporters. She is accusing Trump of inciting violence and running a campaign based on insults. Clinton says she apologized for her remarks within hours. In a statement, she said she regretted saying \"half\" but did not retract the comments. ___ 10:28 p.m. Hillary Clinton is asserting that \"bullying is up\" among young people because of what she calls \"the Trump effect.\" Clinton says there is \"a lot of fear,\" ''people are feeling uneasy\" and \"a lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\" She is not citing any specific statistics to back up her assertions about a rise in bullying inspired by Trump's bombastic style. The candidates were asked if, as president, they would be devoted to all people in the U.S. Both candidates answered yes. Trump stressed he would be \"a president for all of our people\" \u2014 specifically mentioning African-Americans, Latinos and Hispanics while highlighting what he described as poor conditions in the big cities where many minorities live. He asserted \"education is a disaster\" and \"jobs are essentially non-existent\" in the inner cities. ___ 10:23 p.m. Donald Trump says he disagrees with his running mate Mike Pence on the proper strategy to deal with the civil war and humanitarian crisis in Syria. Debate moderator Martha Raddatz pointed out that Pence had said provocations by Russia in Syria need to be met with \"American strength\" and the U.S. should be prepared to use air strikes in Syria against the regime of President Bashar Assad. But Trump says he disagrees with Pence, a former member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and notes they had not spoken about the issue. Trump says the U.S. focus should be on eliminating the Islamic State, and not getting entangled with fights with Assad and Russia. \"We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved,\" Trump says. ___ 10:22 p.m. Hillary Clinton is pledging not to use American ground forces in Syria, saying it would be a \"very serious mistake.\" Clinton says she doesn't think American troops should be holding territory as an occupying force, saying it's not a \"smart strategy.\" Asked how she would fight the Islamic State in a different way than President Barack Obama, Clinton says she's hopeful that IS will be pushed out of Iraq by the time she's president. But she says she would specifically target IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and consider arming Kurdish fighters in Iraq. ___ 10:20 p.m. Donald Trump is blaming Hillary Clinton for what was called the \"red line\" in Syria, a generalization about the U.S. response to Bashar Assad's regime. But Clinton didn't make the claim. President Barack Obama did. And he did it after Clinton had left the administration as secretary of state. Trump says, \"She's there with the line-in-the-sand.\" Clinton pipes in: \"No, I wasn't. I was gone.\" Trump responds: \"But you were in contact, excuse me. Sadly, perhaps President Obama was still listening to you.\" The exchange was about the city of Aleppo in Syria, where the Assad regime, backed by Russia, is fighting to root out rebels and killing civilians in the process. ___ 10:18 p.m. Donald Trump disagrees with his running mate over Syria. Trump says there's no point in trying to prevent civilian deaths in Aleppo. Syria's most populous city is under intense bombardment by Russian forces. The U.S. government has warned Russia that it's killing civilians rather than terrorists. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, said last week the U.S. should use military force if Russia keeps attacking civilians in Syria. Trump says he disagrees with Pence. Trump says he's no fan of Russia or Syrian President Bashar Assad. But he says the two of them are fighting Islamic State militants, as is Iran. Despite repeated prodding by moderator Martha Raddatz, Trump did not say he'd try to check Russian actions. Hillary Clinton says she'd try to rein in Russia. She contends that Russia is trying to get Trump elected president. ___ 10:15 p.m. Hillary Clinton is listing her accomplishments during three decades as an elected official \u2014 amid a series of interruptions by Donald Trump. When Trump pressed Clinton on why she hadn't changed tax policies that benefit the wealthy, like him, after so many years in office, Clinton said she opposed such policies \"but that's not the point.\" Trump shot back, \"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.\" Clinton blamed President George W. Bush for thwarting her in the area. Clinton then added that, as senator, she helped \"rebuild\" New York after the Sept. 11 attacks, while getting proper health care for first responders sickened during clean up. She says that, as secretary of state, she advocated for global women's rights and reduced nuclear weapons with Russia. ___ 10:12 p.m. Donald Trump is repeatedly interrupting Clinton, while she is largely avoiding barging in as he speaks. The moderators have noticed. As Clinton tried to address why she didn't try to change tax laws when she was a New York senator, Trump tried to butt in. \"Please allow her to respond,\" said CNN's Anderson Cooper said. \"She didn't interrupt you.\" Clinton continued. A few moments later, when the two were addressing foreign policy, Clinton sniped to Trump, \"I didn't want to interrupt you, but at some point we need to do some fact checking here.\" ___ 10:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is promising that no one making less than $250,000 will pay higher taxes under her plan, but those with higher incomes could pay considerably more. Clinton says she wants to impose a special tax on people making over $1 million and a surcharge on those with incomes above $5 million. \"We have to make up for lost times,\" Clinton says, telling the audience she wants to raise taxes on the rich \"because I want to invest in you.\" She says Trump's proposed tax plan would end up raising taxes on millions of middle-class Americans. ___ 10:07 p.m. Donald Trump says he will get rid of the carried interest loophole that allows Wall Street traders to pay a lower tax rate on their earnings. Trump says he would eliminate the loophole that lets money managers count their earnings as capital gains, which carry a lower tax rate, instead of ordinary income. But Trump's carried interest provision doesn't actually raise taxes on hedge fund managers and it creates a new loophole that could provide them with an even lower rate. The Republican says he would cut taxes for the middle class and accuses Clinton of raising taxes on middle-class families. ___ 10:05 p.m. Hillary Clinton occasionally smiles, sometimes jots notes and frequently sits to listen as Donald Trump talks. Trump paces the room, forcefully points at Clinton when addressing her and keeps his lips pursed tight as she speaks. He's only used his chair to rest his hands on the back of it. The town hall-style format of this debate gives television viewers a look at how the presidential candidates carry themselves in stressful situations. There have been no shoulder shimmies. That Clinton move \u2014 prompted in the first debate when Trump said he had a better temperament than her \u2014 spawned a thousand GIFs. ___ 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is saying it's OK to have a public and private position on an issue because Abraham Lincoln did. She is responding to a question about an email released by a WikiLeaks last week in which Clinton said it's acceptable for a president to project differing positions. She was asked whether that's \"two-faced.\" She says Lincoln did whatever he could to get the 13th Amendment passed, allowing emancipation of the slaves, by lawmakers who did not support African-American equality. Clinton says: \"I was making the point it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want them to do. That was a great display of presidential leadership.\" Trump began his response to Clinton's statement by rolling his eyes, and says, \"Now she's blaming the late, great Abraham Lincoln.\" ___ 9:57 p.m. It's hard to name the most memorable line in this combative debate. But the most memorable visual so far? That's easy. It's the image of Hillary Clinton answering a question, while Donald Trump looms behind her. Unrestricted by a podium, Clinton is using the whole stage at the town hall-style forum, crossing in front of Trump to answer audience questions. That's left Trump stuck in the camera shot behind her, standing awkwardly, at times swaying and pacing, while he listens to her answers. Trump often mocked Clinton for spending time preparing for the debate. It's not clear how much time he spent preparing for one of the trickiest elements \u2014 knowing where the camera is at all times. ___ 9:55 p.m. Donald Trump is again insisting he opposed the Iraq War before it started. But despite his repeated claims, the facts are clear: He did not. There is no evidence Trump expressed public opposition to the war before the U.S. invaded. Rather, he offered lukewarm support. The billionaire businessman only began to voice doubts about the conflict well after it began in March 2003. Trump's first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" he said. His first public comments strongly opposing the war came in 2004. Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, voted in favor of the invasion in 2002 while she was a New York senator. It's a vote she has said was a mistake. ___ 9:53 p.m. Donald Trump says a U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004 would still be alive if he had been president at the time. Trump is talking about Captain Humayun Khan, whose Pakistan-born father gave an impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. Trump then got into a feud with Khan's parents. Trump now says Captain Khan is an \"American hero\" and \"he would be alive today if I had been president.\" Trump's feud with the Khan family led to harsh criticism from veterans across the country and families of those killed in action. ___ 9:52 p.m. Donald Trump says the United States is allowing refugees from Syria and the Middle East to pour into America and \"we have no idea who they are\" or where exactly they are coming from. Asked about bans and strict limits on Muslim immigrants into the United States that he's supported in the past, Trump says it was a policy plan that would grow out of \"extreme vetting\" of people coming to the U.S. from global conflict areas. Trump calls allowing immigrants into the country without more scrutiny the \"Greatest Trojan Horse of all time\" and says it has to stop because \"we have enough problems in our country.\" ___ 9:51 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she'll screen Syrian refugees but the country needs to take in more. Clinton says a proposal like Donald Trump's to ban all Muslims from entering the country plays into the hands of terrorists. She also says Trump has alienated the country's Muslim allies. Clinton says \"we will have vetting and it will be as tough as it needs to be.\" But she is evoking the image of a bloodied 4-year-old Syrian boy to argue the United States needs to do its share. ___ 9:50 p.m. Donald Trump isn't answering a question about how to stop Islamophobia in America. Instead, he's saying American Muslims must report other Muslims who are engaging in dangerous behavior. He's repeating the false claim that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters saw bombs all over the floor in the shooters' home but did not report it. Clinton, meanwhile, is condemning \"dark and divisive\" things said about Muslims. She says the United States is not at war with Islam and says Muslims should feel welcome and included in society. ___ 9:45 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are clashing over the future of President Barack Obama's signature health care law. Clinton is vowing to fix the Affordable Care Act and Trump is promising to repeal and replace \"Obamacare.\" Clinton says 20 million more people have health coverage because of the law. She says she wants to \"save what works,\" but the next administration will need to get costs down and provide more help to small businesses. She says if the system is repealed it will be \"turned back\" to the insurance industry. Trump says the system is a \"disaster\" and \"will never work.\" He says it needs to be replaced with a less expensive system that's more flexible for patients regardless of what state they live in. ___ 9:40 p.m. Donald Trump is repeatedly interrupting Hillary Clinton and talking over the debate moderators. He also accuses the two moderators of siding with Clinton and refusing to let him answer questions. The interruptions prompted Clinton to exclaim, \"I know that you're into big diversions tonight.\" Trump seems sensitive to his interactions with Clinton. When the moderators asked a question and it was unclear whose turn it was to answer first, Clinton said, \"Go ahead, Donald.\" Trump replied, \"No, I'm a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead.\" Some in the audience laughed. ___ 9:38 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are clashing over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Clinton says she was \"very sorry\" for using the server, but she takes keeping classified information secret very seriously. She adds there's been no evidence her actions led to classified materials winding up in the wrong hands. Trump is accusing Clinton of lying, and says she improperly destroyed more than 30,000 emails that he says should have been turned over to law enforcement authorities. Trump says he was disappointed that Clinton had not been criminally charged. He tells Clinton, \"Again, you should be ashamed of yourself.\" He is also complaining that the two debate moderators are not sufficiently pressing Clinton on the email issue. ___ 9:35 p.m. Donald Trump is sniffling again. The Republican nominee is noticeably inhaling deeply through his nose in the early part of the debate. Trump's heavy inhalations became a hot topic in the previous debate, 13 days ago in Hempstead, New York. When asked about it the next morning, Trump denied he'd been sniffling. \"No, no sniffles,\" he said on \"Fox & Friends.\" ''No sniffles, no cold.\" ___ 9:33 p.m. Donald Trump is turning Hillary Clinton's demand for an apology back onto her, accusing her of stealing the Democratic nomination. Trump says Clinton unfairly won her party's nod by cheating rival Bernie Sanders. About Sanders, who eventually endorsed Clinton, Trump says, \"I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\" Trump went on to repeat debunked claims that Clinton started rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Trump has fomented the conspiracy for years \u2014 until last month, when he declared Obama, who was born in Hawaii, an American citizen. The long list of accusations was his response to Clinton's claim that Trump owes an apology to the many people and groups he has publicly quarreled with during his presidential campaign. ___ 9:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton is ignoring Donald Trump's statements about her husband's sexual past. Trump referenced Bill Clinton's 1998 impeachment, which followed an affair in the Oval Office and several other scenarios. Hillary Clinton responded by quoting Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention: \"When they go low, we go high.\" Hillary Clinton then said Trump owes the nation an apology for the way he's conducted his campaign. ___ 9:25 p.m. Donald Trump is raising accusations of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton, saying the former president \"was abusive to women\" and saying Hillary Clinton attacked the accusers \"viciously.\" Trump is also noting that Hillary Clinton was a court-appointed defender for a man accused of assaulting a 12-year-old who was raped in Arkansas and says she laughed at some point while discussing it. He also says Bill Clinton paid a monetary settlement to Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state worker who alleged in 1991 that Bill Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. Trump says video where he made crude comments to women \"it's just words, folks.\" He says Hillary Clinton's defense of her husband is \"disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself.\" ___ 9:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the Donald Trump heard on an 11-year-old recording making crude and vulgar remarks about women \"is who Donald Trump is.\" Clinton addressed Trump's predatory comments in the opening minutes of the second presidential debate Sunday. Clinton says the tape shows what Trump \"thinks about women, what he does to women.\" She says that while Trump has claimed the tape doesn't represent who he is, \"It's clear to anyone who heard it, it represents exactly who he is.\" Clinton says Trump has insulted not only women, but African-Americans, immigrants, people with disabilities, prisoners of war and others. ___ 9:15 p.m. Donald Trump denies he was discussing sexual assault in a 2005 recording that reveals him saying he can \"do anything\" with women because he is famous. He says he has never kissed or groped women without consent. And he's continuing to characterize the recording as \"locker room talk.\" Debate moderator Anderson Cooper put it more bluntly, saying, \"That is sexual assault.\" Trump responded: \"No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understand what I said.\" Trump continually tried to pivot to foreign policy, seemingly suggesting his comments pale in comparison to the actions of the Islamic State. ___ 9:12 p.m. Trump did not, at first use, the opening question about setting an example for children to apologize for the vulgar comments he made about women in 2005 that were taped and recently released. Instead he attempted to echo Clinton's remarks. \"I agree with everything that she said,\" Trump said. \"I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country, this is a great land.\" ___ 9:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says at the start of the second presidential debate that the campaign needs to set an example to children that our country great \"because we're good.\" Clinton was asked by a teacher if she thought the campaign was modeling \"appropriate and positive\" behavior. Clinton says the country needs to set big goals and work together to try to achieve them. She made no mention of Trump's vulgar comments in a 2005 tape that emerged Friday. ___ 9:05 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump refused to shake hands as they entered the debate hall in St. Louis. That's a break from traditional debate decorum. The town hall-style event is expected to be tense. Shortly before it began, Trump held a press conference with three women who had accused President Bill Clinton of sexual wrongdoing and Hillary Clinton of acting vindictively toward them. Trump also introduced a woman who as a 12-year-old had accused a man of rape; Hillary Clinton as a young lawyer defended that man. Those four women are seated with the Trump family in the front row of the audience of the debate hall. Bill Clinton shook hands with Trump's wife, Melania Trump, his two sons and daughter Ivanka as they entered the hall before the debate. ___ 8:50 p.m. The fireworks at the second presidential debate exploded even before the candidates took the stage. Donald Trump unexpectedly appeared live on his Facebook page with women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of rape and unwanted advances. They didn't take questions but repeated some of the claims they made against Clinton years ago. The women are expected to attend the debate as guests of Trump. Hillary Clinton's campaign responded by calling it a \"stunt\" that wouldn't alter Clinton's plans to speak directly to voters in the debate. The stunning moment raised further questions about how directly Trump plans to go after Bill Clinton in the debate. ___ 8:45 p.m. The second presidential debate is shaping up as potentially Donald Trump's final opportunity to keep his campaign from collapsing a month before Election Day. With prominent Republicans already abandoning him in droves, other Republicans, including leaders in Congress, are looking to the debate to see whether Trump shows enough contrition to stand by him despite his vulgar comments about women. There's been uncertainty about whether the Republican Party might shift resources away from his campaign in the final weeks or even try to replace him on the ticket. Another layer of unpredictability is the debate format. The candidates are taking questions from undecided voters and will be onstage with stools rather than traditional podiums.",

            "article_content": "Strategy Room: Jeanne Zaino and Brian Morgenstern discuss whether Trump can unify the Republicans Congress wasn\u2019t doing a lot before Donald Trump all but secured the Republican presidential nomination. And it\u2019s likely that Trump\u2019s fait accompli Tuesday could diminish congressional productivity even further. As lawmakers return to Washington after a week-long respite, Trump is already in a churning battle with House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and rank-and-file Republicans are divided over what to do about the top of the ticket. Moreover, lawmakers will convene in Washington for the first time with Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee. This is likely to spark four phenomena: Some Republican lawmakers who were reluctant to embrace Trump will rush to join the bandwagon. Secondly, some will dash the other direction to dodge Trump and build distance between their campaign and the New York businessman. Third, Democrats will stoke the political embers, painting Trump and Republicans together in the same camp. Fourth, political talk will dominate the Capitol. Reporters will pepper congressional GOPers about why they are or aren\u2019t backing Trump. Will there be a third party candidate? A savior emerging on a white horse? And you can bet someone will at least sprint to the post in some effort to court Ryan again despite his Sherman-esque statement a few weeks ago about not running for president. This is to say nothing of some Republicans who will blast Ryan for not publicly supporting Trump. Trump creates headaches for Ryan and other congressional leaders. The speaker always says he wants a competition of ideas. Well, how about the idea of building a wall along the Mexican border and forcing Mexico to pay for it? How about the idea that Trump wants to kick Muslims out of the country? How about Trump\u2019s position to cut off foreign workers? What about the idea Trump has to strip some native-born Americans of their citizenship? What about Trump\u2019s idea to deploy the military as a kind of domestic police force and come for families of those associated with terrorists? And what about Trump\u2019s idea to not touch Social Security (one of the key drivers of the national debt) yet hack all federal outlays in half in order to balance the budget in less than a decade? These are the reasons why Ryan can\u2019t get behind Trump just yet. On several occasions, Ryan has taken special care to disavow Trump\u2019s remarks related to everything from Muslims to white supremacy. But if Ryan wants the debate to be about ideas and Trump secured the nomination, well, it\u2019s pretty clear which ideas won out. Which idea is easier for the average voter to understand? Trump talking about rounding up Muslims or building walls \u2026 , or Ryan\u2019s preference of wonky, Oxford-style debate on tax inversions? For Republicans, that ship has sailed and perhaps already sinking, some suggest. What is unclear is what Congress may try to tackle in the coming months. Perhaps an even better question is what appetite Congress has to address much of anything in the near-term with Trump apparently on the ballot. The first issue is time. Congress is back for just a few weeks and then heads out for Memorial Day. Back a few more weeks then gone for July 4th. Then, two weeks in session before both the House and Senate depart on a staggering, nearly-eight week furlough for the Republican and Democratic conventions. That\u2019s coupled with the \u201cAugust\u201d recess that bleeds into September. Then there\u2019s another respite in October so lawmakers can campaign at home. And don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s a campaign afoot among some congressional conservatives to ban a lame-duck session. They argue that Congress accomplishes little that isn\u2019t politically-charged in a lame-duck session (hence the reason some tough issues are delayed until after the election). Therefore, Congress should wrap business before the election and only let the new Congress and the new president grapple with thorny topics next year. For starters, there are the annual spending bills to fund the government. The Senate was trying last week to move through its first appropriations bill of the cycle, dealing with $37.5 million for energy and water programs. But senators got locked up on an issue about the Obama administration dealing in \u201cheavy water\u201d with Tehran as part of the Iran agreement. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ariz., engineered an amendment to prohibit the United States from buying heavy water, used in nuclear reactors, from Iran in the future. Democrats stalled Cotton\u2019s amendment and the entire bill. And so the Senate\u2019s first appropriations bill of the year lies in limbo. Come mid-month, the House will begin floor work on the 12 appropriations bills. Various sources tell Fox News the House should be able to knock out spending packages covering military construction, the legislative branch, energy and water programs, transportation issues, defense, financial services and perhaps one or two others. But floor time is at a maximum. And that\u2019s to say nothing of stray issues that could arise in even the \u201ceasy\u201d appropriations bills. Take the legislative branch measure that funds Congress. Conservatives are livid that the Library of Congress altered its search engines to strike \u201cpejorative\u201d terms such as \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d and \u201cillegal alien.\u201d Instead, Republicans want to return the old verbiage to the search engines. And it\u2019s unknown if the issue could become so nettlesome that it trips up possible Senate confirmation of Carla Hayden to become the Librarian of Congress. If confirmed, Hayden would become the first African American and first woman run the library. Yes, time is a problem for Congress. But time is only an issue because of politics. Congressional leaders control the calendar. There was a conscious decision by leaders to craft such a truncated schedule this year to accommodate both political conventions in July. One might argue that Congress could always just return to session in August if necessary to address major issues. But there isn\u2019t a lot of political will now to do much of anything. On the right, Republicans are just waiting out the Obama presidency -- and hoping for the best come November. Some Republicans are not-so-secretly hoping for an indictment of Hillary Clinton regarding her use of private emails for official business while secretary of state. But some of even the most-partisan Republicans are not terribly excited about the prospects of Trump. That\u2019s why many are already waiting for 2020. You think Congress isn\u2019t doing a lot now? Wait for that four-year, congressional cryogenic freeze. Yes, Republicans may be waiting out the Obama presidency. But many GOPers are afraid to move legislatively because Trump devoured the Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d apparatus alive. With Trump, there\u2019s no normal on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers now must make their legislative and political decisions based on an entirely new calculus. Nobody completely understands the broad dimension of the Trump Effect in the halls of Congress. Of course, some Republicans could opt for a completely different approach. Work like dogs all summer to distract from Trump. Show that Congress is effective -- even in a bipartisan way. Find a worthy negotiating partner in a lame-duck president. This builds natural distance from Trump -- if that\u2019s what Republicans want. The question is appetite. And in this political environment, no one knows what dish is most appealing to the palette.",

IT\u2019S OFFICIAL, CARTER IS OBAMA\u2019S MAN AT DEFENSEAfter a number of top choices pulled their names out of the running, President Obama has settled on former Pentagon official Ashton Carter as his nominee to replace outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. Fox News: \u201cIf confirmed by the Senate, Carter would be Obama\u2019s fourth Pentagon chief in his roughly six-year administration. The development comes less than two weeks after Hagel abruptly resigned under White House pressure, after less than two years on the job. Carter has extensive experience in the national security arena. Carter's former role was essentially that of chief operating officer. Before he served as deputy defense secretary, he was the Pentagon's technology and weapons-buying chief for more than two years.\u201d WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Today\u2019s high-paced, well-defined information age seems to leave little room for mystery. But when events like the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 over the southern Indian Ocean occur, we are reminded that the unexpected and unexplained are a very real part of our world. In that spirit, we recall that 69 years ago on this day, a flight of five U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo-bombers took off from the Ft. Lauderdale Naval Air Station in\u00a0Florida\u00a0on a routine three-hour training mission. The 14 airmen of Flight 19 never returned. Neither did the 13-man crew of the rescue Mariner aircraft sent to find them. Although the Navy maintained that the remains of the six aircraft and 27 men were not found because stormy weather destroyed the evidence, the story of the \u201cLost Squadron\u201d helped cement the legend of the\u00a0Bermuda Triangle, an area of the Atlantic Ocean where ships and aircraft are said to disappear without a trace.

Mary Landrieu\u2019s, D-La., bid to hold her seat about to end in defeat, CSM takes a deep dive into why support for Democrats is dying in the Deep South. \u201cCome Saturday, the sweep is likely to be complete.\u00a0Sen. Mary Landrieu (D)\u00a0of\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0is nearly certain to lose her runoff election against Republican challenger Bill Cassidy. In the Deep South,\u00a0that will mean no more Democrats\u00a0in\u00a0the US Senate, a governor\u2019s office, or the majority in a state legislature. This shift to deep red in the Deep South has been decades in the making. And it was only a matter of time before Louisiana was going to shift, too, analysts say. Still, one statistic stood out in Senator Landrieu\u2019s vote totals on\u00a0Election Day\u00a0last month: She got only 18 percent of the white vote, down from 33 percent just six years ago Why the precipitous decline? And what does it signal for Democrats\u2019 future chances in the South? To the first question, experts on Southern policies have a short answer: President Obama\u2026\u201dDEMS DRAFT MIDTERM AUTOPSY TEAMAP: \u201cDemocrats are turning to Kentucky Gov.

The Democratic National Committee is naming a 10-person panel to examine the party's problems during the 2014 and 2010 elections and recommend solutions. The task force is aiming to determine why Democrats have struggled to turn out its voters in non-presidential elections. It will look at the party's tactics, messaging, get-out-the-vote operations and digital efforts. It expects to complete its work by mid-2015.\u201dWRONG TURN ON THE WAY TO THE MARKETA piglet near Suffolk, England apparently went to great lengths to escape his pen. The adventurous little oinker first slithered under an electric wire fence, crossing 200 yards of farmland to the end of a cliff where he got stuck in the sand. Animal inspector Jason Finch was called by a passer-by to help rescue the piglet. Panicking by the attempted human capture, the animal fell off the cliff and started swimming out in the ocean. Finch said, \u201cI have never seen anything like it. I couldn't believe it when he darted straight into the sea like that. He was completely un-phased by the bubbling surf and started diving up and down among the waves.\u201d Finch ran into the ocean and finally scooped up the piglet bringing him back to shore. Though after the successful rescue, he was unable to report if this little piggy cried \u201cwee, wee, wee\u201d all the way home to the relieved staff at Church Farm.AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cI think anybody who looks at the [Eric Garner] video would think, that this was the wrong judgment, the problem is in our system, you don\u2019t have double jeopardy.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Whatevs! President makes clear ObamaCare numbers don\u2019t matter \u2022 Showdown in Ariz. \u2022 Gut check on Obama overreach \u2022 Sink-ing: Dem worries about getting maids, landscapers \u2022 Obama has say on size of Clinton docu-dump \u2022 Anatomy of a breakup OBAMA CELEBRATES WEAK HEALTH LAW ENROLLMENT President Obama now claims that 4 million people have signed up for ObamaCare. That\u2019s far below the number of policies cancelled under the law, so it\u2019s not too surprising that there would be a market for the program. It\u2019s also far below the 7 million enrollments to which the administration once aspired. Plus, based on the president\u2019s track record on ObamaCare statistics, we can have relatively little confidence in this number. But however many millions of people have voluntarily complied with the law, we certainly don\u2019t know how many of them have actually paid for policies or obtained coverage. It\u2019s a mess the magnitude of which we will only start to understand in the months after the current enrollment drive ends on March 31. But here\u2019s something we do know: Whatever the enrollment numbers, the president and his team will call it a victory \u2013 as Vice President Joe Biden said, \u201ca hell of a start.\u201d The wonk patrol is testing administration assumptions and warning that these crummy numbers could damage the overall viability of the law. They\u2019re missing the point, though. Once it was clear that the implementation of ObamaCare would be this ghastly, victory was off the table. The name of the game now: survive and advance. Whatevs - If you want to know how little emphasis is placed on quality when it comes to ObamaCare, consider the new revelation that the team working on the rollout plunged ahead with launch despite urgent warnings about dangers to consumer data. As one email reads \u201cThe front office is signing [authorizations to proceed] whether or not they are a high risk.\u201d That kind of sums it up for the launch and the law\u2019s ongoing travails. It\u2019s governance YOLO style. The bailouts built into the law give the president confidence that he can deluge the insurance industry with enough tax dollars to keep everything afloat for a few years, whatever happens now. That, combined with selective enforcement of troublesome provisions, ought to keep the law sputtering along until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. By then, Americans will have come to accept the new normal of ObamaCare. As the president himself says, the law will be seen as successful after he has left office. Until then, it\u2019s time to grin and bear it. Sounds like a super fun second half of your second term, Mr. President. JUST FOR THE RECORD, MADAM SECRETARY That was then - \u201cWell, I think success looks like at least seven million people having signed up by the end of March 2014.\u201d\u2014Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to NBC News, Sept. 2013. This is now - \u201cFirst of all, seven million was not the administration. That was a CBO, Congressional Budget Office, prediction when the bill was first signed. I'm not sure where they even got their numbers.\u201d \u2013 Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to Huffington Post Tuesday. A wipeout not seen since Greg Brady went surfing - LAT: \u201c\u2026[F]our months after enrollments began, the [Hawaii\u2019s ObamaCare program] has allocated $120 million while signing up only about 4,300 people for health plans \u2013 fewer than any other state.

We\u2019ve only been in the market for 5 years. This is a very burdensome tax because it is based on sales, not profits, and the only way we can pay a tax like this is to cut expenses,\u2019 OrthoPediatrics CEO Mark Throdahl told The Daily Caller.\u201d SLOW LERNER: IRS OFFICAL TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY AGAIN Lois Lerner is likely heading back to the spotlight. Fox News has obtained a letter from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., to the attorney representing Lerner, the former IRS executive at the center of the political targeting scandal at the tax-collection agency. In the letter summons Lerner to appear at a \u201ccontinuation of the May 22, 2013 hearing on March 5, 2014.\u201d Lerner left last year\u2019s hearing after invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination. To preserve the right to recall Lerner, Issa recessed the hearing. She remains under subpoena for the remainder of this Congress. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOWDOWN IN ARIZONAIn a scenario reminiscent of the furor over Arizona\u2019s tough illegal immigration law in 2010, the state\u2019s legislature has passed a bill protecting business owners who refuse to provide services for same-sex nuptials. The law has been quickly shorthanded to being \u201canti-gay\u201d and the subject of a massive backlash, with lots of moderate Republicans calling on term-limited Republican Gov. Jan Brewer to do everybody a favor and veto the bill. Even the new gay-enthusiasts at the NFL are in the mix, threatening to strip the state of next year\u2019s Super Bowl, scheduled to be played outside of Phoenix.\u00a0 Brewer\u2019s team indicated she\u2019s not likely to rush her decision, and past performance on the immigration bill and other issues does not indicate she is one who much bows to public pressure. But what if it costs lots and lots of jobs from high-profile employers? Tough spot, Madam Governor. [Attorney General Eric Holder, though, has a solution if Brewer does opt to sign the law: selective enforcement. Holder told state attorneys general that they should not work to uphold laws they find objectionable.] Bug in the code - National Review\u2019s Tim Cavanaugh sifts through the law and concludes it might actually be harmful to the goals of its proponents: \u201c[The law] sets out to fix a bug that looks to me like a feature: On the issue of the right to turn down business, Arizona does not have one code of conduct for the entire state. S.B. 1062, if I\u2019m reading it correctly, would overturn that, making it impossible for, say, Phoenix to pass a different set of laws from Prescott. You may argue that that\u2019s good, because First Amendment freedom of conscience should not be abridged by municipal authorities (who are usually the very worst of tyrants). But local abridgments of speech rights happen all the time, in the form of billboard restrictions, bans on certain kinds of advertising, and the many house-beautiful requirements zoning martinets love. This is the beauty of having 31 flavors: People in Yuma don\u2019t necessarily have to live the same way as people in Tucson. Scaled up, it\u2019s the compelling argument for \u201cexperiments in living\u201d and interstate competition. But in this case we\u2019re talking about a state governor\u2019s veto power, and so the argument needs to be scaled down. Mobility among states is easy enough; mobility within a single state is even easier. If Phoenix wants to pass a law infringing the rights of religious bakers, or Kingman wants to require everybody to sing \u201cRoute 66\u2033 once a day, they can be allowed to do so and reap the rewards or punishments. If an overwhelming majority of Arizonans were excited about S.B. 1062\u2019s aims, they could adopt it, tell the NFL to go to hell, and let dissenters head to New Mexico.\u201d GUT CHECK FOR GOP ON OBAMA OVERREACHAre House Republicans ready to take the president to court over his executive overreach? That\u2019s the question before Congress today as Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C., testifies about his legislation that would put before a judge the constitutionality of the president\u2019s ever-expanding claim to greater executive power. Previewing his testimony today in an appearance on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Rice said \u201cIf the judge finds the president\u2019s actions unconstitutional then those actions will be null and void.\u201d So how do Republicans get there? [President Obama today visits St. Paul, Minn. where he will again tout his unilateral power, extolling the program which provided $35 million to refurbish the city\u2019s old train station.] Ready to take the plunge? - Rice wants his colleagues to back a resolution finding that Obama has not faithfully executed his own health law, most notably in ignoring regulations that might make ObamaCare even more damaging.\u00a0 As Rice told Megyn Kelly, \u201cThe president has no right to delay a tax. He has no right to say that this group of people doesn\u2019t have to pay the tax.\u201d But if Rice prevails, Republicans would be in the position of arguing in court on behalf of destructive taxes, regulations and fines that would be imposed retroactively. Sounds pretty punitive for a party that bills itself as the nation\u2019s deliverance from the troubled health law. Perhaps Obama would relent and agree to sign legislation delaying the entire law if that were so, but the result would be a high-stakes game of chicken with a president who proved during the partial government shutdown last year that he does not mind bringing the pain. [Who knew 32 percent could look so good? - Gallup\u2019s latest survey finds House Speaker John Boehner holds a 32 percent favorability rating, with 50 percent disapproving, returning to levels he saw prior to the October government shutdown.]WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...

From Codgers Freaking Out: \u201cInevitably, we older people misunderstand new ways young people do things -- we are frightened by the risks and oblivious to the benefits\u2026 outrage undermines perspective. It creates a false impression of how risky the present is, and it fuels unnecessary, freedom-killing regulations. Old people always talk about the good old days. But the good old days were not so good. When I was young, more kids were intolerant, racist, sexist and homophobic. They had little knowledge of life beyond their neighborhoods.

The papers contain confidential advice given to or sought by President Bill Clinton, including communications with then-first lady Hillary Clinton, and records about people considered for appointments to federal office. About 33,000 pages of documents are involved, according to the National Archives, which runs the library. Under the Presidential Records Act, such records can be withheld for up to 12 years after a president leaves office. However, at the 12-year mark, those broad restrictions fall away and the once-secret presidential papers are generally subject to disclosure. For the Clinton files, that milestone came and went in January 2013.The long-sealed records pose a delicate series of choices for the Clintons, and even President Barack Obama. They could allow disclosure of the papers, fueling new stories about old controversies like Whitewater and pardons granted as the 42nd president left office in 2001. Or they could fight to keep some or all of the files secret, likely triggering a court battle and stoking concerns that the former president and his wife are unduly secretive\u2026 \u00a0an official with the current White House said Tuesday afternoon that a large batch of the formerly withheld Clinton records should emerge soon.\u2018The White House has cleared a significant number of P2/P5 Clinton documents \u2026 roughly 25,000 pages,\u2019 said the Obama aide, citing the legal designations originally used to withhold the records. The aide, who asked not to be named, did not say precisely when that clearance was given. However, he added: \u2018There have been no executive privilege assertions on Clinton materials to date.\u2019\u2019\u2019 RUBIO WON\u2019T BOW TO JEBThe Hill: \u201cSen.

            "article_content": "William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles Two years ago, the Obama administration referred to the surge of Central American children and families coming into the U.S. as a \"humanitarian crisis.\" This year, it's worse \u2013 as Border Patrol agents apprehend even more Honduran, Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants claiming asylum. But due to a backlog in the courts, there is even less of a chance they\u2019ll be deported. \"Where the backflow and choke point is occurring is in the immigration judge docket system -- 800,000 on the dockets right now,\" said former Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection David Aguilar. \"So, that backlog, that inability to basically send these people back, remove them back to their countries of origin, is causing a draw of more of these people coming into the country.\" According to the latest CBP figures, agents detained 27,754 unaccompanied minors from Central America in the first six months of the fiscal year, almost double last year's total of 15,616 and just shy of the 2014 record of 28,579. The numbers for immigrants traveling as families is even higher, with 32,117 apprehended -- almost triple last year's total of 13,913 and well above the 2014 \u201csurge\u201d figure of 19,830. Taken together, the exodus from Central America\u00a0represents the largest mass immigration to the U.S. since the Mariel boatlift out of Cuba in 1980. \"These people are allowed to remain here. They are given employment authorization -- therefore, they are sending a message back home 'come on over',\" Aguilar said. There are push-and-pull factors to any mass immigration, but agents and immigration experts point to several drivers. Agents are concerned the system, though, is so overwhelmed that few immigrants\u2019 criminal records are adequately checked, endangering the public. \"We don't know who we're releasing and we don't know what they're capable of,\" said Shawn Moran, a Border Patrol agent in California and a member of the union. Fellow agent and union representative Art Del Cueto echoed, \"You can't find out if they've murdered, you can't find out if they've molested minors.\" The immigration rush isn't just at the southern border. According to the Department of Homeland Security, almost 500,000 immigrants who entered the U.S. legally last year overstayed their visa. Yet, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency removed fewer than 3,000 overstays, or less than 1 percent. \"Over 40 percent of the illegal entries, illegal people that stay in the United States come in by visa and just plain overstay,\" said Aguilar. \"So the ability to locate them, to identify them and put them in removal proceedings and very critically remove them as quickly as possible from the country is critical.\" The U.S. does not have the means to easily track visa overstays, despite a law and millions of dollars appropriated by Congress to do so.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz reacts to members of the media attempting to justify why their reporting is so negative towards Donald Trump The media\u2019s legions of Trump-bashers are finally acknowledging the obvious. And trying their best to justify it. But there\u2019s one problem: Tilting against one candidate in a presidential election can\u2019t be justified. This is not a defense of Donald Trump, who has been at war with much of the press since he got in the race. Too many people think if you criticize the way the billionaire is being covered, you are somehow backing Trump. And it\u2019s not about the commentators, on the right as well as the left, who are savaging Trump, since they are paid for their opinions. This is about the mainstream media\u2019s reporters, editors and producers, whose credo is supposed to be fairness. And now some of them are flat-out making the case for unfairness\u2014an unprecedented approach for an unprecedented campaign. Put aside, for the moment, the longstanding complaints about journalists being unfair to Republicans. They never treated Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush or Bob Dole like this. Keep in mind that the media utterly misjudged Trump from the start, covering him as a joke or a sideshow or a streaking comet that would burn itself out. Many of them later confessed how wrong they had been, and that they had missed the magnitude of the anger and frustration that fueled Trump\u2019s unlikely rise. But since the conventions, and fueled by his own missteps, Trump has been hit by a tsunami of negative coverage, all but swamping the reporting on Hillary Clinton. Liberal investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald recently told Slate that \u201cthe U.S. media is essentially 100 percent united, vehemently, against Trump, and preventing him from being elected president\u201d\u2014and, given his views, he has no problem with that. Now comes Jim Rutenberg, in his first season as media columnist for the New York Times. He\u2019s a good reporter and I give him credit for trying to openly grapple with this bizarre situation. But Rutenberg is, in my view, trying to defend the indefensible: \u201cIf you view a Trump presidency as something that\u2019s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you\u2019ve ever been to being oppositional. That\u2019s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, nonopinion journalist I\u2019ve ever known, and by normal standards, untenable.\u201d Yet normal standards, says Rutenberg, may not apply. By \u201ccloser to being oppositional,\u201d he means openly siding against Trump and thereby helping Clinton. And that\u2019s precisely the kind of thing that erodes our already damaged credibility. If a reporter believes Trump is a threat to America, he or she should go into the opinion business, or quit the media world and work against him. You can\u2019t maintain the fig leaf of neutral reporting and favor one side. Rutenberg acknowledges that \u201cbalance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy. For the primaries and caucuses, the imbalance played to his advantage, captured by the killer statistic of the season: His nearly $2 billion in free media was more than six times as much as that of his closest Republican rival.\u201d I have to push back on this $2-billion argument. Trump got more coverage not just because he was good for clicks and ratings, but because he did many, many times more interviews than anyone else running. Much of this \u201cfree\u201d media, rather than being a gift, was harshly negative. But that too helped Trump, because he drove the campaign dialogue and openly campaigned against the press. Next Rutenberg argues that Trump is just too over the top in his rhetoric: \u201cAnd while coded appeals to racism or nationalism aren\u2019t new \u2014 two words: Southern strategy \u2014 overt calls to temporarily bar Muslims from entry to the United States or questioning a federal judge\u2019s impartiality based on his Mexican heritage are new.\u201d What\u2019s disappointing is that Rutenberg doesn\u2019t cite a single example of biased coverage from his paper, or any other paper or news outlet. (He does point to criticism from MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who is, as the columnist acknowledges, a commentator.) Instead he quotes Carolyn Ryan, the Times\u2019 senior editor for politics, as saying Trump\u2019s candidacy is \u201cextraordinary and precedent-shattering\u201d and \u201cto pretend otherwise is to be disingenuous with readers.\u201d And Rutenberg agrees, saying it would \u201cbe an abdication of political journalism\u2019s most solemn duty: to ferret out what the candidates will be like in the most powerful office in the world.\u201d No one wants to abdicate that duty. No one is pretending Trump\u2019s candidacy isn\u2019t extraordinary. No one is saying he shouldn\u2019t be fully vetted. But there is an assumption among many journalists and pundits that of course Hillary Clinton is qualified, she\u2019s been around forever, she just doesn\u2019t need the relentless reporting that Trump requires. And so critical stories about Clinton\u2014even when she said she \u201cshort-circuited\u201d in that Chris Wallace interview on the email mess\u2014are overshadowed by the endless piling on Trump. Many of the reporters who feel compelled to stop Trump are undoubtedly comfortable because all their friends feel the same way. But they are deluding themselves if they think that going after one candidate in a two-candidate race is what journalism is about.",

            "article_content": "William La Jeunesse reports from Nogales, Arizona Americans aren\u2019t the only ones motivated by Tuesday\u2019s election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. \u201cSmugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there\u2019s a chance,\u201d said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. \u201cPeople think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,\u201d said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. \u201cAnother faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they\u2019ll get amnesty if they\u2019re here by a certain date.\u201d Those two competing narratives \u2013 triggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively -- are driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn\u2019t seen in years in some sectors. \u201cWe are overwhelmed,\u201d said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. \u201cWe are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.\u201d In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide -- and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming\u00a0to be from Africa and Asia also is up. \"There are always going to be push and pull factors that influence an individual\u2019s decision to make that trek,\" said Tucson Border Patrol Sector Chief Paul Beeson. The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their\u00a0\u2018asylum\u2019 claim. \u201cWhen you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m here for asylum, I can\u2019t go home because they\u2019ll kill me.\u2019 \u2026 When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,\u201d said Cabrera. \u201cOnce they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we\u2019ll never see them again.\u201d Del Cueto said the agents are \u201cnot getting any backing\u201d from D.C. and \u201cwe need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.\u201d Del Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrol\u2019s 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media. While Central American immigrants have posed the biggest resource challenge for Texas, they say a surge of Haitians are pouring into ports of entry in California and Arizona. Last year, the U.S. saw a 500 percent increase of Haitians admitted to the U.S., double that in San Diego where right now 2,000 are waiting outside the port in San Ysidro.\u00a0According to Homeland Security sources, another 2,000 are in Mexicali and several hundred are in San Luis, just south of Yuma where Del Cueto says immigrants are sleeping in a church parking lot. Further east in Nogales, Mexico, 150 are waiting to cross into the U.S. They are camped next to the border fence, waiting for Customs and Border Protection officers to process them as refugees. Some had jewelry and one woman had an iPad. The men surrounded the women, who huddled around a pile of boxes containing water and food. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in Nogales 20 days,\u201d said one middle-aged man in a striped shirt in broken English. \u201cWe need help crossing the border.\u201d He said each immigrant paid a $4,000 to $6,000 smuggling fee. Once here, he said the Mexican government had given each a number based on their arrival. \u201cWe are seeing an uptick in the number of Haitians that are looking for an immigration benefit,\u201d\u00a0said Beeson, who admits the surge is taking agents off the front lines. Following the earthquake several years ago, Haitians were allowed to immigrate and stay in the U.S. under a program known as \u2019Temporary Protected Status.\u2019 Earlier this year, the U.S. ended that protection, leaving some Haitians in the pipeline traveling through Mexico, where according to officials there, roughly 8,000 are on their way to the border. While Trump and Clinton have very different visions of immigration reform and border security, Stratfor\u2019s Scott Stewart doesn\u2019t see the border threat changing until conditions do south of the border. \u201cThere\u2019s really no easy answer to it because there are just deeper issues,\u201d said Stewart, from the defense and security think tank. \u201cYou have pervasive corruption where you see all levels of government are involved in, you know, drug dealing and other criminal activity. \u2026 So these things all tie together and make it a very difficult place for people to live and survive and because of that it\u2019s very understandable why people would want to migrate from those conditions up to the United States.\u201d",

(REUTERS/Mike Segar) Donald Trump is ranking higher than Hillary Clinton in Google searches on the eve of the U.S. election, as voters hunt for information on the Republican presidential nominee. Data released by Google show Trump dominating search in 38 states early afternoon Monday, including the battleground states of Florida and Michigan. Google data also show that immigration is the top Trump-related search topic, followed by abortion and race issues. \u201cIf you take a deeper look at the information, you\u2019ll see that the top five related searches to Mr. Trump are immigration, race, abortion, ISIS, and the economy - all hot button issues throughout this campaign,\u201d said social media expert and President of JRM Comm Jason Mollica, in an email to FoxNews.com. \u201cWhen it comes to Mr. Trump, people still want to know more. It also means that potential voters want to read what he said in the last 24-48 hours.\u201d SNAPPING A SELFIE WITH YOUR BALLOT COULD GET YOUR VOTE TOSSED OUT Mollica noted, however, that the search data from Google should not be seen as a surge of voting for Trump. \u201cIt does mean that people are actively gathering and reading information in the last hours before Election Day,\u201d he added. The hotly contested battle between Trump and Clinton is clearly generating huge interest in the U.S. electorate. Google has seen an incredible 233 percent increase in \u201chow to vote\u201d searches compared to the period before the 2012 presidential election. People are also actively searching for \u201cwhere to vote\u201d, particularly in battleground states. TRUMP, CLINTON, TIE IN GOOGLE DEBATE SEARCHES Additionally, Google has launched a new election Doodle that shows the letters holding signs with the word \u2018vote\u2019 in different languages. When users click on the Doodle and type in their address, Google generates information on their nearest polling station, along with voting requirements and ballot details. Twitter is also encouraging people to vote. The social media giant is promoting the #ElectionDay and #Election2016 hashtag and emoji, as well as providing information to voters via its @Gov Twitter Government account. Voters, for example, can direct message @Gov to find their polling place and ballot information. #ElectionDay is almost here! Remember: you cannot vote via text or Tweet. Direct Message @Gov to find your polling place and ballot info. pic.twitter.com/vS5YXN0uXp \u201c#ElectionFinalThoughts\u201d and \u201cTrump White House\u201d are top trending Twitter topics Monday. PENCE DOMINATED TWITTER DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE Facebook has a \u201cGet Ready for Election Day\u201d that lets voters preview their ballot and provides information on the candidates, from presidential through to the local level. Technology is being widely used to provide information for voters in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election. Analytics software specialist Rhiza, for example, has launched \u201cMy Pundit\u201d, a free tool for Amazon Alexa-powered devices that compiles voter registration, polling and fact checking data.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee says convention occurs at a moment of crisis for America, nation can't afford to be politically correct Below are the remarks, as prepared for delivery, by businessman Donald Trump in accepting the GOP nomination for president at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I\u00a0humbly and gratefully accept your nomination\u00a0for the presidency of the United States. Who would have believed that when we started\u00a0this journey on June 16th of last year we \u2013 and\u00a0I say \u201cwe\u201d because we are a team \u2013 would\u00a0have received almost 14 million votes, the most\u00a0in the history of the Republican Party, and that\u00a0the Republican Party would get 60 percent\u00a0more votes than it received four years ago? The Democrats, on the other hand, received\u00a0almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got\u00a0four years ago. Together, we will lead our party back to the\u00a0White House, and we will lead our country\u00a0back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth.\u00a0But we will also be a country of law and order. Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis\u00a0for our nation.\u00a0The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in\u00a0our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger\u00a0is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have\u00a0seen the recent images of violence in our\u00a0streets and the chaos in our communities.\u00a0Many have witnessed this violence personally,\u00a0some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and\u00a0violence that today afflicts our nation will soon\u00a0come to an end.\u00a0Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be\u00a0restored. The most basic duty of government is to defend\u00a0the lives of its own citizens.\u00a0Any government that fails to do so is a\u00a0government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward\u00a0assessment of the state of our nation.\u00a0I will present the facts plainly and honestly.\u00a0We cannot afford to be so politically correct\u00a0anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the\u00a0carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths --\u00a0the Democrats are holding their convention\u00a0next week.\u00a0But here, at our convention, there will be no\u00a0lies. We will honor the American people with the\u00a0truth, and nothing else. These are the facts: Decades of progress\u00a0made in bringing down crime are now being\u00a0reversed by this Administration\u2019s rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in\u00a0America\u2019s fifty largest cities.\u00a0That\u2019s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation\u2019s capital, killings have risen by 50\u00a0percent.\u00a0They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore. In the President\u2019s hometown of Chicago, more\u00a0than 2,000 people have been the victims of\u00a0shootings this year alone.\u00a0And almost 4,000 have been killed in the\u00a0Chicago area since he took office. The number of police officers killed in the line\u00a0of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to\u00a0this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal\u00a0records, ordered deported from our country,\u00a0are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful\u00a0citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families\u00a0who have crossed the border so far this year\u00a0already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of\u00a0thousands into our communities with no regard\u00a0for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and\u00a0made his way to Nebraska.\u00a0There, he ended the life of an innocent young\u00a0girl named Sarah Root.\u00a0She was 21 years old, and was killed the day\u00a0after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade\u00a0Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and\u00a0he is now a fugitive from the law. I\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s beautiful family.\u00a0But to this Administration, their amazing\u00a0daughter was just one more American life that\u00a0wasn\u2019t worth protecting. One more American child to sacrifice on the\u00a0altar of open borders. What about our economy?\u00a0Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have\u00a0been edited out of your nightly news and your\u00a0morning newspaper: Nearly four in 10 African-American children\u00a0are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than\u00a0when President Obama took his oath of office\u00a0less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the\u00a0workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000\u00a0since the year 2000 \u2013 16\u00a0years ago. Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly $800\u00a0billion last year alone. The budget is no better.\u00a0President Obama has almost doubled our\u00a0national debt to more than 19 trillion dollars,\u00a0and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads\u00a0and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in\u00a0Third World condition, and forty-three million\u00a0Americans are on food stamps. Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic\u00a0disaster, but they have lived through one\u00a0international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors\u00a0being forced to their knees by their Iranian\u00a0captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran\u00a0deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion\u00a0and gave us nothing \u2013 it will go down in history\u00a0as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria \u2013 and the whole world knew it meant nothing. In Libya, our consulate \u2013 the symbol of\u00a0American prestige around the globe \u2013 was\u00a0brought down in flames. America is far less safe \u2013 and the world is far\u00a0less stable \u2013 than when Obama made the\u00a0decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of\u00a0America\u2019s foreign policy.\u00a0I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgement \u2013something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u2013 are\u00a0what caused so many of the disasters unfolding\u00a0today. Let\u2019s review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the\u00a0map.\u00a0Libya was stable.\u00a0Egypt was peaceful.\u00a0Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\u00a0Iran was being choked by sanctions.\u00a0Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we\u00a0have?\u00a0ISIS has spread across the region, and the\u00a0world.\u00a0Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his\u00a0staff were left helpless to die at the hands of\u00a0savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim\u00a0brotherhood, forcing the military to retake\u00a0control. Iraq is in chaos.\u00a0Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.\u00a0Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee\u00a0crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East,\u00a0after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of\u00a0lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever\u00a0been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death,\u00a0destruction, terrorism and weakness. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be\u00a0America\u2019s legacy. The problems we face now \u2013 poverty and\u00a0violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2013\u00a0will last only as long as we continue relying on\u00a0the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to produce\u00a0a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action\u00a0for America. The most important difference between our\u00a0plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan\u00a0will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not\u00a0put America First, then we can be assured that\u00a0other nations will not treat America with\u00a0respect. This will all change when I take office.\u00a0The American People will come first once\u00a0again. My plan will begin with safety at home \u2013 which\u00a0means safe neighborhoods, secure borders,\u00a0and protection from terrorism.\u00a0There can be no prosperity without law and\u00a0order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add\u00a0millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth\u00a0that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline\u00a0tonight will be opposed by some of our nation\u2019s\u00a0most powerful special interests.\u00a0That is because these interests have rigged our\u00a0political and economic system for their\u00a0exclusive benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are\u00a0lining up behind the campaign of my opponent\u00a0because they know she will keep our rigged\u00a0system in place. They are throwing money at her because they\u00a0have total control over everything she does.\u00a0She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton\u2019s message is that\u00a0things will never change. My message is that things have to change \u2013and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a\u00a0better life for the people all across this nation\u00a0that have been ignored, neglected and\u00a0abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and\u00a0the communities crushed by our horrible and\u00a0unfair trade deals.\u00a0These are the forgotten men and women of our\u00a0country.\u00a0People who work hard but no longer have a\u00a0voice. I AM YOUR VOICE. I have embraced crying mothers who have lost\u00a0their children because our politicians put their\u00a0personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance\u00a0for government incompetence, no sympathy for\u00a0leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our\u00a0political system lacks the will, or the courage,\u00a0or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u2013 or\u00a0worse still, has sold out to some corporate\u00a0lobbyist for cash \u2013 I am not able to look the\u00a0other way. And when a Secretary of State illegally stores\u00a0her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000\u00a0of them so the authorities can\u2019t see her crime,\u00a0puts our country at risk, lies about it in every\u00a0different form and faces no consequence \u2013 I\u00a0know that corruption has reached a level like\u00a0never before. When the FBI Director says that the Secretary\u00a0of State was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and\u00a0\u201cnegligent,\u201d in handling our classified secrets, I\u00a0also know that these terms are minor compared\u00a0to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing\u00a0justice for her terrible crimes. In fact, her single greatest accomplishment\u00a0may be committing such an egregious crime\u00a0and getting away with it \u2013 especially when\u00a0others, who have done far less, have paid so\u00a0dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in\u00a0millions of dollars trading access and favors to\u00a0special interests and foreign powers I know the\u00a0time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the\u00a0powerful can no longer beat up on people who\u00a0cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me,\u00a0which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged\u00a0against our citizens, just like it was rigged\u00a0against Bernie Sanders \u2013 he never had a\u00a0chance. But his supporters will join our movement,\u00a0because we will fix his biggest issue: trade\u00a0deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth.\u00a0Millions of Democrats will join our movement,\u00a0because we are going to fix the system so it\u00a0works fairly, and justly, for each and every\u00a0American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen\u00a0continued threats and violence against our law\u00a0enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on\u00a0all Americans. I have a message to every last person\u00a0threatening the peace on our streets and the\u00a0safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to\u00a0our country. I will work with, and appoint, the best and\u00a0brightest prosecutors and law enforcement\u00a0officials to get the job done.\u00a0In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President,\u00a0who has used the pulpit of the presidency to\u00a0divide us by race and color, has made America\u00a0a more dangerous environment for everyone. This Administration has failed America\u2019s inner\u00a0cities. It\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed them on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime. It\u2019s failed them in every way and on every level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that\u00a0all of our kids are treated equally, and\u00a0protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this\u00a0make life better for young Americans in\u00a0Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have the same right to live out their dreams as\u00a0any other child in America? To make life safe for all our citizens, we must\u00a0also address the growing threats we face from\u00a0outside the country: we are going to defeat the\u00a0barbarians of ISIS. Once again, France is the victim of brutal\u00a0Islamic terrorism.\u00a0Men, women and children viciously mowed\u00a0down.\u00a0Lives ruined.\u00a0Families ripped apart.\u00a0A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be\u00a0inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven\u00a0over and over \u2013 at the World Trade Center, at\u00a0an office party in San Bernardino, at the\u00a0Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center\u00a0in Chattanooga, and many more. Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49\u00a0wonderful Americans were savagely murdered\u00a0by an Islamic terrorist.\u00a0This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBTQ community. As your President, I will do everything in my\u00a0power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the\u00a0violence and oppression of a hateful foreign\u00a0ideology. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus\u00a0on three things. We must have the best intelligence-gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who\u00a0share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping\u00a0out Islamic terror.\u00a0This includes working with our greatest ally in\u00a0the region, the State of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete,\u00a0because it did not properly cover terror, and\u00a0also, that many of the member countries were\u00a0not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking\u00a0up the cost.\u00a0Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO\u00a0will be setting up a new program in order to\u00a0combat terrorism -- a true step in the right\u00a0direction. Lastly, we must immediately suspend\u00a0immigration from any nation that has been\u00a0compromised by terrorism until such time as\u00a0proven vetting mechanisms have been put in\u00a0place. My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent\u00a0increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing\u00a0massive refugee flows coming into our country\u00a0under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there\u2019s\u00a0no way to screen these refugees in order to\u00a0find out who they are or where they come\u00a0from. I only want to admit individuals into our country\u00a0who will support our values and love our\u00a0people.\u00a0Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or\u00a0oppression is not welcome in our country and\u00a0never will be. Decades of record immigration have produced\u00a0lower wages and higher unemployment for our\u00a0citizens, especially for African-American and\u00a0Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system\u00a0that works, but one that works for the American\u00a0people. On Monday, we heard from three parents\u00a0whose children were killed by illegal immigrants\u00a0Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and\u00a0Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of\u00a0many thousands who have suffered so gravely.\u00a0Of all my travels in this country, nothing has\u00a0affected me more deeply than the time I have\u00a0spent with the mothers and fathers who have\u00a0lost their children to violence spilling across our\u00a0border. These families have no special interests to\u00a0represent them.\u00a0There are no demonstrators to protest on their\u00a0behalf.\u00a0My opponent will never meet with them, or\u00a0share in their pain.\u00a0Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?\u00a0Where was the sanctuary for the children of\u00a0Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was the sanctuary for all the other\u00a0Americans who have been so brutally\u00a0murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been\u00a0alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation\u00a0stand in their corner to support them, to send\u00a0them our love, and to pledge in their honor that\u00a0we will save countless more families from\u00a0suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to\u00a0stop illegal immigration, to stop the drugs from\u00a0pouring into our communities, and to stop the\u00a0gangs and the violence that have stolen too\u00a0many innocent lives. I have been honored to receive the\u00a0endorsement of America\u2019s Border Patrol\u00a0Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system. By ending catch-and-release on the border, we\u00a0will end the cycle of human smuggling and\u00a0violence.\u00a0Illegal border crossings will go down.\u00a0Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who\u00a0overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive\u00a0the respect they deserve. Tonight, I want every American whose\u00a0demands for immigration security have been\u00a0denied \u2013 and every politician who has denied them \u2013 to listen very closely to the words am about to say. On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the\u00a0oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in\u00a0a country where the laws of the United States\u00a0are enforced. We are going to be considerate and\u00a0compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own\u00a0struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty,\u00a0mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.\u00a0Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty. I have a different vision for our workers.\u00a0It begins with a new, fair trade policy that\u00a0protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. It\u2019s been a signature message of my campaign\u00a0from day one, and it will be a signature feature\u00a0of my presidency from the moment I take the\u00a0oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business\u00a0making deals \u2013 now I\u2019m going to make our\u00a0country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements\u00a0into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly one-third of its\u00a0manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the\u00a0enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever\u00a0made by our country. Never again. I am going to bring back our jobs to Ohio, and\u00a0Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan\u00a0and to all of America \u2013 and I am not going to let\u00a0companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. My opponent, on the other hand, has supported\u00a0virtually every trade agreement that has been\u00a0destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported\u00a0China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade\u00a0Organization \u2013 another one of her husband\u2019s colossal mistakes. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific\u00a0Partnership \u2013 which will not only destroy our\u00a0manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that\u00a0hurts our workers, or that diminishes our\u00a0freedom and independence.\u00a0Instead, I will make individual deals with\u00a0individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive\u00a0transactions, with many countries, that are\u00a0thousands of pages long \u2013 and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations\u00a0against any country that cheats.\u00a0This includes stopping China\u2019s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China, and\u00a0many others, will be totally renegotiated.\u00a0That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a\u00a0much better deal for America \u2013 and we\u2019ll walk\u00a0away if we don\u2019t get the deal that we want. Our country is going to start building and\u00a0making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws,\u00a0regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax\u00a0increase, I have proposed the largest tax\u00a0reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year \u2013 Democrat or Republican.\u00a0Middle-income Americans and businesses will\u00a0experience profound relief, and taxes will be\u00a0greatly simplified for everyone. America is one of the highest-taxed nations in\u00a0the world.\u00a0Reducing taxes will cause new companies and\u00a0new jobs to come roaring back into our\u00a0country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of\u00a0regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of\u00a0them all.\u00a0Excessive regulation is costing our country as\u00a0much as $2 trillion a year, and we will\u00a0end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the\u00a0production of American energy.\u00a0This will produce more than $20 trillion in\u00a0job-creating economic activity over the next\u00a0four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put\u00a0the great miners and steel workers of our\u00a0country out of work \u2013 that will never happen\u00a0when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of\u00a0dollars will start flowing into our country.\u00a0This new wealth will improve the quality of life\u00a0for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges,\u00a0tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.\u00a0This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by\u00a0helping their parents send them to a safe\u00a0school of their choice.\u00a0My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats\u00a0than serve American children. We will repeal and replace disastrous\u00a0Obamacare.\u00a0You will be able to choose your own doctor\u00a0again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We're going to work with all of our students\u00a0who are drowning in debt to take the pressure\u00a0off these young people just starting out their\u00a0adult lives. We will completely rebuild our depleted military,\u00a0and the countries that we are protecting, at a\u00a0massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their\u00a0fair share. We will take care of our great Veterans like\u00a0they have never been taken care of before.\u00a0My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country\u00a0will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their\u00a0choice. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal \u2013 one\u00a0more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in\u00a0government to provide a list of wasteful\u00a0spending projects that we can eliminate in my\u00a0first 100 days.\u00a0The politicians have talked about it, I\u2019m going to\u00a0do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the\u00a0United States Supreme Court who will uphold\u00a0our laws and our Constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia\u00a0will be a person of similar views, principles, and\u00a0judicial philosophy.\u00a0This will be one of the most important issues\u00a0decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the\u00a02nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received\u00a0the early and strong endorsement of the\u00a0National Rifle Association and will protect the\u00a0right of all Americans to keep their families\u00a0safe. At this moment, I would like to thank the\u00a0evangelical and religious community in general\u00a0who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have much to contribute to our politics, yet\u00a0our laws prevent you from speaking your minds\u00a0from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson,\u00a0many years ago, threatens religious institutions\u00a0with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they\u00a0openly advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that\u00a0language and protect free speech for all\u00a0Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so\u00a0much more \u2013 all we need to do is start believing\u00a0in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America\u00a0Is Back \u2013 bigger, and better and stronger than\u00a0ever before. In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side\u00a0my wife Melania and my wonderful children,\u00a0Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will\u00a0always be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and\u00a0hardest working man I ever knew.\u00a0I wonder sometimes what he\u2019d say if he were here to see this tonight. It\u2019s because of him that I learned, from my\u00a0youngest age, to respect the dignity of work\u00a0and the dignity of working people.\u00a0He was a guy most comfortable in the company\u00a0of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and\u00a0I have a lot of that in me also. Then there\u2019s my mother, Mary.\u00a0She was strong, but also warm and fairminded.\u00a0She was a truly great mother.\u00a0She was also one of the most honest and\u00a0charitable people have ever known, and a great judge of character. To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my\u00a0brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will\u00a0always give you my love you are most special\u00a0to me. I have had a truly great life in business.\u00a0But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go\u00a0to work for our country \u2013 to go to work for you.\u00a0It\u2019s time to deliver a victory for the American\u00a0people. But to do that, we must break free from the\u00a0petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and\u00a0strivers that is being led by a group of censors,\u00a0critics, and cynics. Remember: all of the people telling you that you\u00a0can\u2019t have the country you want, are the same\u00a0people telling you that I wouldn\u2019t be standing\u00a0here tonight. No longer can we rely on those same people in\u00a0the media, and politics, who will say anything to\u00a0keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\u00a0History is watching us now. It\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion,\u00a0and if we will show the whole world that\u00a0America is still free and independent and\u00a0strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can\u00a0be your champion in the White House. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a\u00a0three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d. I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \u201cI\u2019M WITH YOU \u2013 THE\u00a0AMERICAN PEOPLE.\u201d I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child,\u00a0and every child who dreams for their future, I\u00a0say these words to you tonight:\u00a0I\u2019m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and\u00a0in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. God bless You And Good Night.",

He works for Taharka Brothers, an ice-cream company with a social mission. \"Our race issues aren't necessarily toward individuals who are white, but it is towards the system that keeps us all down, one, but keeps black people disproportionally down a lot more than anybody else,\" says Cornish.

Another peers though a fence at the Mexican border to see the grandmother she left behind 18 years before, when she was brought to the United States as a toddler. Health care and immigration are two of the most contentious issues of this most contentious election year, but they are not merely grist for politics and politicians. Americans like these women, Lesia Crigger and Eva Lara, are dealing with them in nearly every moment of their everyday lives. A team of Associated Press photographers traversed the country to record those moments. Each set out to capture a single, intimate image to illustrate the human side of immigration, the economy, the environment, gun rights, social values like abortion, gay rights and conservative Christian beliefs, and race. The result: A mosaic of a people at a singular time, struggling to extend the American project through the treacherous shoals of the 21st century. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE \u2014 This story is part of Divided America, AP's ongoing exploration of the economic, social and political divisions in American society.",

I am a S.O.B. -- son of a butcher. I was raised as a white, middle class kid in the greatest country in world history. I was taught by my wonderful, true red, white and blue, patriotic, salt-of-the-earth American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are: Faith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. Well, don\u2019t look now. Everything from that list above\u2026everything we believe in\u2026everything that made America great\u2026has been under full scale assault for eight long years -- from multiple directions. And Hillary Clinton is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama\u2019s third term. So\u2026we have only a few days left, before it\u2019s all over. The truth is, we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love...the America created by our Founding Fathers....is finished.\u00a0Forever. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I\u2019m not being hysterical. I\u2019m just explaining the facts. Trump is our last chance to turn it all around. It\u2019s Trump\u2026or\u00a0America continues a long decline towards the bottom. Because if Trump doesn\u2019t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before, to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great. Illegals immigrants no longer come here \"for a love of America.\" They come for a love of welfare, food stamps, housing allowances, free medical, free education, free meals at school, free English as second language classes\u2026and don\u2019t forget $3,000 welfare payments disguised as \"earned income tax credits,\" for people who paid no taxes. Illegals come here for the cradle to grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote for Democrats forever to keep the checks coming. That\u2019s Hillary\u2019s plan. Don\u2019t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks, train them to vote Democratic to keep the checks and handouts coming.\u00a0It worked! That was the experiment. Call it Plan A. Now Democrats are onto Plan B. The plan is to flood the country with illegals and foreigners who don\u2019t share our values or love of America. The plan is to turn the rest of America into California. Hillary will flood the country with millions more. Hillary will legalize the 15 million or so already here -- and give them the right to vote. Hillary will allow those 15 million to quickly and easily bring in millions of their relatives and friends. Hillary will also import millions of Muslim refugees -- people who will need instant welfare and food stamps, very few of whom speak our language, very few of whom believe in American exceptionalism, our Constitution, or Judeo-Christian values. This is the four-step plan. Then it\u2019s over for America. In four years we\u2019ll be\u00a0California-cated. We will never win a popular vote for president again. Donald Trump is our last chance to ever again elect a Republican president. It\u2019s Donald Trump\u2026or it\u2019s the end of the GOP on the national level\u2026and the end of America. So don\u2019t even think of staying home\u2026or taking a vacation\u2026or registering a \u201cprotest vote\u201d on Gary Johnson\u2026or Evan McMullen. Don\u2019t even think of staying home because you\u2019re a Christian and Trump is not your cup of tea. Think of the Supreme Court. Think of open borders. Think of millions of Muslim refugees imported by Hillary to turn America into Western Europe. Think of your children\u2019s future. Think of the future of your unborn grandchildren. Think of your job. Think of your middle class life. Think of ObamaCare expanded to single payer like bankrupt Europe. Think of capitalism, American exceptionalism, Judeo-Christian values. Think of this as the last time you can EVER elect a Republican. Think of this as Trump\u2026or the end of America. Then vote like you\u2019ve never voted before. Vote for Trump like... It\u2019s Trump, or the end of America. Because it is.",

Mormons gather for a twice-yearly conference to hear spiritual guidance from top leaders during a testy presidential election and as society grapples with issues of race and sexuality. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (The Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 Mormons are gathering in Salt Lake City to listen to speeches from church leaders at a twice-yearly conference. More than 100,000 members of the faith are expected to attend five sessions in Salt Lake City that span Saturday and Sunday. Thousands more will listen or watch around the world on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' conference comes amid an intense presidential election in the U.S. and as members around the world grapple with the increasing needs of refugees. Church leaders could talk more about their push to be welcoming toward refugees at a time when some others are tightening the hatches. Mormon leaders sent a letter a year ago urging its members to help and launched a refugee relief effort campaign in March called \"I Was A Stranger.\" Last month, the church posted a new video on its website showing how members can mentor refugees. Mormon leaders are not expected to mention presidential candidates by name, but they could advocate again for public civility and compassion. Their mostly Republican members are trying to decide how to vote in November amid a general distaste for the brash Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump's inability to connect with Mormon voters has led to significantly fewer Latter-day Saints identifying as Republicans this year compared with four years ago when Mitt Romney, a Mormon himself, was the party's presidential nominee, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Leaders may also advocate for religious liberty protections, a popular topic in recent years for the faith. Mormon leaders have been preaching the importance of preserving religious liberty while also calling on members to accept and adhere to the legalization of same-sex marriage by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

            "article_content": "Law allows police to question status of possible illegal immigrants A pair of veteran immigration judges have left a widely read legal journal over its ban on the term \"illegal alien,\" calling the decision a case of the \"political correctness word police\" taking control of the immigration debate. Retired U.S. Immigration Court judges Mahlon \"Mick\" Hanson and Elizabeth Hacker, who wrote opinion articles for Law360's \"expert analysis\" section since the beginning of this year, say they used the term \"illegal alien\" without issue. But when they submitted an article in July on sanctuary cities, the editors of the publication declined to publish it unless certain changes were made,\u00a0including the removal of the term illegal alien. \"Language must conform to Law360 style, avoiding what is perceived to be derogatory reference to 'illegal aliens,'\" Christian Lewis, assistant managing editor of Law360, wrote in a July 30 email to Dale Wilcox of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, who was submitting the piece on behalf of the judges because they are IRLI board members. \"The only legally correct term is 'illegal alien.'\" \"I understand based on the authors' June 10 article that they believe this is a semantic argument, however our publication does follow the rule that 'illegal' applies to actions, not individuals,\" Lewis wrote. Law360 -- a subscription, legal news source which boasts a readership of 400,000 and is operated by the Portfolio Media company, a subsidiary of LexisNexis --\u00a0first suggested the judges change the language to \"undocumented alien\" and then \"unauthorized alien.\" In addition, Lewis questioned the sources used by the seasoned immigration jurists in writing their piece, which roundly criticized sanctuary cities following the July 1 murder of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle. Francisco Sanchez, an illegal alien, is accused of killing Steinle, who was shot while walking with her father in San Francisco. Sanctuary cities are communities that have an official policy of not cooperating with federal authorities in the detention of illegal immigrants or handing them over for deportation. Critics of the term say the word \"illegal\" should be used to describe actions, but not people. The judges said they were \"shocked\" by the editorial board's insistence the term not be used -- noting the Immigration & Nationality Act and its various amendments use \"illegal alien,\" as do judges presiding over immigration law cases nationwide. A LexisNexis search of the term's use in case law generates thousands of examples. Hanson and Hacker said they trimmed their article at the editors' request and clarified their sources, but refused to resubmit the piece with language they deemed legally incorrect. \"I was, quite frankly, very surprised,\" Hacker told FoxNews.com. \"We had submitted several other articles to them on immigration-related issues and had used that term, which we consider to be the legally correct term.\" \"I don't want to use inappropriate language, which in my opinion is designed to deceive people as to the state of affairs in the immigration area,\" Hacker said. \"The only legally correct term is 'illegal alien,'\" added Hanson. Hacker, (r.), was appointed a US Immigration judge in 1995, and believes the  term \"illegal alien\" is accurate and inoffensive. In an email to FoxNews.com, Law360 explained that it is simply complying with The Associated Press guidelines for journalists. In 2013, the AP dropped the use of the word \"illegal\" to describe a person who enters or resides in a country in violation of civil or criminal law. \"Like many other news organizations, Law360 follows Associated Press style on the use of the term \"illegal immigrant,\" Cat Fredenburgh, editor-in-chief of Law360, said in the email. \"Per AP, Law360 uses the term 'illegal' to refer only to actions, not people. Law360 requires all third-party contributors to comply with our style guidelines. \"Hon. Elizabeth Hacker and Hon. Mahlon Hanson submitted an article for publication with Law360 but withdrew the article upon learning of Law360's policy against the use of the term 'illegal' to refer to people,\" Fredenburgh said. \"We did not ban the judges from writing for Law360. In fact, we suggested ways the article could still be published while complying with our style. The judges' decision to withdraw the article from consideration with Law360 was theirs alone.\" The editorial board's style change -- and the reason for it -- did nothing to persuade the judges to resubmit their piece. \"I think it's basically a propaganda tool when The Associated Press is starting to tell reporters what term to use,\" Hanson said. \"It's really disappointing because they advertise themselves as a trusted legal resource,\" he said of the law publication. \"You know how definitions are important in court cases in using the precise legal terminology...I was surprised that they pushed it to that extent.\" In an Op-Ed published Thursday for FoxNews.com, Hacker and Hanson blamed the Obama administration and other factors for changing the terms of the illegal immigration debate to push an agenda. \"This administration, a compliant media and the 'political correctness' word police have taken control of the immigration debate with an agenda of deception, doublespeak and censorship.\" Of the term \"undocumented immigrant,\" Hacker and Hanson said it is \"factually incorrect because many of the aliens illegally present in this country have documents.\" \"These documents may range from those unlawfully obtained, like Social Security cards or Social Security numbers, fraudulent drivers licenses, or other documents legally obtained such as 'cedulas' or driver\u2019s licenses,\" they said. \"Also, the term 'immigrant' only applies to a person who has either legally entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident or has been adjusted to that status while in the United States.\" Click here to read the judges' Op-Ed.",

            "article_content": "First presidential votes counted as Election Day begins at midnight Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton started off neck-and-neck in the 2016 presidential election, as Trump won over the voters of three New Hampshire precincts early Tuesday morning, 32-25. Polls opened and shut quickly in the tiny hamlets of Dixville Notch, Hart\u2019s Location and Millsfield just after midnight Tuesday. Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. Clinton won more votes in Dixville Notch and Hart\u2019s Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield, with a 16-4 advantage. Libertarian Gary Johnson picked up three votes. Bernie Sanders, John Kasich and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got write-ins. The traditional early vote in New Hampshire kicked off what promises to be a busy election day, after Trump and Clinton visited key battleground states late Monday into early Tuesday to make one last plea to American voters. Speaking in Grand Rapids, Mich., Trump urged voters to ask themselves before they entered the voting booth: \u201cDo you want America to be ruled by the corrupt political class or do you want America to be ruled by the people?\u201d \u201cToday is our independence day, today the American working class is going to strike,\u201d he added. Clinton visited North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C. for a midnight rally. Clinton was led in by performances from Jon Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga and then by her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea. \u201cTomorrow night this election will end but I want you to understand that our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country.\u201d Clinton also made her final plea to middle class voters. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time, it\u2019s the kind of country we want, every issue so if you believe America thrives when middle class thrives then you have to vote, if you believe,\u201d she added. Clinton\u2019s speech in Raleigh echoed her entire trip Monday as she made her final campaign stops in key states. Clinton vowed to unite a divided nation. \u201cAnger is not a plan,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said in Pittsburgh, Pa. As Clinton spent the day blasting what she called her opponent\u2019s \u201cdivisive vision\u201d for America, Trump blamed her and her husband\u2019s policies for manufacturing job losses and vowed a change if he\u2019s elected. \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you. We\u2019re going to bring back wealth taken from this country,\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, said in battleground state North Carolina, the second of his five stops Monday. Trump began his day in Florida before heading to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He pulled out all the stops at the second to last rally of his campaign in Manchester, New Hampshire. Trump appeared with his running mate Mike Pence and many members of his family at the SNHU Arena, the same arena where he held his final rally before the New Hampshire primary. His win in that race paved his way to the party's nomination. \"It all began for me in New Hampshire,\" Trump said after taking the stage. The race remains tight hours before voting gets underway. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows Trump\u2019s prospects improving in four key states -- Arizona, Iowa, Utah and North Carolina \u2013 though Clinton still has the advantage on the electoral map. Clinton returned to the campaign trail Monday, less than 24 hours after the FBI concluded a revived probe into her personal email use as secretary of state, lifting a cloud off her campaign in the final hours as she seeks to become the first woman elected president in U.S. history. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time,\u201d Clinton said at her first rally, in Pittsburgh. \u201cWill we come together as a nation or split further apart? \u2026 We don\u2019t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive big-hearted America.\u201d Before embarking on her three-state campaign swing, Clinton told reporters that she has \"some work to do to bring the country together\" and that she wants to be president for those who vote for her and those who don't. Clinton after Pennsylvania went to battleground state Michigan before planning to return for an event in Philadelphia, then a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Trump on Monday resumed his breakneck race through the country to make a final appeal to voters to help him \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. In the wake of the FBI announcement, he urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box.\" On Sunday, Trump and running mate Mike Pence held events in seven states, with the last starting after midnight in Virginia. \u201cShe wants to fight ISIS?\u201d Trump said Monday in North Carolina about Clinton, who has essentially led for the entire 2016 election cycle. \u201cShe wants to fight nobody. She\u2019s got no chance.\u201d Trump is aiming for an upset victory Tuesday, which is still possible if he is able to win key toss-up states and pick off one or more strategic states considered Democratic territory. The former reality TV star shocked the country\u2019s political class this spring when he defeated 16 major candidates in the Republican primaries, among them several senators and governors. While seeking victories in the so-called battleground states, which have a mix of voters who could go for either major party candidate, Pennsylvania is considered critical for Trump. The state has not elected a GOP presidential nominee since 1988 in the candidates\u2019 race to get 270 Electoral College votes. Early voting in other battleground states suggests Clinton is leading among Hispanics, a key voting bloc. However, the African-American vote does not appear as strong for her as it was in 2008 and 2012 when black voters helped elect and re-elect Barack Obama. The Justice Department said Monday that it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That's a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago, amid Trump\u2019s persistent warning about potential voter fraud at polling stations. Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. The announcement also came amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.

(U.S. Customs and Border Protection) Texas authorities are on high alert after Border Patrol agents caught an alleged smuggler trying to disguise its SUV as one of the agency's vehicles, officials said Friday. Border Patrol agents caught a smuggler driving a Chevy Tahoe that was painted to look like one of the agency\u2019s vehicle, according to KRGV-TV. Vehicles are usually painted to act as delivery or telecommunications trucks to try and fool agents, but it\u2019s unusual to see a Border Patrol vehicle to be copied. Border Patrol in Laredo found 12 people stuffed in the back of the imposter vehicle. Agents knew the vehicle was a fake as soon as they found it. \u201cThere\u2019s no fender, there\u2019s no ground effect on any of our vehicles, Omar Zamora, an agent with the Border Patrol Rio Grande Valley sector, told KRGV-TV. \u201cThey\u2019re actually pretty bare and about as high as we get the vehicle, because we do go off road.\u201d Zamora said any agent would\u2019ve recognized the SUV. \u201cIn the 18 years that I\u2019ve been in the Border Patrol, we\u2019ve seen UPS, FedEx trucks, Time Warner trucks, any kind of clones. Any business you can think of. The smugglers are trying to clone it to avoid law enforcement detection,\u201d Zamora added. Zamora said the numbers and codes on each unit means something and was confident a clone couldn\u2019t conceal a crime in the region.

            "article_content": "SIERRA VISTA, AZ - OCTOBER 30:  The new MQ-9 Predator B, an unmanned surveillance aircraft system, unveiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), takes off at Libby Army Airfield at Ft. Huachuca October 30, 2006 in Sierra Vista, Arizona. CBP will use the new MQ-9 Predator aircraft to patrol the southern border of the United Sates in order to stop the illegal entry of thousands of Mexican nationals and drug runners who use the vast expanses of the Sonoran desert to cross into southern Arizona, daily. The new unarmed plane flew briefly for the press to show off its surveillance  capabilities by pilots of the contractor, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. Agents of CBP will start training on the use of the aircraft very soon. The Predator will start full scale flight operations along the Mexico-Arizona border today.  (Photo by Gary Williams/Getty Images) ((Photo by Gary Williams/Getty Images)) For nearly a decade, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has touted its drone program as an \u201ceffective technology to further enhance operational capabilities,\u201d but according to the agency\u2019s 2014 end of fiscal year report, the results are anything but impressive, fueling new calls for the program to be grounded. The program has a fleet of 9 Predator drones and the Department of Homeland Security is planning to spend another $443 million for more aircraft to help secure the Mexican border. But a Jan. 6 report from the agency's inspector general is advising against the expansion. \u201cNotwithstanding the significant investment, we see no evidence that the drones contribute to a more secure border, and there is no reason to invest additional taxpayer funds at this time,\u201d said DHS Inspector General John Roth. \u201cSecuring our borders is a crucial mission for CBP and DHS. CBP\u2019s drone program has so far fallen far short of being an asset to that effort.\u201d The IG report, the second audit of the program since 2012, found there is no reliable method of measuring the program's performance and determined that its impact in stemming illegal immigration has been minimal. According to the CBP Fiscal Year Report, the drones flew about 10 percent fewer hours in 2014 than the previous year and 20 percent fewer than in 2013. The missions were credited with contributing to the seizure of just under 1,000 pounds of cocaine in 2014, compared to 2,645 in 2013 and 3,900 in 2012. But apprehensions of illegal immigrants between 2014 and 2013 fell despite the flood of more than 60,000 unaccompanied children coming across the border from Central America. Combined with the decrease in productivity, the OIG report disclosed the staggering costs to run the program, more than $12,000 per hour when figuring fuel, salaries for operators, equipment and overhead. Eugene Schied, assistant commissioner of the CBP's office of administration for CBP, said the IG used flawed methods to draw its conclusions. \u201cThe expectations the OIG focused on were based on the program receiving resources that were not obtained, performance measures that were never employed by CBP, or technological capabilities that have been surpassed,\u201d Scheid said. \u201cThis context is critical for presenting an accurate assessment of the CBP UAS program\u2019s current performance and achievements.\u201d Scheid went on to say in his memo that CBP has no plans to acquire additional UAS beyond the one replacement aircraft, nor does the Office of Air and Marine have a contract or funding in place to expand the program. He said current funding is being used to expand the program\u2019s infrastructure and increase the utilization of the fleet. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) called for patience with the UAS program. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot cheaper to use drones than helicopters and they can stay in the air longer,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt still comes down to having the manpower on the ground to support the drone missions.\u201d Hunter said CBP needs to figure out what the need and use of the UAS is but marry that strategy with human resources on the ground. He made the correlation to the limitations other forms of border security technology such as sensors has in that unless there are agents who can respond quickly to the location, they do little good. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not sure CBP has the manpower to support the drone missions,\u201d Hunter said. What he did express concern over, also given the rise in unaccompanied children crossing the border this year was that, \u201cCBP isn\u2019t doing themselves any favor by flying less hours.\u201d",

Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time to (cough) focus on choking. And by that, I don\u2019t mean Hillary Clinton\u2019s coughing spell the other day, which sparked some of the old conspiracy chatter about her health (and #HackingHillary quickly became a top Twitter trend). And it led to these eight stacked headlines on the Drudge Report: 10 Doctors Question Hillary Health...  MSNBC Cuts Live Feed as She Sputters For Air... FIT LASTED OVER 4 MINUTES...  She slams 'conspiracy theories'... Media Blame Pollen...  Complete timeline of 2016 coughing fits... PRUDEN: Voters have right to ask... Thyroid problems linked to sudden cardiac death... Oh, and Donald Trump tried as well, tweeting: \u201cMainstream media never covered Hillary\u2019s massive 'hacking' or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What\u2019s up?\u201d (Trending topics are the new assignment editor!) Clinton, for her part, told reporters on her plane\u2014actually taking a number of questions from her press corps for the first time this year\u2014that she would not be distracted by rumors about her health. No, I\u2019m talking about choking as the term is used in sports: the 9th-inning strikeout, the dropped pass in the end zone, the clunker off the rim as time expires on the clock. The trash talk started with Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico. John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, ripped Trump for saying he and Enrique Pena Nieto did not discuss his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it,\u201d Podesta said. (The \u201clying\u201d allegation relates to Pena Nieto saying he had told Trump his country would never pay, but Trump may have been referring to his decision not to negotiate.) Trump fired back yesterday, using the same verb, on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d: \"So let me just tell you about choking. I don't choke. She chokes. Look at the deals she's made. She's responsible for so many bad things that have happened to our country, including the signing by her husband of NAFTA, which has drained our country of its jobs. I've been given A-plus, including by you people ... I have been given A-pluses for the job I did in Mexico.\u201d Now there\u2019s a serious issue beneath the locker-room jibes: Who can withstand the pressures of the presidency? It\u2019s reminiscent of the 3 a.m. phone call ad that Clinton ran against Barack Obama eight years ago. The charges and countercharges have been flying fast and furious in the last 48 hours. Clinton, on her plane\u2014and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s finally taking press questions\u2014said Trump must have something to hide in not releasing his tax returns. Trump said Monday that \u201cI think people don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think anybody cares, except some members of the press.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that every presidential nominee since Richard Nixon has released tax records. Clinton also said she must be creating jobs in the \u201cconspiracy theory machine factory.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, has been hammering away at questions surrounding the Clinton Foundation. In an echo of that earlier Hillary ad, his communications chief Jason Miller said: \u201cWhen that 3 a.m. phone call comes, we can\u2019t have an ethically-challenged president on the line who took truckloads of cash from other countries.\u201d And discussing Russia yesterday, Trump said: \u201cPutin looks at her and he laughs, OK? He laughs. Putin. Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles.\u201d The intensified pace comes as the media are gradually acknowledging that the polls are tightening. I wrote yesterday that the media narrative was lagging behind the surveys showing Trump closing the gap in national numbers. And yesterday, a new CNN poll gave Trump a 2-point lead over Clinton, or within the margin of error. No wonder the candidates are accusing each other of coughing, choking and caving in.",

(U.S. Customs and Border Patrol) The Land Rover Defender is one of the toughest vehicles ever built yet even it can\u2019t survive the crusher of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The example featured in the above video was seized at a Baltimore port back in April and sent to the crusher because it was imported illegally. The Defender is no longer offered for sale in the U.S. due to crash safety and emissions regulations, but older versions, at least 25 years of age, can be imported legally under classic car rules. Since the basic design of the Defender hasn\u2019t changed since the launch of the first version back in 1983, unscrupulous individuals have been buying more recent examples on the used market in the U.K. and modifying them to look like older series models. The vehicles are then imported to the U.S. under the classic car rules and sold to possibly unwary customers. Even the VINs are swapped for those from older models. Due to its rarity, prices for a Defender in the U.S. can reach as much as $100,000, according to Robert Hunt, a customs officer in Baltimore. In the U.K., used examples can be found for as little as $2,000. Original Mini Coopers have also been illegally imported using the same means. Hopefully Land Rover will hurry up and launch a new Defender in the U.S. since clearly there is considerable demand for the iconic nameplate. The last we heard, the new Defender\u2019s launch has been pushed back beyond 2015, the date when the current model will be phased out due to tougher emissions regulations.",

There\u2019s ongoing outrage over the fact that the administration put a Democratic partisan in charge of the investigation of partisan targeting at the Obama IRS. And that\u2019s just this week\u2019s news on Obama accountability. So given all that, and the scandals that came before, how likely are you to believe President Obama today when he says that internal measures will remedy problems with the domestic surveillance program that has blossomed on his watch? The president, dragging low job approval and weak measures on public trust in him and his administration, will announce that Attorney General Eric Holder and his team will get a handle on the spy game. That\u2019s going to be a tough sell. [According to documents provided by leaker Edward Snowden, The Guardian reports that \u201c[the NSA] has collected almost 200 million text messages a day from across the globe\u2026] The deets - In advance of the president\u2019s speech on NSA, the administration is pushing out early details to reporters. A senior administration official tells Fox News that Obama will say that he is ordering a transition that will end the \u201ctelephone metadata program\u201d as it currently exists, and move to a program that preserves the capabilities without the government holding the data. The official said Obama believes the program is important but can be preserved while addressing privacy and civil liberties concerns. From the talking points: -- Effective immediately, the administration will modify the program so that a judicial finding is required before querying the database. -- Obama has asked the attorney general and the intelligence community to report back to him before the program comes up for reauthorization on March 28 -- Obama will consult with the relevant committees in Congress to seek their views [Watch Fox: President Obama delivers remarks on the NSA in the 11 a.m. ET hour.] KELLY FILE: NOW YOU TELL US\u2026National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier told Megyn Kelly that President Obama \u201chas not earned our trust\u201d on domestic spying. \u201cFrom the beginning they haven\u2019t been very transparent about explaining what it is we\u2019re doing and why so we really have to be real careful, really look hard at what the president says...,\u201d Fournier said on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Watch the full interview here.

            "article_content": "Presidential candidate reportedly visiting Jordan amid debate over refugee policy; Reaction on 'America's Newsroom' Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson finished touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan Saturday and suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries. \u201cI did not detect any great desire for them to come to the United States,\" Carson told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Jordan. \"You've got these refugee camps that aren't completely full. And all you need is the resources to be able to run them. Why do you need to create something else?\" Carson toured the Azraq camp in northern Jordan under heavy Jordanian security. The tour was closed off to journalists. Carson\u2019s campaign also limited access, not providing his itinerary. Upon finishing his tour, Carson reiterated his opposition to allowing any Syrian refugees to come to the U.S., saying he didn\u2019t learn anything that gives him confidence in authorities\u2019 ability to screen potential terrorists. \"What I learned is that you're going to get a different answer from everybody depending on what their slant is,\" he said. \"I always oppose doing unnecessary things, particularly dangerous and costly unnecessary things.\u201d Carson also urged Americans to launch a \u201chumanitarian drive\u201d to raise billions of dollars that officials say is needed to improve the conditions for refugees settled across several countries in the Middle East. Carson told the Associated Press said all the refugees needed is \u201cadequate funding.\u201d \u201cThey were quite willing to stay there as long as it takes before they can get back home.\" Carson has often taken a harsh tone when discussing the refugee crisis, including how the U.S. handle resettling the refugees on American soil, amid concerns about terrorists foiling the vetting process. Last week, he likened blocking potential terrorists posing as Syrian refugees to handling a rabid dog. He also suggested Saturday that it would be best to absorb Syrian refugees in Middle Eastern host countries, which have given temporary shelter to most of the more than 4 million Syrians who have fled civil war in their country since 2011. In a separate statement, he described Syrians as \"as very hard working, determined people, which should only enhance the overall economic health of the neighboring Arab countries that accept and integrate them into the general population.\" And he broadened his call for financial support beyond Americans: \"The humanitarian crisis presented by the fleeing Syrian refugees can be addressed if the nations of the world with resources would provide financial and material support to the aforementioned countries as well as encouragement.\" More than 4 million Syrians fled their homeland since 2011, after a popular uprising erupted against President Bashar Assad and quickly turned into a devastating civil war. Most initially settled in neighboring countries, but conditions there have become increasingly difficult. Carson and his GOP rivals have criticized the administration\u2019s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees this budget year. The retired neurosurgeon has repeatedly struggled to discuss international affairs as they become a greater focus in the 2016 presidential contest. Those close to him concede his foreign policy fluency isn't yet where it needs to be. And they hope missions like this will help change that. \"I'd say he's 75 percent of the way there,\" Armstrong Williams, Carson's longtime business manager and closest confidant, said last week of the candidate's grasp of foreign policy. \"The world is a complex place, and he wants to get it right.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The two-term Republican state assemblywoman clarified statements she made Saturday on her Las Vegas-based radio talk show, \"Walk the Talk,\" that some interpreted as conflating refugees and terrorists and indicating she wanted to kill the whole group. \"I was not talking about the refugees,\" she told The Associated Press on Monday, but she added, \"I do not want Syrian refugees in our state, period.\" Fiore, who is known for making controversial statements and posing with guns in a custom calendar and on a family Christmas card, also confirmed that she's entering the race for Nevada's 3rd Congressional District and does not plan to seek re-election to her Las Vegas-area Assembly seat. She previously said she was exploring a congressional bid. Fiore's latest headline-grabbing comments involving guns came when she was asked why she didn't sign onto a letter from the Nevada Assembly Republican Caucus supporting a review of refugee resettlement programs. The lawmaker said she and some of the most conservative Assembly members weren't invited to sign the letter, which was issued after terrorist attacks in Paris, but remained opposed to accepting refugees. \"I'm about to fly to Paris and shoot 'em in the head myself,\" Fiore said on the show, which was broadcast on KDWN. \"I am not OK with Syrian refugees, I am not OK with terrorists. You know, I'm OK with putting them down, blacking them out, just put a piece of brass in their nocular cavity and end their miserable life. I'm good with that.\" Fiore said Monday that she didn't advocate killing refugees, but still wouldn't hesitate to shoot a terrorist if she needed to. She also said she can't trust the refugee vetting process to screen out terrorists, and warned that even women are carrying out attacks, as seen in the San Bernardino shootings.",

            "article_content": "GOP nominee explains his plans for vetting procedures America, we were introduced to our next president on Wednesday night. He\u2019s not a politician. He is one of a kind. He is an American. Welcome President Donald J. Trump. I\u2019m a cynical Jewish Ivy Leaguer from New York. Nothing gets me too excited. I don\u2019t believe politicians. Nor do I believe in politicians. I don\u2019t fall for theatrical political productions. I don\u2019t believe rhetoric or propaganda. And I\u2019ve never teared up over a political speech in my life. Until now. . . Wednesday night I found myself fist-pumping. I found myself chanting along with the crowd \u201cUSA, USA, USA.\u201d And as the procession of mothers and fathers came up to the podium to state the name of their child -- who was murdered by illegal immigrants -- and then say \u201cI\u2019m voting for Trump\u201d or \u201cTrump is our last chance to save America\u201d I found myself tearing up. And the amazing thing is\u2026 I\u00a0couldn't stop. The tears rolled down my face. This speech in Arizona was the game-changer. Not just the speech, but the entire day. Trump accepted the invitation to meet with the President of Mexico. He showed he\u2019s a man of action by flying to Mexico on a moment\u2019s notice. Trump stood next to Mexico's president -- looking to all the world like President Donald J. Trump. Trump stated his case and never gave an inch to the president of Mexico. Trump turned a vision -- that was mocked and ripped to shreds for a year now -- into a reality. Who now believes that if Trump is elected a wall won\u2019t be built? As a conservative, I\u2019ve waited a lifetime for this speech. Why? Because it was a speech that didn\u2019t back down by even one inch. It was a speech aimed at Americans, for Americans, delivered by a proud American, who values American exceptionalism. It was a speech that restores law and order. A speech that always put American citizens, workers and taxpayers first. A speech that recognized the right to safety and security for American citizens. A speech that recognizes that a foreigner here illegally does not have the same rights as an American-born citizen. A speech that pointed out that foreigners here illegally should not be treated better than our veterans. A speech that recognized that American citizens have every right to choose who comes into our country. And that we should proudly choose immigrants with skills, self-sufficiency and a respect for our common values. It was a speech that recognized that illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps and other entitlements -- and our government has a right, for the first time ever, to prioritize the deportation of illegal foreigners for abusing the welfare system. It was a speech that recognized that foreigners in American prisons for violent crimes and felonies should and will be deported immediately -- and that no country can refuse to take them back. It was a speech that recognized our right to practice \u201cextreme vetting\u201d on anyone who wants to come into America -- and that we can choose to exclude those who don\u2019t share or respect our values, customs, laws and Constitution. Some people just won\u2019t be allowed in. (At this point, I jumped up from my chair and screamed \u201cYES!\u201d) It was also a speech that recognized that the federal government must shut off all funding to Sanctuary cities.\u00a0After all that's our taxpayer\u00a0money being given to political leaders who are choosing to break the law. FINALLY, an adult has decided to just say \"NO.\" And then there\u2019s the wall\u2026 that great, big, beautiful Trumpian wall. I\u2019ve waited a lifetime to hear that we have a right to build a wall, to protect and secure our borders and keep the bad guys out. Trump covered it all on Wednesday night. He never backed down to pressure from the corrupt mainstream media, billionaire titans, Wall Street moguls, Silicon Valley tech gurus, lawyers, lobbyists, liberals, the GOP establishment, Ivy League know-it-all intellectuals. He gave no quarter to any of them. He changed nothing to appeal to them. I could feel their mouths dropping open in disbelief. Trump is our last chance to save America. To restore law and order. To protect my four beautiful children. To save our economy. To rescue our middle class. We have only one choice. We have only one chance. Look at yourself in the mirror. If you\u2019re American-born\u2026if you\u2019re a taxpayer\u2026if you\u2019re a parent\u2026if you love America\u2026if you agree this is the greatest country in world history\u2026.if you believe we are blessed by God\u2026if you\u2019re horrified at the prospect of bringing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into this country at a cost of $400 billion\u2026if you\u2019re scared to death about our soon-to-be-$20 trillion national debt\u2026if you don\u2019t want your child to become just another murder statistic\u2026if any of those descriptions fits you and Trump\u2019s speech didn\u2019t move you\u2026 You suffer from a mental disease called liberalism. If everything Trump promised and everything I\u2019ve just said doesn\u2019t impress you, then just think of Trump as our TREXIT. Trump is a blunt force, all-American, laser-guided middle finger to everything and everyone in Washington, D.C. And that, my fellow Americans, sounds like the dream of a lifetime to me.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2016, in Toledo, Ohio. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) Now that all of my inside-the-Beltway, elitist, morally superior friends and colleagues have weighed in with their self-righteous denunciations of Donald Trump, it\u2019s my turn. After initially opposing his candidacy for president, I have come around to another point of view. The election of Hillary Clinton will perpetuate and probably worsen everything many people hate about our bloated and dysfunctional government, collectively and derisively known as \u201cWashington.\u201d The election of Donald Trump will offer an opportunity \u2014 perhaps the last for decades \u2014 to \u201cfire\u201d or at least isolate the elites, returning the country to its constitutional boundaries. All analogies break down at some point, but let\u2019s engage in a theological stretch. When Jesus overturned the money changer\u2019s tables in the Temple, he said that instead of a house of prayer, the elites of his day had turned the Temple into \u201ca den of thieves.\u201d That increasingly applies to Washington. If Hillary Clinton wins in November, government will grow bigger and more expensive with all of her \u201cinvestment\u201d ideas, many of which have been tried before and failed. Remember the \u201cstimulus,\u201d which was targeted at infrastructure? Remember \u201cshovel-ready jobs,\u201d which were neither? Under President Hillary Clinton, what\u2019s to stop secular progressives from exacting revenge on churches and pastors who preach a different gospel than the one they favor? It has already started in Massachusetts with the transgender public accommodations bill, taking effect Oct. 1. The law allows transgender individuals to use public bathrooms that match their gender identities. It also protects them, writes the Boston Globe, \u201cfrom discrimination in public spaces such as museums, restaurants, malls, and libraries.\u201d And even churches, which may hold different views on the transgender issue, because they routinely hold events such as Bingo night, spaghetti dinners, book drives and charity car washes, all of which are open to the general public. The church hall can now be considered public space. Seventeen U.S. states have similar laws. If Hillary gets to appoint justices to the Supreme Court, will we be forced to accept more like this? Donald Trump is addressing the legitimate concerns of a large number of Americans who increasingly feel ignored by their government. These concerns include anemic economic growth. A growing economy produces private-sector jobs that create capital and wealth. These forgotten Americans are against open borders, which the president seemed to champion in his final speech to the United Nations General Assembly. Billionaire George Soros has pledged \u201cto invest up to $500 million in programs and companies benefiting migrants and refugees fleeing life-threatening situations.\u201d Many are tired of fighting wars we don\u2019t win and fighting terrorism with no clear strategy, all the while admitting more \u201crefugees\u201d from countries where terrorism is a way of death. They are weary of the denigration of law enforcement. Hardworking people are tired of being told they are not paying enough in taxes to a government that only wastes it. The ignored are tired of being branded racists. Christians are tired of being called homophobes and Islamophobes and told their beliefs are inferior to those who want to destroy the country and undermine values that were once widely held. If the secular progressive agenda is considered progress, as they claim, what would regress look like? Choosing a president is always a roll of the dice (to use a Trump casino metaphor). We know what we will get with Hillary Clinton, including corruption at the highest level. Those foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation will undoubtedly expect something in return. With Trump we don\u2019t know for sure what we\u2019ll get, beyond promises he has made and some contradictory positions he has taken. We can only hope that good people will serve and surround him, including running mate Mike Pence and the policy wonk Newt Gingrich. Only one candidate for president is capable of overturning the \u201cmoney changers\u201d in Washington. The political, governmental and media elites have had their chance to turn things around and they have failed. Now it\u2019s time for Trump. I just hope I don\u2019t have to eat my words.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) If you believe the pundits, Donald Trump is going to wage a one-man revolution if he loses the 2016 presidential election. That was the media\u2019s big takeaway from the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas between Trump and Hillary Clinton. At issue was a question posed by moderator Chris Wallace regarding whether Trump would accept the election results. \"I will tell you at the time,\" Trump replied. \"I'll keep you in suspense. OK?\" Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! The mainstream media went apoplectic. They want you\u00a0to believe that\u00a0Trump is going to gallop down 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on a white stallion leading a battalion of Minute Men armed with muskets and waving the Gadsden flag. The MSM is advancing this outrageous narrative to avoid covering legitimate scandals \u2013 like the James O\u2019Keefe videos exposing DNC thuggery and the WikiLeaks emails that reveal media collusion with the Clinton campaign. Hillary Clinton and her minions have attacked Catholics, Evangelicals, Republicans, Rednecks and Southern beauty queens as a bunch of irredeemable deplorable bigots. Her outright contempt for everyday Americans and our values should disqualify her from being the next leader of the free world. I have no doubt a Clinton presidency would soil the U.S. Constitution much like that DNC tour bus did on the streets of Lawrenceville, Georgia. So here are my top 10 takeaways: 1.\u00a0Mr. Trump needs to stay focused on the issues.\u00a0The American people don\u2019t care about the alleged sex scandal and I doubt they care about his remarks on whether he will concede the election if he loses. Voters do care about jobs, securing the border, protecting the Second Amendment and preventing radical leftists from commandeering the Supreme Court. The American people do not care about phony crises and scandals manufactured by Hillary Clinton\u2019s fanboys in the Mainstream Media. 2.\u00a0Unborn lives matter.\u00a0Christians who are still undecided about voting should reflect on Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s comments regarding late-term, partial birth abortions. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of a baby,\u201d Trump said. Clinton did not deny the charge. Instead, she called it \u201cscare rhetoric.\u201d 3.\u00a0Hillary's basket of dirty tricks.\u00a0Thanks to the fine undercover work of James O\u2019Keefe we know that the Democrats were allegedly involved in a dirty tricks campaign. They disrupted Trump campaign events \u2013 leaving innocent Americans bloodied and battered. WikiLeaks revealed that her campaign\u2019s goal was to portray Republicans as bigots and extremists. Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats must be held accountable. 4.\u00a0Add gun-toting toddlers to Hillary\u2019s \"basket of deplorables.\" Mrs. Clinton offered a bizarre theory for why she wants to crack down on the Second Amendment. \u201cDozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions,\u201d she said. 5.\u00a0Liberals accused me of being sexist. A motley crew of leftists slammed me on social media last night for calling the Democratic nominee \u201cMiss Hillary.\u201d Upon deep personal reflection, I\u2019d like to offer a public apology to\u00a0Mrs. Bill Clinton. 6.\u00a0Chris Wallace was the winner of last night\u2019s debate.\u00a0My colleague at Fox News delivered a fair and balanced debate to the nation. He kept the candidates and the crowd on point. It was a tremendous job. How refreshing to have a moderator instead of someone auditioning to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s press secretary. Well done, Mr. Wallace! 7.\u00a0The Case of the hanging chad.\u00a0The mainstream media are once again is predicting Trump\u2019s demise \u2013 they are furious over his refusal to say whether he will concede the election if he loses. CNN called it a death blow. One well-known pundit said it was political suicide. Mrs. Clinton said she was horrified. I wonder if she was horrified when Al Gore challenged the 2000 presidential election. The MSM seems to have come down with a sudden case of amnesia. 8.\u00a0It depends on what \"open borders\" means.\u00a0Clinton was asked to explain a quote from a speech divulged by WikiLeaks on her dream for \u201copen borders.\u201d She dodged the question. \u00a0But I\u2019ll be glad to answer for her. She wants to sacrifice American sovereignty. Under President Hillary Clinton \u2013 our nation will be overrun by illegals as well as Islamic radicals disguised as refugees. 9.\u00a0Mrs. Clinton should consider purchasing a lovely American flag pin.\u00a0It\u2019s a must-have, patriotic fashion accessory \u2013 especially for presidential candidates. And it goes well with anything \u2013 including pantsuits. 10.\u00a0Let\u2019s keep things in perspective.\u00a0No matter what happens on Election Day, remember that God is still in control \u2013 so let not your heart be troubled, America.",

Susana Martinez, a fellow Republican, and deflected a host of other complaints about Trump's presidential campaign, saying the real issues are jobs and the economy. \u201cThe governor is not doing the job,\u201d Lewandowski said about Martinez on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d in a sharp exchange with host Chris Wallace. \u201cLet\u2019s get it right. \u2026 This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democratic issue. We stand by our statement.\u201d Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, is being chastised by party leaders and others for attacking a Latino Republican governor, in her home state, particularly when Republicans sorely need the minority and female vote to win the general election. \"Your governor has got to do a better job,\" Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Albuquerque, hitting Martinez on high state unemployment and other issues. \"She's not doing the job. Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico. I'll get this place going.\" The remarks quelled speculation that Trump might pick Martinez, also chairman of the Republican Governors Association, as his running mate and brought to her defense such GOP leaders as House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Martinez endorsed for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Martinez's office responded by telling reporters in a statement: \"Apparently, Donald Trump doesn't realize Governor Martinez wasn't elected in 2000, that she has fought for welfare reform, and has strongly opposed the president's Syrian refugee plan.\" Lewandowski on Sunday argued the real issues are jobs, the economy and immigration. \u201cWe need to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to put people back to work, cut taxes. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d Lewandowski also argued his purported disputes with fellow top campaign adviser Paul Manafort are media hype, saying they speak several times daily and work together on key decisions. He also defended Trump\u2019s decision not to debate Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, suggesting the billionaire businessman was joking when he brought up the idea. Lewandowski said the campaign is \u201csolely focused\u201d on beating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to waste our time debating Bernie Sanders when he\u2019s not going to be the nominee,\u201d he said. Sanders said Friday night on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d that he would still \u201clove\u201d to debate Trump and essentially asked him to reconsider. \u201cTrump claims to be a real tough guy, pushes people around. Hey Donald, come on up and let's debate about the future of America,\" Sanders said. Lewandowski also defended against criticism that the campaign staff is too small to win a general election against one as deep and far-reaching as Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been leaner with better results,\u201d said Lewandowski, arguing the campaign won\u2019t have 700 or 800 people, like Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe spent less money, got better results.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

My wife and mother-in-law both have Master\u2019s Degrees; my daughter and sister are both lawyers; one niece is a Yale Law school graduate who now prosecutes crimes in Washington, D.C.; another niece is a medical doctor; and my sister-in-law helped to run a winning state campaign to help elect President Obama. The positions that these women now occupy would have been impossible without Elizabeth Cady Stanton, early pioneer for women\u2019s rights who helped compose the 1848 Declaration of Sentiments. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to get so far if it weren\u2019t for Carrie Chapman Catt, who headed the fight for the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. And, in particular, it would be impossible without Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d got women to fight against their limited roles as housewives and mothers. It is the result of these and countless other pioneering women, who inspired women to go to work and marry later so that they could build careers first. It is the reason they fought for the right to control their own healt That has had a tremendous impact on family life, with fewer marriages taking place, more children born to single women and more poverty for those children. Women also now make up the majority of college and graduate school students, three members of the Supreme Court, 20 percent of the Senate and a record 87 members of the House. And it is the reason why women now make up almost half of the work force. It is the reason why it is so outdated to judge women by their appearance as opposed to their intellect and character. DP: On a whole, would you say that the Constitution has held up since the nation\u2019s founding? JW: I do \u2013 it is an incredible achievement for anything to last close to 230 years. When a framework for government can withstand civil war and world wars it stands as an incredible achievement. When you look past all the noise of politics, past the current presidential race and its 24-hour news coverage, you\u2019ll find a government that still operates by the guidelines set forth in the Constitution. You\u2019ll see a legislature that makes laws, a judiciary that interprets them, and a president that enforces them. You\u2019ll see separation of powers, checks and balances: a president that can veto a bill, but a Congress that can override the veto; a president that can lead the nation, but a Congress that can still impeach him; a president that can appoint a Supreme Court Justice, but a Congress that can turn down his appointment. So, even as we decry all the excesses and distraction of modern political culture, we need to remember that the building blocks of contemporary government \u2013 things we still do \u2013 are all written, right there, in the Constitution. Yet in some ways the Constitution has not stood the test of time. And that\u2019s a good thing. The men who wrote the Constitution would never have understood something like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the Voting Rights Act of the following year. In their day blacks were three-fifths of a person. They did not fight to end slavery. And they allowed the slave trade to continue for 20 more years. It was Thurgood Marshall who once called the Constitution \u201cdefective from the start.\u201d So, in part, it is a good thing that the Constitution included the ability to be amended. When the 55 delegates were gathered in 1787 to write the Constitution, they didn\u2019t make their debates open to the public. They wanted to be able to disagree candidly, without the fear that their words would be used against them. They wanted to disagree, which they did\u2014a whole lot \u2013 before reaching compromise. That was the spirit in which the Constitution was written. So, the fact that we\u2019re still fighting may prove just how constitutional America still is. DP: What is the next big change and who might lead it? JW: Option 1: As a black man, one of the most emotional parts of the book to write was the chapter on race. The rapid increase in racial minorities in the USA and immigrants is changing the national character. It is no longer solely focused on black disadvantage and white responsibility for slavery. The conversation is far more nuanced with the problems of racial inequity often focused on the black poor and their mistreatment by the police. But there is a bigger story about race emerging. In the book I focused on two figures \u2013 Martin Luther King and Jesse Jackson \u2013 who defined the race question of their era. For King in the mid-20th century, it was a question of black citizenship: earning the right to vote and enter white-owned establishments. For Jackson, in the late 20th century, it was a question of black capitalism: better jobs, better pay, and more\u00a0 political power to demand equity. But what issue defines the race question today? I think it comes down to education and ending the achievement gap between black and white students. Incidentally, it was while I was editing \u201cWe The People\u201d that Donald Trump called for a wall between the United States and Mexico and claimed Mexico was sending thugs, rapists, and drug dealers to the United States: inflammatory remarks that has made immigration reform a key talking point in the 2016 election season. I thought about my chapter on the Kennedy Brothers \u2013 John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy \u2013 whose Irish heritage inspired them to lobby for immigration reform, leading to the passage of the 1965 Hart-Celler Act. They did this by assuring Congress that immigration reform was in keeping with America\u2019s best principles: that we\u2019d always been a \u201cNation of Immigrants.\u201d Based on the amount of time politicians have spent on immigration during the election season, I think one major change -- fast approaching -- will involve immigration reform. It will come from someone who can find a way to provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently on our shore, while ensuring Republicans that the border will become secure. And it will come from someone who can convince America that immigration reform is in keeping with America\u2019s best principles of inclusivity. Perhaps it will be someone like Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force and longtime advocate for immigration reform who authored the Immigrant Children\u2019s Educational Advantage and Dropout Prevention Act in 2001 (never went to a vote), a precursor to the DREAM Act. Or maybe the current meltdown of the Right (caused by Cruz and Trump) will allow the moderate Republican voices on immigration to take control of the immigration question. Maybe it will be someone like Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a Republican of Cuban heritage and an important advocate for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. \u00a0Or maybe someone like Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a former member of the Gang of Eight who has also argued for a pathway to citizenship. DP: As a journalist, if you could go back, what would you have liked to ask the Founding Fathers? JW: Question for the Founders in General: How long do you think this republic will last? According to Yale historian Joanne Freeman, Americans well into the 1790s made offhand comments in their letters to one another like: \u201cIf this government lasts more than five years, here\u2019s what I think we should do.\u201d So I would ask them how much faith they had in the government that they were making. How long would it last? What would have to happen in order for it to last? Were they ever suspicious that it would fail as soon as it began? Who\u2019d be responsible for the failure? Some Questions for George Washington: Many believed that George would remain president until he died. But he did not. By stepping down from the presidency in 1796, Washington set the two-term precedent. He said he was tired and worn down by the job. His decision to turn down a third term has also been read in symbolic terms; the US is a democracy with presidents, not a monarchy with Kings. Mr. President, off the record, why didn\u2019t you take a third term? What were the competing interests? According to historian Ron Chernow you \u201chad always planned to remain as president only until the new Constitution had taken root.\u201d (Ron Chernow\u2019s words) But did you ever hesitate? Did the prospect of a third term ever seem appealing? Some questions for the loyalists: We tend to forget that not every colonist wanted to rebel against the mother country. But not every American Colonist was so set on starting a revolution. Some were loyalists. In fact, 15 to 20 percent of white male colonists during the Revolution remained loyal to the crown. Another large percent just didn\u2019t want anything to do with the war. Loyalists were not all stuffy aristocrats. Some were regular old farmers. I\u2019d want to talk to them. I\u2019d ask them what they thought about the patriots? What did they think about the Crown? What was their reasoning for not joining the cause? DP: All the changes that the US has been through can lead us to new beginnings. On the other hand, Trump is talking about returning to something that we\u2019ve lost. Is there some leader that can unite the people who want to go back and the people who want a new start? JW: That\u2019s a difficult question. But here are some ideas: Someone in the Tech Industry: So I didn\u2019t cover this in the book, but when I think about the companies you hear most about today, and when I think about millennials, I realize that it\u2019s all about tech. People like Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, Sergey Brin, cofounder of Google, Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, and Kevin Systrom, founder of Instagram. Everyone respects the work that these tech hotshots have done: no matter your political persuasion. They\u2019ve been able to tap into America\u2019s long history of capitalist innovation, as well move America into the future technologically, radically changing the way we communicate, hold campaigns, and run government. Some of them are huge philanthropists. Some, like Zuckerberg, have been active in, among other areas, education reform and disease research. I wonder whether any of these or other tech figures will enter politics in earnest.",

            "article_content": "Senior adviser Barry Bennett talks trading hits with Hillary Clinton over Orlando attack While investigators try to piece together what led the Orlando gunman to carry out an unspeakable act of terror, the attack is upending the 2016 campaign debate as the two presumptive rivals go toe-to-toe on terror with two very different messages. In back-to-back speeches Monday, Donald Trump doubled down on his call for a Muslim immigration ban while decrying what he described as a \"deadly ignorance\" that is hurting the country -- and Hillary Clinton renewed her call for an assault-weapons ban while vowing to stop \"lone wolf\" terrorists. Trump, speaking in New Hampshire, focused largely on his plans for an immigration crackdown. Trump said he wants to \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism\" against the U.S. or its allies. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d Trump said of the proposed ban.\u00a0It wasn't immediately clear whether Trump was revising his long-standing proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims entering the U.S., which he also defended, or referring to the same plan. The New York businessman also called the Orlando shooting \u201can assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.\u201d \u201cIt we don\u2019t get tough, and we don\u2019t get smart \u2013 and fast \u2013 we\u2019re not going to have a country anymore \u2013 there will be nothing left,\u201d Trump said. Trump, speaking at St. Anselm College, was quick to slam his Democratic rival, claiming she \u201cis in total denial\u201d and that her ultimate plan is to \u201cdisarm law-abiding Americans\u201d while admitting immigrants who could pose a threat. A few hours earlier at her speech in Ohio, Clinton called for an \"intelligence surge\" and a ban on assault weapons as part of a multi-pronged strategy to confront homegrown terrorism. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, following the Orlando terror attack, called on Americans to fight terrorism at home with \u201cclear eyes\u201d and \u201csteady hands.\u201d She delivered a carefully calibrated message, calling for America to get tougher on terrorists while also renewing gun control proposals that have failed to gain steam in Congress. At the Cleveland campaign event, she drew cheers from the crowd after calling for a ban on assault weapons. \u201cWeapons of war have no place on our streets,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton also said if she were in the White House, a top priority would be \u201cidentifying and stopping lone wolves,\u201d like the Orlando shooter. She also called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State messages from the Internet and said \u201cpeace-loving Muslims are in the best position to help fight radicalization.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech was originally supposed to focus on his case against the Clintons \u2013 but Trump changed his focus following the attack in Orlando that left 49 people dead and dozens injured. The gunman died in a shootout with police. On Monday, President Obama said investigators believe the gunman was not directed by external extremist groups, instead saying the shooter \u201cwas inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the Internet.\u201d He added that there is \u201cno direct evidence\u201d the shooter \u201cwas part of a larger plot.\u201d Clinton warned earlier Monday against demonizing an entire religion, saying doing so would play into the hands of the Islamic State group. \"We can call it radical jihadism, we can call it radical Islamism,\" Clinton said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American-Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion.\" The horrific shooting consumed the White House race just as Trump and Clinton were fully plunging into the general election. It served as a reminder to the candidates and voters alike that the next president will lead a nation facing unresolved questions about how to handle threats that can feel both foreign and all too familiar. Trump said Monday he was revoking the press credentials of the Washington Post after the newspaper published an article with a headline \"Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting.\" \"Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post,\" Trump posted on his Facebook page. Authorities identified the killer in Orlando as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American-born Muslim. FBI officials said they had investigated him in 2013 and 2014 on suspicion of terrorist sympathies but could not make a case against him. Mateen opened fire at the Pulse Orlando club with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He called 911 during the attack to profess his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist organization though it was unclear whether he had any direct contact with ISIS or was just inspired by them. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "This 2007 photo provided by Chase Millsap shows Millsap with the Captain standing next to a suspected truck bomb following a successful raid in Al Anbar, Iraq. (Chase Millsap via AP) After three military combat tours in war-torn Iraq, Chase Millsap returned home to get on with a civilian life. But there was one thing he couldn't do: leave a comrade behind, certainly not one who had saved his life. Especially not the former Iraqi military officer who had worked with the Americans and was now living a precarious existence as a refugee dodging Islamic State militants seeking to kill him. For the past two years, Millsap has been fighting a different kind of battle, one to gain asylum for the brother in arms he simply calls The Captain. \"The Captain is the epitome of my personal commitment to take care of people,\" said Millsap, 33, who served in the Marine Corps and later joined the Army and became a Green Beret. For the time being, The Captain lives in southern Turkey, struggling to obtain refugee status in what he hopes will be the first step toward seeking permanent asylum in the United States. \"If I go back, I'm sure I die,\" the 37-old Muslim and married father of two said recently during an interview over Skype. He agreed to speak, but, fearing for his safety, only wanted to be identified by his former rank. As he spoke, his 3-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son played in the family's living room. Millsap visited his friend last year at his cramped apartment, hoping he might help him expedite his refugee application. After running into one obstacle after another \u2014 The Captain couldn't get an interview at one government office because his papers were in English, not Turkish \u2014 Millsap returned to the United States and formed the nonprofit Ronin Refugee Project with a handful of other military veterans. It's dedicated to helping those who fought alongside Americans find safe harbor here or in other Western countries. After helping The Captain, they hope to turn their attention to others. \"He's one of millions that's stuck in a system that is broken and he's just gonna continue to wait,\" Millsap said. \"And so we decided to step up, me and a few other veterans.\" He will be in Washington on Tuesday to meet with members of Congress and others to discuss just how the U.S. might go about doing that. \"That's really become my mission,\" said the newlywed who obtained his master's degree from the University of Southern California and then went to work this month as a community liaison helping U.S. veterans reintegrate into civilian life. Friendly and outgoing, Mills was a fresh-faced second lieutenant when he arrived in Iraq in 2006 to lead a contingent of U.S. Marines and Iraqi soldiers. The Captain, a lieutenant himself then, was among the latter group. \"When I met The Captain, I was unimpressed at first,\" Millsap said, chuckling now. He was a Marine, after all, he is quick to add, and no decent Marine thinks anyone can do the job better than he can. Never mind that they were in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by danger in a foreign country where they didn't know the culture. His attitude began to change as The Captain patiently explained why he and his troops weren't getting buy-in from the locals or the Iraqi soldiers. It changed dramatically, however, after a sniper tried to take Millsap's head off during a routine patrol. \"He quickly pushed me down and ran towards the gunfire and because of that, saved my life,\" Millsap recalled. The sniper, seeing an angry Iraqi soldier charging at him, chose to run rather than shoot again. \"And that,\" Millsap added with a laugh, \"is when I truly realized that this guy's OK.\" It was a coincidence that the two crossed paths a year later during Millsap's second tour. He was again in charge of a Marine contingent, and The Captain was now his Iraqi counterpart. The bearded soldier stared at him, incredulous that he'd returned to that hell. Millsap left the Marines after that tour to join the Army's Green Berets, rising to the rank of captain himself. The two didn't cross paths but kept in touch by phone and email \u2014 until one day, the communications stopped. The Captain, Millsap would learn a year later, had nearly been killed when an improved explosive device blew up his Jeep. He recovered and soldiered on until the Islamic State group began moving in and the death threats began. When calls to his home began identifying his children by name, he gathered up his family and fled to Turkey. Now, a typical day begins with physical therapy on his right arm, still damaged by the IED. That's followed by tasks like teaching his children the English alphabet, then studying English grammar himself so he can fine-tune his United Nations application for refugee status. The last time he met with a U.N. official, he said, he was told a decision might come within three months. That was four months ago. Now he's heard maybe in a month or two. Or maybe a year. He and Millsap check in by Skype once a week. During a recent call, he praised Ronin Refugee Project for not forgetting him. \"I feel like you are my family. You are my brother. You and the other group of Marines are really gentlemen,\" he said before his voice began to break.",

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Lafayette Park President Obama launched into his second term with a sharply worded inaugural address Monday -- using the platform to \"reject\" steep cuts to entitlements, press for an immigration reform package and wag the finger at Washington's penchant for \"name-calling\" and \"spectacle.\" Hours later, the president took the traditional ride down Pennsylvania Avenue back to the White House. As he did four years ago, he and first lady Michelle Obama exited the limo and walked the final stretch, waving to the crowd as they went. Obama's 20-minute inaugural address, delivered to a packed crowd on the National Mall right after he took the oath of office, effectively set the tone for the next four years. After a rocky four years marked by bitter battles between the White House and Republicans in Congress, Obama made clear he would continue to press those lawmakers to move toward him on some of the toughest policy questions ahead. The president quickly toggled through a host of agenda items, but used some of his most forceful language to defend costly entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that could be the target of cuts in upcoming fiscal talks. Declaring that the country cannot succeed \"when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,\" he described those programs as a vital safety net -- though, without some intervention, budget forecasters warn they will not be sustainable in the long term. Check out FoxNews.com's full coverage of Inauguration 2013 \"We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future,\" Obama said. \"The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\" While setting his terms for looming budget fights, the president also worked in a call for immigration reform. \"Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country,\" he said. Further outlining his goals for a second term, he said the administration would \"respond to the threat of climate change.\" The president, in closing, appeared to chide the minority party, saying: \"We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.\" At the same time, he urged the country to set aside differences and work together toward addressing challenges ranging from the country's tax code to its education system. \"Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation, and one people,\" Obama said, on the west front of the Capitol. \"My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.\" Obama, over the course of the speech, appeared to offer a series of assurances to his supporters that he would continue to fight for the issues he campaigned on. However, while Obama was buoyed by his decisive win over Mitt Romney in November, he nevertheless enters the second term facing a packed agenda and a divided Congress he'll have to win over if he wants to get it passed. For the president, the second term essentially began after Election Day, when he started negotiating with congressional Republicans on the fiscal crisis. However, it took a tragic yet pivotal turn Dec. 14 when a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school. Obama, within days, vowed to find at least some measure to curb gun violence. And last week, the 44th president announced the details of his plan, which includes an assault-weapons ban, limiting magazines to 10 rounds, background checks for prospective buyers and extending mental health treatment to young Americans. His near-term legislative agenda will encompass both the gun-control issue as well as renewed talks with House Republicans over three pressing fiscal matters: the debt ceiling, massive cuts to federal spending and a budget resolution. With all of those challenges, though, Obama faces the task of bridging the divide with Congress. Partisan lines, as a result of the November elections, appeared only to harden, with Democrats locking down control of the Senate and Republicans doing likewise in the House. Washington was able to craft a last-minute deal to avert the fiscal crisis at the start of 2013, but the deal merely kicked off the big decisions -- on entitlements, on tax reform -- for another day. In the first year of Obama's second term, it should be clear whether Washington will start to make those decisions, or continue to punt. More immediately, Obama has stated that Congress must increase the debt ceiling to keep the country from defaulting on its bills and that he will not negotiate on the issue. However, the White House has already put Congress on notice that budget talks could be delayed because Obama will miss the legal Feb. 14 deadline to submit his plan. Despite having to deal with those issues right away, Obama appears committed to addressing immigration reform in the early months, purportedly in a one-step, comprehensive package. Still, the expected partisan wrangling must wait until after Monday. The inauguration ceremonies were not so cloaked in history as in 2009, when Obama became the nation's first black president before a crowd of 1.8 million. Officials expect up to 700,000 to attend Monday's ceremonies, a day-long gala throughout the District that includes the traditional inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. The president and his family started the day with services at St. John's Episcopal Church near the White House. The president and the first lady will close out the day's festivities with two official inaugural balls Monday night. Obama was sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts on two Bibles: one belonging to President Lincoln and the other from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The invocation was given by Myrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Among those performing in the roughly three-hour event were James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonc\u00e9, who sang the national anthem. The Rev. Luis Le\u00f3n delivered the benediction. In his address, the president who was the first in history to endorse gay marriage also included a reference to the cause of gay rights. \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,\" he said. Come Tuesday, the president returns to work trying to build on a first term which was largely defined by him getting Congress to pass the comprehensive health-care overhaul that he signed into law in 2010 and ending the hunt in 2011 for 9/11 terrorist Usama bin Laden. He notched other major accomplishments, some more controversial than others. He signed the law repealing the 1990s-era \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, in turn allowing for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U.S. military. He also signed into law the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid the worst recession since the Great Depression. More recently, Obama suspended deportation for younger illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents.",

A recent New York Times headline: \u201cPeter Thiel Defends His Most Contrarian Move Yet: Supporting Trump.\u201d Isn\u2019t it time people started defending their support for Hillary Clinton? Why aren\u2019t Hillary\u2019s backers made to explain how they can vote for a candidate who promised not to trade access for money while she served as Secretary of State, but then did it anyway? Who vowed to reveal all monies collected by the Clinton Foundation from foreign entities while she was in office but failed to do so? AN \"AVALANCHE OF EVIDENCE\" MAY NOW BURY HILLARY Who has lied innumerable times to the American people and who has time and again revealed herself as lacking a moral compass?

Whose natural instincts are to lie, about matters serious and inconsequential? Whose greed outweighs incandescent ambition? Who offers voters nothing but enraged disparagement of her opponent? It\u2019s a reasonable question that should be asked: how can anyone with good conscience vote for Hillary Clinton?

He has come under withering criticism from Silicon Valley elites, followed by \u201cdemands that Facebook drop him from its board of directors and that Silicon Valley\u2019s leading start-up incubator, Y Combinator, sever ties with him.\u201d This, for supporting the standard-bearer of one of America\u2019s main political parties; a candidate who has a real shot at winning. The shunning comes from those accusing Thiel of condoning \u201cracism and intolerance\u201d, says the Times, an organization that seems to being doing its best to further such associations. Indeed, the liberal media, exposed through numerous leaked emails as colluding with the Hillary Clinton campaign, has done a terrific job of turning Trump backers into pariahs. But shouldn\u2019t we question those who are putting their money behind Hilary Clinton, the first person to run for the presidency while subject of a criminal investigation? Whose natural instincts are to lie, about matters serious and inconsequential? Whose greed outweighs incandescent ambition? Despite decades of scandal, Wall Street tycoons and Hollywood eminences gather to promote the Good Ship Hillary, happy to sail with the progressive tides. Even as cranky investigators expose icebergs in their path. And no one calls them to account. Many take solace in following President Obama, who has not stinted in his efforts to elect Clinton. Obama, who remains popular with those who absolve him of his lies about the Iran deal, ObamaCare, Benghazi, and now about his professed ignorance of the Clinton private server, is out campaigning for Hillary, whom he has repeatedly called \u201cthe most qualified candidate in history.\u201d He does not call her the most trustworthy, or the most genuine, or respectable or moral; the man is not a total idiot. He describes her as tough and says she has tenacity. That we know. Obama isn\u2019t campaigning for Hillary Clinton because he likes her; he\u2019s out there hustling for votes because if Donald Trump is elected, Obama\u2019s cherished legacy will melt away faster than ice cream in August. ObamaCare? Gone. Amnesty for undocumented immigrants? Gone. Overreaching EPA rules that will set our power costs soaring? Done for. The Iran deal? Well, chances are that collapses regardless of who succeeds him. Obama knows that Hillary is the protector of the status quo and of his legacy. He also knows she cannot be trusted. When she joined his cabinet, Hillary was required to sign an agreement aimed at minimizing her pay-to-play opportunities while she served at the State Department. She vowed that she would not personally participate in any matter that could impact the finances of the Clinton Foundation or the earnings of her husband, Bill. In a separate agreement, she agreed to reveal all foreign donations to the foundation. We know she broke these promises. In just one of many such examples, after Hillary intervened to solve a tax problem for Swiss banking giant UBS (an unusual gig for Secretary of State), the bank paid husband Bill $1.5 million in speaking fees and donated generously to the foundation. Even more alarming, there were\u00a01,100 foreign donations funneled through the Clinton Foundation\u2019s Canadian affiliate that were received while Clinton was in office\u00a0but never reported. Clinton\u2019s memorandum of understanding with the Obama White House specifies that the \u201cClinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative\u201d (the Canadian branch) is part of the Clinton Foundation and must follow \u201cthe same protocols.\u201d It did not. The estimated net worth of Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2006 was $34 million. In 2015, it was $111 million. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hillary did not rack up such wealth. After all, during her four years as Secretary of State her salary was only $186,000. Filings suggest her net worth in 2006 was about $30 million; in 2015, it was nearly unchanged at $31 million.\u00a0 In 2006 Bill\u2019s wealth was about $4 million; by 2015 that had soared to $80 million. Note that during those years the U.S. financial markets endured one of the worst downdrafts ever, which lopped off a sizeable slug of the country\u2019s wealth. By 2015 financial markets had recovered, but it is safe to conclude that Bill Clinton\u2019s good fortune did not come by way of investment returns. No, Bill made a fortune giving speeches, often to groups also funding the Clinton Foundation, and who had business before the U.S. government. It was a seamy arrangement \u2013 seamy enough to apparently invite scrutiny from FBI agents who were then blocked from pursuing an investigation. Donald Trump is no Boy Scout. His business history is checkered and his personal manner is off-putting. But, the portrayal of him as racist and dangerous has been overblown by Hillary\u2019s team, because they have nothing else to talk about. Hillary fears the appeal of a fresh-start candidate, and especially one who is willing to challenge the status quo and push back at the politically correct idiocy ensnaring our national discourse. Trump is offering voters a real choice, which doesn\u2019t happen often. President Obama campaigned on hope and change, but delivered neither. It is possible \u2013 likely, even \u2013 that it will take an outsider to shift the direction of the country, to upend the corrupt politics of Washington, to stem the unbridled expansion of the federal government and return power to the people, which most Americans seem to want. That outsider, in this cycle, is Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "DeKelaita, shown here in his homeland of Iraq, claims he ran afoul of the Departmennt of Justice when he complained about the treatment of Christian asylum seekers. In the Iraqi-American Christian community, he is revered as an activist who delivered thousands from persecution at the hands of Muslim extremists, but in the U.S. halls of justice, Robert DeKelaita is regarded as a criminal who helped clients lie to get asylum. The 53-year-old, Iraq-born DeKelaita, who was convicted earlier this month of helping clients falsify asylum applications, faces up to 35 years in prison when he is sentenced in August. DeKelaita\u2019s supporters insist he was targeted for speaking out about what they consider the federal government\u2019s blind eye to Christian persecution in the Middle East. \u201cWe are infuriated that one of our leaders was targeted for helping people escape the horrors of Iraq and Syria,\u201d said Ramon Michael, a board member of the nonprofit Assyria Foundation. \u201cThe Assyrian community worldwide has been watching this case. What do you think our opinion of the U.S. government will be if they insist on ruining a man who has earned the utmost respect and gratitude of his people worldwide?\u201d DeKelaita told FoxNews.com he has helped approximately 4,000 Muslims and Christians emigrate to the U.S. in a near-20-year career, but that he focused his Chicago-based practice on Assyrians, the name for Christians in Iraq and Syria, a decade ago, amid their growing persecution by Muslim extremists. DeKelaita, (l.), in a meeting with Archbishop of Erbil Bashar Matte Warda, (c.), to discuss the plight of Iraq's Christian community. \u201cThe decline of the Christian community is something that didn\u2019t only start in 2003,\u201d DeKelaita, who was born in Kirkuk and came to the U.S. as an 11-year-old, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThis annoyed a lot of judges, a lot of people. But I refused to ever give up on cases because I understood what was going on in Iraq, unlike a lot of officials who only went by policy.\u201d DeKelaita claims the government got a handful of his former clients to testify that he helped them make up stories about persecution and falsified documents that helped them win asylum in the U.S. The federal jury who heard testimony in the three-week trial convicted DeKelaita on one count of conspiracy to commit asylum fraud, two counts of knowingly offering false statements in an asylum application and one count of procuring perjury during asylum documents. \u201cEvidence at trial revealed that from approximately 2000 to 2011, DeKelaita prepared and submitted asylum applications that contained material lies, including tales of rape, murder, torture, kidnappings, bombings and other forms of religious oppression in the Middle East,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Zachary Fardon said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, several of DeKelaita\u2019s clients were granted asylum and eventually permanent residency and citizenship status. The federal government provides asylum to immigrants who can demonstrate that they were targeted \u2013 or have a legitimate fear of being targeted \u2013 in their homeland for religious, racial, political or ethnic reasons. Prosecutors claim DeKelaita, who employed a translator who also was charged, \u201ccoached\u201d clients and encouraged them to lie to the asylum officers who decided their fate. The case was based on the testimony of nine Iraqi Christians DeKelaita helped from 2000 to 2011. He claims they were pressured into testifying against him out of fear they would be deported. DeKelaita traces the case against him to complaints he lodged in Detroit, where he criticized immigration officials for favoring Muslim applicants at the expense of Christians. \u201cIt should make anyone pause as to why all of the [government witnesses] were Iraqi Christians,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd why all of them are from Detroit. \u201cIt should make any attorney very afraid that the government can go back to a client from 15 years ago and coerce them,\u201d he said. Although DeKelaita\u2019s crimes date back more than a decade, the investigation began in 2008 and intensified even as persecution against Iraqi Christians increased dramatically under the rising Islamic State. \u00a0His office in the Windy City suburb of Morton Grove was raided in September 2014, as ISIS was carving out a massive caliphate in northern Iraq and Syria. Less than two years later, the U.S. State Department would acknowledge that Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq faced genocide in their homeland. An estimated 1.5 million Christians lived in Iraq in 2003, but the number is estimated to have dwindled below 200,000 today. \u201cFor many, Robert was the light at the end of a dark tunnel,\u201d said Ramsin Benjamin, executive director of the Assyrian American Chamber of Commerce. \u201cHe fought valiantly and advocated for the Assyrian community both in and outside of the courtroom. \u201cTo pick on a group like Assyrian Christians that have not committed any acts of terror \u2013 but for the most part are rather law-abiding, peaceful contributors to American society \u2013 is absurd.\u201d Wendy Patrick, a California-based attorney and ethics lecturer at San Diego State University, said accusations of exaggeration or lying on asylum applications are a serious matter when it comes to both national security and assessing applications of those seeking genuine refuge. Those who commit fraud can have a chilling effect on legitimate seekers, she said. \"Within the current climate of elevated terrorist threat levels and public safety concerns, one possible result of the conviction might be an increased skepticism of individuals who are genuinely seeking asylum,\u201d she said. DeKelaita is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 3, and faces a theoretical maximum of 35 years in prison. Supporters of DeKelaita, who attended University of Illinois, University of Chicago and Loyola University School of Law, have set up a website to support him and raise funds for his legal defense. \u00a0He is considering an appeal, and insists he would do nothing differently if he could start over. \u201cI did the best I could for these people,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew what they experienced was bad and I take pride in being able to help anyone \u2013 any religion \u2013 who is being persecuted.\u201d",

The National September 11 Memorial and Museum will be closed to the public during the September 11 commemoration ceremony and much of the rest of the day, but it will be open from 6 p.m. to midnight for anyone who wants a close up view of the Tribute in Light. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (The Associated Press) Fifteen years after the worst terrorist attack in American history, the United States is safer than it was on the day destined to be forever known as 9/11. Yet the threat to the homeland is persistent, ubiquitous and far different than it was before fear of terrorism became part of our national psyche. The Sept. 11, 2001 attacks woke Americans up to the realization that we are not immune from the horror of terrorism that afflicts so many other countries. Every terrorist attack on American soil is devastating, even if relatively few have resulted in double-digit casualties (Fort Hood, San Bernardino and Orlando) and none have come close to replicating 9/11. The Boston Marathon bombing shook the national conscience. All the attacks were excruciating reminders of the omnipresent threat of terrorism on U.S. soil. Many plots have been stopped before they could reach maturation due to the diligent work of the NYPD and other agencies, the FBI and the intelligence community, all of whom have been given the resources to deal with the threat. Credit should also be given to everyday U.S. citizens, who are more cognizant of the threat posed by terrorism and more inclined to alert authorities if something seems out of place. That might be a byproduct of a Homeland Security campaign \u201cIf You See Something, Say Something,\u201d launched in July 2010. But it also might be an unintended consequence of the horrific event that was 9/11; the attack served to bring the nation together. As the country coped with the aftermath, the best of American values were on display, including respect for the dignity and rights of others and love of country. Congress came together and passed a $40 billion emergency appropriation. On September 11, 2001, I was a college senior studying in Ireland, headed for a media sales job in Manhattan. Then 9/11 changed the direction of my life. Growing up on Long Island, I\u2019d imagined careers in finance and law but \u201cterrorism expert\u201d wasn\u2019t on the list. After the attacks I was soon trying to figure out how I could finagle my way into a line of work that quickly became a personal obsession\u2014the study of terrorism. I had never heard of All Qaeda or Salafist jihadism. I didn\u2019t know the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite. While I could barely locate Afghanistan on a map, I knew that many of my friends and family members in the armed forces would soon be deploying overseas. My ignorance became my motivation, and my anger and frustration propelled me to seek knowledge. Within days, I decided to learn about and study the ideology, tactics and motivations of the group that had attacked America. I wanted to help figure out what the United States could do to mitigate this threat. Although my life\u2019s calling grew out of one of the saddest days in U.S. history, I now provide meaningful analysis on one\u00a0of the world\u2019s most intractable problems. The threat from terrorism is not static, so there is a dire need to keep addressing the problem from different angles to help policymakers reach effective solutions for a range of difficult issues. I can be a font of hope, and doom, often in the same sentence. At dinner parties, I am invariably a reluctant conversationalist when the question is, \u201cWhat do you do?\u2014which is often followed by requests for my professional analysis of the state of terrorism today. I know, too well, that 15 years after the attack that changed the nation forever, terrorists still scheme to harm the United States in the name of a deranged ideology. These terrorists are adaptive, resilient and widespread. The terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks,\u00a0 Al Qaeda, is still active, despite experiencing setbacks. Its offshoots, scattered around the globe from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, remain lethal.\u00a0 And its progeny, ISIS, is one of the most dangerous groups in the global jihadist movement. The virulent ideology that motivates jihadists is responsible for radicalizing American citizens who went on to commit acts of mass murder in such places as San Bernardino and Orlando. Countless other plots have been stopped before they could be carried out. New York City, in particular, remains a constant target for terrorists and violent extremists alike. There have been 20 known terrorist plots against New York City alone since 9/11. Yet here\u2019s the part that few want to hear when I start sharing counterterrorism details: The threat from terrorism is not going to go away in the foreseeable future. The U.S. counterterrorism community, along with the American public, needs to remain steadfast in the face of this enduring threat. What does that mean for\u00a0day-to-day life? In short, it means doing a lot of what we, as Americans, have already been doing. Analysis of the threat should continue to be based on data, empirical evidence and robust intelligence, not xenophobia or fear-mongering. The lure of election year demagoguery has proven to be a powerful elixir, but singling out a specific group based on ethnicity or religion will not make Americans safer. Although the global jihadist movement is protean, destroying known hubs and logistical networks can help keep the threat localized in many cases, relegating militants to failed states and ungoverned regions and making it more difficult for them to plan attacks. Reaction to what turned out to be false alarms regarding active shooters at New York and Los Angeles airports show that the fear of terrorism is still palpable -- and understandably so. America\u2019s citizens need to keep the threat from global terrorism in perspective without being dismissive about the very real potential danger. My sincerest hope is that those responsible for protecting the nation will reduce the need for terrorism analysis and put me out of a job within the next 15 years.",

            "article_content": "DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid agencies in the Central African Republic said on Thursday they were racing to prevent the first outbreak of cholera in five years from spreading across the conflict-stricken country. The outbreak, which was declared last week, started in the southern Kemo prefecture before spreading to the capital Bangui, and has infected more than 150 people and killed at least 18 people to date, according to the latest government figures. Medical charity M\ufffd\ufffddecins Sans Fronti\ufffd\ufffdres (MSF) has opened a cholera treatment center in Bangui, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is supporting an awareness-raising campaign along the country's entire southern border. MSF is also monitoring communities along the Oubangui River who use it as their main water source, and said it was working to prevent the river from spreading the epidemic further. \"It is important to react quickly to prevent the spread of the disease because the risk of infection is higher in areas where clean water is limited,\" said Jose Antonio Sanchez of MSF. Cholera, which spreads through contaminated food and drinking water, causes diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The disease can lead to death by dehydration and kidney failure within hours if left untreated, but most patients recover if treated promptly with oral rehydration salts. The IOM said it was concerned about the risk of the cholera outbreak spreading throughout the capital's 26 sites for people uprooted by fighting, which host some 50,000 displaced. Central African Republic descended into chaos in March 2013 when mainly Muslim Seleka fighters seized power, triggering reprisal attacks by Christian anti-balaka militias. President Faustin-Archange Touad\ufffd\ufffdra took office in March after elections aimed at drawing a line under the crisis, but insecurity has since persisted and fresh fighting broke out in Bangui at the end of June. \"Early action to prevent a further spread of the disease is crucial, especially considering the state of many displacement sites here in Bangui,\" said the Anne Schaefer of the IOM, adding that water and sanitation programs were hugely underfunded. The U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) said it was working with the health ministry to give medicine, clean water, purification tablets and hygiene kits to the cholera-hit communities. \"Children are at the highest risk of cholera, but so far we have been lucky that not many children have been infected,\" Souleymane Sow of UNICEF told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Central African Republic was last hit by cholera in 2011, when an epidemic swept through West and Central Africa - one of the biggest in the region's history - infecting more than 85,000 people and killing at least 2,400.

            "article_content": "Correspondent Doug McKelway reports from Washington The night of Donald Trump\u2019s big Indiana Republican primary win, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was ready. She tore loose with a series of late-night anti-Trump tweets in which she accused him of racism, sexism, xenophobia, narcissism and a host of other faults. Two weeks earlier, after\u00a0being asked about another Warren tweet storm in which she accused him of being \"a loser,\" Trump fired a warning shot across Warren's bow. \"Who's that, the Indian? You mean the Indian,\" he responded, referring to a well-known political controversy over Warren claiming Indian heritage. The exchanges signal the start of what could be a nasty surrogate side-battle as the general election campaign begins to take shape. Warren is poised to be an aggressive Trump critic, for the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, should she lock up the nomination. And for Trump, who thrives off detecting weakness and pouncing, Warren is a target-rich environment. From 1986 to 1995, she listed herself as a minority in the Association of American Law Schools directory. Harvard Law School cited her alleged Indian heritage in dealing with criticism that it lacked a diverse faculty. Her recipe in the \"Pow Wow Chow\" cookbook became the subject of derision, after charges it was plagiarized from a New York Times cookbook. \"I think she's a fraud,\" said longtime nemesis and Boston conservative talk radio host, Howie Carr. \"I think her entire success in academia and in politics is based on a lie that she's a Native American. She refuses to take a DNA test. She doesn't even call herself Native American, anymore,\" he said. Asked what the purpose of that alleged fraud would have been, Carr said, \"She was basically going nowhere in her academic career. She was an instructor at the University of Texas Law School in Austin.\u00a0Suddenly she began checking the box and she was a tenured professor first at the University of Pennsylvania, and then she got a job at Harvard University law school. \" Warren's office did not respond to requests for an interview. Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grassroots organization that raised over a million dollars in small donations for Warren's Senate campaign against Scott Brown, believes that Warren relishes baiting Trump and welcomes renewed scrutiny, should it come. \"The more that Donald Trump takes the bait and attacks Elizabeth Warren, and thrusts Elizabeth Warren to the center of the national dialogue, the better for Hillary Clinton because the issues that Elizabeth Warren is fighting for are overwhelmingly popular with general election voters -- from expanding Social Security to alleviating student debt to taking on the big Wall Street banks,\" he said. Her critics, among them former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, whom she beat in the 2012 Senate race, suggest Warren's Twitter tear is not accidental. \"She's been getting on Twitter more and more and criticizing Trump like she is the pit bull for the Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee,\u00a0and, I would suspect, Hillary Clinton,\" he said. Carr added,\u00a0\"I think Hillary Clinton is giving her instructions. She's going to put on her war bonnet and go out and attack Donald Trump.\" One of the ironies of this fight is that the two are vying, at least in part, for the same voters \u2013 blue-collar workers and swing-state independents who may well decide the election. Trump is trying to pull them right with promises of more coal and less regulation, while Warren, with her strong progressive bona fides, is pulling left with a call for more government safety nets and regulation.",

            "article_content": "GOP candidate explains his latest policies and strategies on 'The O'Reilly Factor' Donald Trump told Fox News on Monday he wants to have a \u201cfirm, but fair\u201d stance on illegal immigration, amid signs the Republican presidential nominee may be rethinking his approach on the hot-button campaign issue. Trump\u2019s newly installed campaign team has suggested in recent days possible changes in the candidate\u2019s tough immigration proposals. The nominee\u00a0had been scheduled to deliver a speech on the topic Thursday in Colorado, but has postponed it. In an interview Monday night on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d Trump said: \"I just want to follow the law.\u201d \"The first thing we're gonna do, if and when I win, is we're gonna get rid of all of the bad ones. We've got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. We're gonna get them out,\" he said. \"As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process,\" he said, while citing the policies of President Obama and former President George W. Bush as examples. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the same thing. We\u2019re going to do it in a humane manner,\u201d Trump said, adding that the \u201cbad ones\u201d are known by law enforcement. Asked whether\u00a0Trump's\u00a0plan still included a deportation force, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Sunday it was \"to be determined.\" \"Even Sen. Jeff Sessions,\" a hard-liner on immigration, \"he doesn't deport 11 million people in his plan,\" Conway said on CNBC. There have been signs for weeks now that\u00a0Trump\u00a0may be shifting course. Hispanic business and religious leaders who would like to see\u00a0Trump\u00a0move in a more inclusive direction have reported closed-door conversations with\u00a0Trump\u00a0in which they say he has signaled possibly embracing a less punitive immigration policy that focuses on \"compassion\" along with the rule of law. At last month's GOP convention, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic communications, Helen Aguirre Ferre, told reporters at a Spanish-language briefing that\u00a0Trump\u00a0had already said he \"will not do massive deportations\" \u2014 despite the fact that\u00a0Trump\u00a0had never said so publicly. Instead, Aguirre Ferre said, \"he will focus on removing the violent undocumented who have criminal records and live in the country.\" Indeed,\u00a0Trump's\u00a0first television ad of the general election specifically singles out illegal immigrants with criminal records, claiming that, if Clinton is elected, \"Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay.\" Trump's\u00a0campaign has pushed back on the notion that he's reversing course. \"Mr.\u00a0Trump\u00a0said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech,\" rapid response director Steven Cheung said after the meeting.

The debate, at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, comes at a pivotal point in the race, with the Republican nominee increasingly at odds with leaders of his own party in the wake of a leaked-tape controversy while stepping up his attacks on Clinton. Those attacks have been energized by the leak of thousands of emails from Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, including revealing passages from the Democratic nominee\u2019s paid speeches and other details.

            "article_content": "GOP nominee explains his plans for vetting procedures Donald Trump began his immigration speech Wednesday by promising a \u201cdetailed policy address\u201d rather than a rally speech.\u00a0 It is true that he provided a bit more detail in the ten points he recited before a crowd in Arizona than he has listed on his website since last fall but most of the additional detail came in the form of a chorus of talking points from anti-immigration hardline groups. His policy proposals were a wish-list of the \u201cenforcement only\u201d approach that has been tried, and failed, for the past twenty years.\u00a0 In fact, the entire speech was a full-throated endorsement of the immigration restrictionists\u2019 approach to the immigration debate.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s vision of America is not a shining city on a hill, but a city under siege from dark forces. Trump\u2019s speech provided no \u201cpivot\u201d to a more reasonable immigration policy, and explicitly shut down the possibility of a path to legal status for any immigrant who has overstayed a visa or has entered without authorization. \u00a0It is here that the contradiction at the heart of the \u201cenforcement only\u201d immigration policy lies.\u00a0 What Mr. Trump failed to mention is that we have 11 million people living without legal status in the United States precisely because there are vanishingly few routes through which they can obtain legal status under current law, but there is significant demand from American employers for their work, and from American communities for their contributions. If we are going to \u201cenforce all of our immigration laws,\u201d which provide no path back to legal status regardless of how good a person is or how long they have lived in the United States, then it does not matter how \u201cfair, just and compassionate\u201d the deportation process is.\u00a0 At the end of that process, with no path to legal status, families will be torn apart and American communities will be devastated. Few people discussing the immigration issue today highlight the law at the root of this current immigration dilemma.\u00a0 In 1996, shortly after Pete Wilson won reelection as governor of California on a strongly anti-immigration platform, the Republican-controlled Congress passed, and Democratic President Bill Clinton signed, a bill called the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, or IIRIRA.\u00a0 It is that bill which closed of many of the paths people had been able to use to \u201cget legal\u201d if they had fallen out of status.\u00a0 It created a \u201cone strike and you are out\u201d rule of deportation for a broad range of nonviolent crimes, and it gave sweeping powers to the immigration agencies to deport and remove suspected undocumented immigrants with only limited legal process. From 2002 to 2006, a \u201cno tolerance\u201d immigration policy was imposed within the immigration agencies, and local police departments were given the unfunded mandate of enforcing immigration law through 287(g) agreements.\u00a0 Mr. Trump promises to return to these policies with a vengeance, forgetting that they were ended because police departments wanted them to end due to the damage they did to police-community relations. It is no surprise that one of the speakers introducing Mr. Trump was the Maricopa County Sherriff, Joe Arpaio, who was recently referred for criminal prosecution for his disregard of a federal judge\u2019s order to cease the unconstitutional profiling of U.S. citizens and legal residents who are Latino. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech peddled the fantasy that doubling down on these failed policies will miraculously end crime and unemployment mere months after his election.\u00a0 Twenty years after IIRIRA was passed, these enforcement-only approaches to immigration control have resulted in more than twice as many people without status (5 million in 1996, 11 million today), and a California completely controlled by the Democratic party.\u00a0 The National Review recently suggested rebranding this approach as \u201cenforcement first,\u201d doubling down on the enforcement-only approach with the goal of having as many people as possible self-deport before discussing any path to legal status for those who remain. The enforcement-only or enforcement-first approach ignores two fundamental realities: 1. A majority of Americans support a path to legal status for many of the people presently without one. 2. Unless immigration law provides both workable paths for legal immigration and credible enforcement against those who do not follow those paths, it will not be sustainable.\u00a0 At present, our immigration laws fail to provide such workable paths. After the election, Republicans will have to decide on a path forward with regard to immigration. If Mr. Trump wins the election, they will be asked to go along with his plans for building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, to grant significant additional funding to immigration enforcement agencies, and to federalize local police to assist with enforcement of immigration laws in their communities. If he does not win, there will be an opportunity for us to define a different path forward, one which recognizes that those immigrants Mr. Trump referred to just last week as \u201cgood people\u201d need a path under our laws to legal status and full integration in our communities. We should seize that opportunity to enact laws that resolve the contradiction at the heart of \u201cenforcement only\u201d policies, provide such a path for the \u201cgood people,\u201d and continue the American tradition of welcoming and assimilating immigrants from around the world.",

            "article_content": "FILE - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his wife Melania meet with family members of Phyllis Schlafly before the start of a funeral Mass for Schlafly, Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016, in St. Louis. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP, Pool)) WASHINGTON \u2013 Melania Trump released a letter Wednesday from an immigration attorney that provided more detail on what she said was her legal pathway to U.S. citizenship. But the Slovenian-born wife of the GOP presidential nominee did not publish any part of her immigration file-- official documents that would put to rest questions about whether she followed immigration law. The two-page letter from New York attorney Michael J. Wildes, who has represented Donald Trump's companies, also advanced an alternate timeline for a nude photo shoot that had been cited in news reports as possible evidence of Mrs. Trump working as a model in New York City without authorization. At issue is whether the photo shoot occurred in 1995-- before Mrs. Trump has said she began legally working in the U.S. -- or in 1996, as Mrs. Trump and Wildes assert. The letter marks the first time that Mrs. Trump has publicly identified the type of visas she held and gave specifics about her entry into the U.S. Mrs. Trump has often said she came to the U.S. legally and used her story to defend Donald Trump's hard line on illegal immigration, an issue that he has made a signature part of his campaign. In the letter from Wildes, it's unclear whether Mrs. Trump provided him access to her full immigration file during his review. Wildes wrote that he had reviewed a series of news reports and \"documents regarding the U.S. immigration history of Mrs. Melania Trump.\" But the letter did not indicate which documents. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not immediately respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the review and whether Mrs. Trump planned to release her immigration file for public examination. The immigration file is one of several documents that the Trumps have refused to make public including Donald Trump's tax returns. In his letter, Wildes dismissed news reports that Mrs. Trump had been professionally photographed posing nude in New York City in 1995. Last month, the New York Post published the photos along with an article saying they were taken during a two-day photo shoot in Manhattan in 1995. The Post reported that the photos were then published in the January 1996 issue of the French magazine Max. But Wildes said that then-Melania Knauss was not in the country in 1995. \"The allegation that she participated in a photo shoot in 1995 is not only untrue, it is impossible,\" Wildes wrote. He said he interviewed Mrs. Trump and \"we ascertained that the photo shoot in question did not occur until after she was admitted to the United States in H-1B visa status in October 1996.\" The letter does not give more detail on when Mrs. Trump said the photo shoot occurred. Wildes wrote that Mrs. Trump first entered the U.S. on Aug. 27, 1996, using a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. About two months later, on Oct. 18, 1996, Wildes said the U.S. Embassy in Slovenia issued Mrs. Trump her first worker visa, an H-1B visa, which she used to work as a model. Wildes said she was issued five such visas between October 1996 and 2001, at which point she became a lawful permanent resident. Wildes said he did not represent Mrs. Trump during the process. Wildes wrote that Mrs. Trump did not receive her green card through marriage. Instead, she applied in 2000 by self-sponsoring herself as a model of \"extraordinary ability,\" he said. She received her green card on March 19, 2001, and became eligible for citizenship in 2006, the year Mrs. Trump has said she became a citizen. Simon Rosenberg, an immigration policy analyst who supports Hillary Clinton, said he's skeptical about Mrs. Trump's ability to qualify for self-sponsorship as described in Wildes' letter. Rosenberg, the president of NDN/New Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said, \"The letter resolves nothing.\" \"If they have all the documents, then release them. \u00a0It is the only way we can answer the fundamental question here which is whether Melania Trump followed immigration law,\" he said. William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Wildes' description of Mrs. Trump's immigration history \"is consistent with immigration law, as I know it,\" though he noted the date of the photo shoot is an outstanding question. The qualification to self-sponsor to receive a green card is that a person must show extraordinary ability and national or international renown. Stock said an immigrant seeking this type of green card \"can be extraordinary in anything,\" including modeling, and that the strength of a person's reputation can be part of that proof. Stock said Mrs. Trump or any other immigrant in the same situation would have been measured by the standards in their chosen field.",

            "article_content": "So far in this campaign season, Americans have heard about building a wall on the Southern border, banning Muslims from America, changing foreign policy strategy in the Middle East, stopping illegal immigration\u2014and how big Donald Trump\u2019s hands are. Yet they haven\u2019t heard much serious discussion about meaningful entitlement reform. It may not bet be the most exciting topic, but it\u2019s on a short list of the most important. The United States spent $888 billion on Social Security and $546 billion on Medicare in 2015. Health-care costs are skyrocketing. We\u2019re seeing double-digit insurance-premium hikes, with the expectation that they will only get worse unless we seriously overhaul the Affordable Care Act. Against this backdrop, it\u2019s remarkable that we barely hear any specifics on these issues, beyond an acknowledgement of rising costs. The story is much more complicated than the cost problem\u2014and it isn\u2019t all bad news, either. Aspects of our health care and entitlement system actually work quite well; others, not so much. But in a political season, what\u2019s working gets lumped in with what isn\u2019t, as candidates paint with a broad brush. Take ObamaCare, the costs of which continue to rise. New estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project that the program will cost the federal government $110 billion in 2016. Even so, one thing that\u2019s clear about ObamaCare: repeal is a dead letter, and it should be. The program is in place now, and our task should be how to make it work better.\u00a0 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich has been honest enough to acknowledge this. Over 20 million Americans are now insured because of ObamaCare\u2014that\u2019s a real achievement, but it\u2019s one that we could make more cost-effective. How? For starters, by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines, which would dramatically cut costs for millions of Americans. We should also consider insurance subsidies with fixed credits that Americans can use as they see fit\u2014whether on insurance premiums or health services. Medicare is another area where we hear a lot about costs and not enough about what works and what\u2019s worth protecting. Most Democrats certainly recognize that the program is a lifeline for seniors, but we also hear that we need to cut or even \u201cphase out\u201d Medicare to get the federal debt under control. But health care for the elderly isn\u2019t a bargaining chip. And, critically, every candidate has ignored how well this program actually works\u2014especially Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage). Just last week, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommended that lawmakers strip key patient protections and coverage benefits from Medicare Part D. The commission wants to phase out mandated manufacturer discounts, which would lead to an increase in out-of-pocket expenses; require low-income beneficiaries to purchase off-brand medicines; and remove critical provisions for Part D beneficiaries living with mental illness or those who recently underwent an organ transplant. Yet this is a program with a better than 85 percent approval rating and actually saves money according to the CBO, why would MedPAC want to tamper with it? The same question applies to the massive cuts proposed to Social Security. It\u2019s as if Republicans don\u2019t realize that Americans paid into this program over their working lives. I happen to believe that we do need to consider raising the age at which recipients can claim benefits. But we should also look at returning Social Security to its original and most practical objective: preventing poverty among seniors. We can reduce benefits for higher earners by reshaping the program so that higher-earning seniors would continue to receive benefits that they paid for with decades of taxes, but the system would be reoriented toward benefiting those who need support the most. For example, we could reduce benefits for the highest earning 25 percent or even 50 percent, which research shows would alleviate up to 33 percent of the Social Security funding gap. There\u2019s important work to be done in improving the delivery of entitlement programs and health care more generally in America. Voters are missing an opportunity, however, when candidates won\u2019t talk seriously about entitlements\u2014including the parts that work well\u2014during a crucial presidential campaign. As the campaign season winds on, voters in upcoming primary states should insist that candidate address these issues.",

            "article_content": "Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, VP of research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies explains what can be learned from the investigation WASHINGTON \u2013 The House Benghazi committee's Republican chairman is ignoring statements by his own former lawyer indicating that the U.S. military acted properly on the night of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Libya, the panel's Democrats said. Reps. Elijah Cummings and Adam Smith said Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., omitted the lawyer's comments when he fired back at the Defense Department for criticizing the GOP-led investigation into the attacks that killed four Americans. Gowdy's actions, coupled with delays that have pushed the 2-year-old inquiry into the heat of the 2016 presidential race, \"have damaged the credibility of the Select Committee beyond repair,\" Cummings and Smith wrote Sunday in a letter to Gowdy. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter. Cummings of Maryland is the senior Democrat on the Benghazi panel; Smith, of Washington state, is the senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. He also serves on the select Benghazi panel. The criticism by the two Democrats is the latest volley in an escalating, election-year fight over the Benghazi panel's actions. The panel, created in May 2014, has not conducted a public hearing since October, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified. Democrats call the panel a thinly veiled excuse for Republicans to criticize Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans say the Obama administration has dragged its feet, failing to produce needed documents or interview subjects, delaying a final report. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was among those died during the twin assaults nearly four years ago. Previous investigations blamed management failures at the State Department for a lack of security at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, an issue that has dogged Clinton and other Obama administration officials. Cummings and Smith cite comments by retired Army Lt. Gen. Dana Chipman, who served as chief counsel for Republicans on the Benghazi panel from August 2014 until last January. Chipman \"repeatedly commended the military's actions on the night of the attacks during closed interviews with Defense Department officials,\" Cummings and Smith wrote. Chipman, a former judge advocate general for the Army, attended a closed-door interview with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Jan. 8. Cummings and Smith quote Chipman as telling Panetta: \"I think you ordered exactly the right forces to move out and to head toward a position where they could reinforce what was occurring in Benghazi or Tripoli or elsewhere in the region. And, sir, I don't disagree with the actions you took, the recommendations you made and the decisions you directed.\" Chipman later told Panetta he was \"worried\" that U.S. officials were caught by surprise during the Benghazi raids, which occurred on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Still, Chipman told Panetta: \"Nothing could have affected what occurred in Benghazi,\" Cummings and Smith wrote. The letter from the Democrats comes after Gowdy sent a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter complaining that a top Pentagon official had intentionally mischaracterized the House inquiry. Gowdy said comments by Stephen C. Hedger, assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, were \"riddled with factual inaccuracies\" and did \"a disservice to the public\" and employees at the Defense Department. Hedger, in an April 28 letter to Gowdy, expressed frustration with the Benghazi panel, citing a \"crescendo\" of costly, duplicative and unnecessary requests, including a few based on claims made on Facebook or talk radio.",

            "article_content": "The death of Muhammad Ali \u2013 who lived a rags-to-riches story and overcame prejudice and adversity \u2013 is a reminder that our nation has benefited and our lives have been enriched by people of every income group, religion, race and ethnicity. Ali grew up in a working-class family, the son of a father who was a sign painter and a mother who was a domestic worker, and attended segregated all-black schools. When he left Christianity to become a Muslim and changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, he was denounced by many. Yet against all odds, he became not just a great boxer and multimillionaire, but a great humanitarian and a beloved icon who worked for peace and harmony around the world. Fortunately, much progress has been made in the long struggle to make equal opportunity a reality in our country and to embrace diversity as a strength, instead of rejecting it as a weakness. But we still don\u2019t take advantage of the talents of all our people. For example, there are millions of young people born into poor families who could do great things for our nation, if only we opened the doors of higher education to them. Without college degrees, the career prospects of even our most talented young people are limited. But with degrees, they could make great contributions \u2013 healing the sick, starting new businesses to create millions of jobs, working in nonprofits and government, and much more. Yet many academically qualified young people face tremendous obstacles keeping them out of many colleges and universities \u2013 whether because they come from low-income families, are undocumented or for other reasons. In some cases, young people been thrown out of their homes without financial support by their parents for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. In my role as executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which awards scholarships to high-achieving students from low-income families, I\u2019ve met many students like these. Thankfully, we\u2019ve been able to help some of them go on to college, but we don\u2019t have the funds to help the millions of young people who could benefit. Let me tell you about one of these students, a young woman with exemplary grades and a history of volunteering on behalf of her community who submitted an application for a Cooke Scholarship. Let\u2019s call her Teresa. \u201cAt 15, I watched my mother and brother handcuffed and dragged from our home by immigration officials,\u201d Teresa wrote in her application. \u201cI was a minor so they chose not to deport me, but the painful family separation lasted a decade, 10 years\u2019 worth of lonely birthdays and Christmases. I made countless attempts to attend college, but each resulted in failure as my above average grades were not enough to overshadow a missing 13-digit resident number on applications. Disheartened and discouraged, I stopped dreaming.\u201d Teresa continued: \u201cIn constant fear of deportation, my legal status was something I hid even from my closest friends. Since I couldn\u2019t go to college, cleaning gloves and Clorox replaced my textbooks. As a housemaid, I worked 12-hour shifts earning $20 a day. Besides deportation, I also faced the threat of homelessness. My life had no direction; I couldn\u2019t get an education, I couldn\u2019t grow, I couldn\u2019t flourish. No one would give me a chance.\u201d The story has a happy ending. Teresa now has legal status under President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u00a0(DACA) program, which defers attempts to expel immigrant children who entered the United States before they turn 16. She has the grades and academic record to attend an elite college, and the Cooke Foundation will help her do so. But there are many more Teresas across our nation whose dreams of a college education will never come true. This is not just a personal tragedy for the students. It is an American tragedy. Muhammad Ali achieved success and world renown without ever going to college. But few young people have the skills to become professional athletes. And today a college degree is required for far more jobs than it was in 1960, when Cassius Clay graduated from high school. Both morality and our national self-interest demand that we give our young people the chance to climb as high as they can on the education ladder, regardless of the wealth of their families, how they pray, where they come from, the color of their skin or who they love. Ali called himself \"The Greatest.\" Embracing diversity and equal opportunity for all is what enables America to claim the same title.",

With police departments across the country on high alert for similar attacks and protests still ongoing, will Obama feel obliged to interrupt his winter break to offer some guidance on the subject? He broke away briefly from his summer vacation to make remarks about the beheading of an American at the hands of Islamist militants. The pressure is growing from police and their supporters for Obama to do the same for the slain officers.

Beginning at 8 a.m. Monday, more than 22,000 Arizonans who have qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will become legally able to drive. But first they have to apply for and qualify for a license\u2026The rush comes following a preliminary injunction issued Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell prohibiting Arizona from refusing to license DACA recipients. These are individuals who arrived in this country illegally as children and meet other conditions\u2026ADOT spokesman Tim Tait said the licenses issued to dreamers will be identical to those given to other Arizonans who meet the requirements to drive -- with one significant difference: The licenses will self-destruct on a regular basis.

But the issue of how to use \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d has divided Republicans, with some calling for it to be implemented to overhaul the tax code or to push through major energy reforms. The tool is useful because it could allow newly-empowered Senate Republicans to pass legislation with a 51-vote simple majority rather than the usual 60, greatly increasing the chances of moving legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk. And while Obama is certain to veto anything that tries to roll back his landmark healthcare law, Republicans increasingly see reconciliation as an important messaging tool to help paint a contrast with Democrats on Obamacare ahead of 2016\u2026Republicans will likely settle on a strategy in mid-January when they map out their 2015 agenda at a joint House and Senate retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

But how did a decidedly German car end up with a decidedly non-German name like Mercedes. It was on this day in 1900 that Austrian car racer, Emil Jellinek became the first Mercedes owner. So eager for a sleeker and lighter car that would travel faster and win races easily, Jellinek went to the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft plant demanding the fastest car they could create. He negotiated a deal to purchase 36 vehicles and as part of the package, Daimler agreed to name the line after his then 11-year-old daughter, Mercedes. The car was such a hit that two years later the company legally registered the Mercedes name and Jellinek himself changed the family name to Jellinek-Mercedes in appreciation for his latest race cars.

            "article_content": "Bias Bash: Justin Duckham asks why the media are missing the connection between campaign trail and Capitol Hill Ted Cruz unveiled a hard-line immigration plan on Friday that includes a border wall as he also ramped up attacks on rival Marco Rubio, saying the Florida senator stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" with lawmakers in support of a \"massive amnesty plan\" for illegal immigrants. \"Immigration is an issue that divides this country, it is an issue that divides the Republican Party,\" Cruz, a Texas senator, said during a rally with supporters in Orlando. The Cruz plan includes everything from building a complete southern border wall to ending birthright citizenship to halting legal immigration when unemployment gets \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d \"I will complete the wall,\" Cruz vows in the plan, endorsing an objective that Donald Trump has been touting for months. Shortly before releasing the document, Cruz zeroed in on Republican presidential rival Rubio, who is third in most national polls and narrowly ahead of Cruz. \"Listen, I like Marco a lot, he is charming and he's very well-liked in Washington,\" Cruz told Fox News right before hitting the stage. \"But at the end of the day, where you stand on the issues speaks volumes.\" Cruz accused Rubio of being the \"point of the spear\" for the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" senators who tried to come up with a comprehensive immigration policy in 2013 and failed. He accused Rubio of standing \"shoulder to shoulder\" with them. \"Where you stood up and lined up on the Gang of Eight bill was a time for choosing,\" Cruz later said during the rally. Without naming names, he blasted Republicans who support giving law-abiding illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. \"There is nothing compassionate about a politician saying I am so compassionate I am willing to give away your jobs.\" Rubio shot back on Friday. \"On the immigration front, as I said, I'm puzzled and quite frankly surprised by Ted's attacks since Ted's position on immigration is not much different than mine,\" Rubio told reporters after his own speech Friday. \"He's a supporter of legalizing people who are in this country illegally. If he's changed that position, then someone has a right to change his position on the issue but he should be clear about that.\" When asked about this Friday, Cruz quipped, \"I have to say, when I heard that I laughed out loud. I understand why he regrets having taken the position he did. To say we are on the same [page] on the immigration issue is to say my position and Barack Obama's position on health care is the same.\" Cruz, meanwhile, said President Obama lacks the \"will\" to build a complete wall along the southern border and as president he would \u00a0\u201cbuild a wall that works,\" along with tripling the number of border agents, increasing surveillance, and adding biometric screening at entry checkpoints. Further, Cruz says he would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving financial benefits and strengthen E-Verify for employers.\u00a0He would suspend the issuance of all H-1B (employment) visas for 180 days for audit to ensure it is not being abused.\u00a0He would also require that anyone coming in with an H-1B visa have an advanced degree, and prevent employers bringing these visa holders in from laying off domestic workers for a set period of time. Cruz's position on high-skilled visas represents a complete about-face on one of his long-held immigration stances. During the Senate immigration debate two years ago, the Texas senator was an outspoken advocate for increasing legal immigration, particularly for highly skilled immigrants. He called legal immigration \"a pillar of our nation's heritage and strength\" and introduced amendments to double the cap on legal immigration and increase the number of high-skilled immigrant visas by 500 percent. Perhaps most radically in the new plan, Cruz says he would halt \u201cany increases in legal immigration so long as American unemployment remains unacceptably high.\u201d\u00a0He would also enforce the \u201cpublic-charge\u201d doctrine, which would force immigrants to certify they are self-sufficient before they are given permission to live in the U.S. \u201cThe purpose of legal immigration should be to grow the economy, not displace American workers,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder no circumstances should legal immigration levels be adjusted upwards so long as work-force participation rates remain below historical levels.\u201d He would also take steps to pass legislation or pursue a constitutional amendment to end \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d which grants citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil. Cruz also said he will \u201cend President Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty\u201d by rescinding any executive orders allowing people who are here illegally to stay, and end any federal support for cities with so-called \u201csanctuary policies\u201d which he said \u201cmake a mockery of our laws and endanger our citizens.\u201d On Syrian refugees, Cruz was unequivocal. \"They need to be settled in the Middle East and majority Muslim countries,\" not in the U.S., where \"it makes no sense whatsoever.\" He suggested that most of the refugees entering Europe from the war zones are \"young men\" and among them could be members of the Islamic State. \"It is lunacy to bring refugees into this country who may be terrorists trying to murder Americans,\" he said.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (The Associated Press) Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in Youngstown, Ohio, Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (The Associated Press) COORECTS BYLINE TO JAKE DANNA STEVENS NOT CHRISTOPHER DOLAN - Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wave as they enter Riverfront Sports Complex for a campaign event in Scranton, Pa., Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. (Jake Danna Stevens/The Times &amp; Tribune via AP) (The Associated Press) YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2013 Donald Trump is calling for \"extreme\" vetting of immigrants seeking admission to the United States, but he's offering few specifics about how that might work, how long it might last or how taxpayers would foot the bill. Trump, who had previously called for an unprecedented temporary ban on immigration by Muslims, vowed Monday to overhaul the country's screening process and block those who sympathize with extremist groups or don't embrace American values. \"Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into our country,\" Trump said in a foreign policy address in Youngstown, Ohio. \"Only those who we expect to flourish in our country \u2014 and to embrace a tolerant American society \u2014 should be issued visas.\" The GOP presidential nominee has made stricter immigration measures a central part of his proposals for defeating the Islamic State \u2014 a battle he said Monday is akin to the struggle against communism during the Cold War. He called for parents, teachers and others to promote \"American culture\" and encouraged \"assimilation.\" But he didn't say which countries or regions would be subject to the \"extreme\" vetting, and his announcement that government agencies would create the list suggested that would not happen before the election in November. The candidate's aides said federal agencies would use questionnaires, social media, interviews with family and friends or other means to vet applicants' stances on issues including religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights. Trump did not clarify how U.S. officials would assess the veracity of responses to the questionnaires or how much manpower it would require to complete such arduous vetting. He did say that implementing the policy overhaul would require a temporary halt in immigration from \"the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism.\" \"We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures,\" Trump said. The address comes during a trying stretch for Trump's presidential campaign. He's struggled to stay on message and build a consistent case against Democrat Hillary Clinton, repeatedly roiling the White House race with provocative comments that have deeply frustrated many in his own party. Clinton has seized on Republican concerns about Trump, highlighting the steady stream of GOP national security experts who've said their party's nominee is unfit to serve as commander in chief. She kept up that argument Monday as she campaigned alongside Vice President Joe Biden in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a working class area where both have family ties. Biden called Trump's views \"dangerous\" and \"un-American.\" He warned that Trump's false assertions last week about President Barack Obama founding the Islamic State extremist group could be used by extremists to target American service members in Iraq. \"The threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks,\" Biden said. Trump has since said he was being sarcastic in accusing Obama of founding the Islamic State. Still, he directly blamed the president and Clinton, who served as Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, for backing policies that \"unleashed\" the group, including withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011. He also challenged Clinton's fitness to be president, declaring she lacks the \"mental and physical stamina\" to take on the extremists. Trump was vague about what he would do differently to decimate the Islamic State in its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. He vowed to partner with any country that shares his goal of defeating the extremist group, regardless of other strategic disagreements, and named Russia as a nation he would like to improve relations with. Russia and the U.S. have been discussing greater coordination in Syria, where the Islamic State is part of a volatile mix of groups fighting for power. But they have been unable to reach an agreement on which militant groups could be targeted. Trump also vowed to end \"our current strategy of nation-building and regime change\" \u2014 a criticism that extends to policies of both parties. He panned the long, expensive Iraq War started under Republican President George W. Bush, as well as Obama's calls for new leadership in some Middle East countries during the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings. Obama has held up Bush's years-long commitment to setting up and securing a new government in Iraq after the initial invasion as a reason to avoid U.S. military intervention in countries like Syria. Trump's most specific anti-Islamic State proposals centered on keeping those seeking to carry out attacks in the West from entering the United States. He said attacks involving \"immigrants or the children of immigrants\" underscore the need to implement \"extreme vetting.\" Trump first announced his call for banning Muslims last year during the GOP primary. He introduced a new standard following the June massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, vowing to \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\" That proposal raised numerous questions that the campaign never clarified, including whether it would apply to citizens of countries like France, Israel, or Ireland, which have suffered recent and past attacks. ___ What political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

            "article_content": "Ed Rollins goes 'in the ring' to determine who landed the biggest political punches Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead over Donald Trump has increased to seven points, as more than half of voters say he is not qualified to be president. That\u2019s according to a just-released national Fox News Poll of likely voters. Clinton receives 45 percent to Trump\u2019s 38 percent. \u00a0Libertarian Gary Johnson is at 7 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein gets 3 percent. \u00a0Last week, Clinton was up by two points in the four-way contest (44-42 percent). In the two-way matchup, it\u2019s Clinton over Trump by eight (49-41 percent). \u00a0She had a four-point edge a week ago (48-44 percent, Oct. 3-6). Clinton\u2019s lead is outside the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error in both the two-way and four-way contests. The poll, out Thursday, was conducted Monday-Wednesday. \u00a0The second presidential debate was Sunday. On Friday, The Washington Post made public a hot-mic recording of Trump from Access Hollywood. \u00a0On the same day, WikiLeaks began its release of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign, revealing more on Monday through Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS In the four-way race, Clinton is favored among non-whites (+62 points), suburban women (+24), women (+19), and voters under 30 (+16). \u00a0Third party candidates hurt her among younger voters, as about one in four of them go for Johnson or Stein. Trump\u2019s the pick for men (+5 points), whites (+14), and whites without a college degree (+25). Since last week, the largest declines in support for him are among women ages 45 and over (down 12 points), voters ages 65+ (down 11), suburban women (down 10), white women with a college degree (down 7), GOP women (down 6), and white college graduates (down 6). Support for Trump among white evangelical Christians held steady at 68 percent. \u00a0Typically, however, about three-quarters of white evangelicals vote for the GOP nominee. \u00a0Trump\u2019s support among regular church-goers dropped eight points, from 53 to 45 percent. Independents split, giving 35 percent to each Clinton and Trump, with another 21 percent backing Johnson or Stein. \u00a0Trump was up by 12 points among independents in late September. Eighty-one percent of Democrats back Clinton and 80 percent of Republicans support Trump. \"If the Republicans are not at rock-bottom, they can certainly see the bottom from where they are,\" says GOP pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"If Trump got 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and nothing else -- no Democrats and no independents -- he'd be at 32 percent.\u201d Trump\u2019s enthusiasm advantage has evaporated: 70 percent of his backers \u201cstrongly\u201d supported him last week. \u00a0That\u2019s 63 percent now. \u00a0For Clinton, it\u2019s 66 percent, up from 57 percent. Yet the number of Republicans satisfied with Trump as their nominee is mostly unchanged: \u00a048 percent are happy with him at the top of the ticket vs. 52 percent a month ago. Among Democrats, 54 percent are happy with Clinton, while 38 percent still wish it were Bernie Sanders. Overall, 64 percent believe Clinton has the right temperament to serve effectively and 68 percent say she\u2019s qualified to be president. It\u2019s the opposite for Trump, as 63 percent think he lacks the temperament and 56 percent say he isn\u2019t qualified. \u00a0For 49 percent, he is \u201cnot at all\u201d qualified. Are the candidates good role models for children? \u00a0Voters say Clinton is (54 yes vs. 43 no). \u00a0And Trump is not (20 yes vs. 77 no). Thirty-three percent say Clinton is honest and trustworthy. \u00a0For Trump, it\u2019s 32 percent. \u00a0That\u2019s a four-point drop for him since last week. \u201cPut simply, the last week has been a disaster for Trump,\u201d says Anderson. \u00a0\u201cAnd more than ever, voters think he lacks the temperament and qualifications to be president.\u201d Trump\u2019s personal ratings also took a hit, while Clinton\u2019s improved. \u00a0More voters view her negatively than positively by five points (47 favorable vs. 52 unfavorable). \u00a0Last week she was underwater by nine. \u00a0Trump\u2019s rating stands at negative 23 (38 favorable vs. 61 unfavorable). \u00a0That\u2019s eight points more negative today, as he was underwater by 15 a week ago. Among Republicans, his favorable rating dropped 11 points, from 84 percent to 73 percent. Clinton now tops Trump on every issue tested. \u00a0More voters trust her to handle foreign policy (+24 points), health care (+13), terrorism (+11), immigration (+9), and the economy (+3). \u00a0For the past month, Trump had been the choice on the economy, and the two were about evenly matched on terrorism. Clinton is preferred to handle health care despite nearly half wanting to get rid of President Obama\u2019s signature law. \u00a0Forty-nine percent of registered voters want to repeal Obamacare vs. 45 percent who prefer to keep it in place. \u00a0That\u2019s a more positive rating for the law than the last time the Fox News Poll asked in December 2014. \u00a0Then it was 58 percent repeal and 38 percent keep. Meanwhile, a growing number expect another President Clinton. Sixty-five percent think she\u2019ll win in November. \u00a0That\u2019s 10 points higher than last week (55 percent) -- and 19 higher than June (46 percent). \u00a0Some 23 percent think Trump will win. Americans head to the polls in an even worse mood than four years ago. \u00a0In October 2012, 53 percent of registered voters were dissatisfied with how things were going in the country. \u00a0Now, 59 percent are dissatisfied. Even so, 56 percent approve of the job Barack Obama is doing as president. \u00a0That\u2019s up from 52 percent a week ago -- and a record high for his second term. \u00a0Moreover, his approval has been 48 percent or better since February. Pollpourri Trump\u2019s video troubles and subsequent attacks on GOP leaders are hurting the party. \u00a0One indication is more registered voters now consider themselves a Democrat than a Republican -- by nine points (44-35 percent), compared to by four points last week (41-37 percent). Democrats usually hold an advantage over Republicans nationally in party identification, and this year self-identified Democrats have outnumbered self-identified Republicans by an average of three percentage points in Fox News polls. The poll asks likely voters to choose between the Democratic and Republican candidates in their Congressional district and finds Democrats up by six points, 48-42 percent. \u00a0Democrats were up by just one at the end of September (44-43 percent). \"The Democrats are now prohibitive favorites to win the presidency, favorites to take the Senate, and it is no longer unthinkable that they could challenge in the House,\" says Shaw. Endorsing Trump is still a net positive for Congressional candidates: 27 percent of Republicans say they are more likely to vote for a Congressional candidate who refuses to endorse Trump, yet more -- 39 percent -- say they are less likely to do so. No matter who wins, voters are concerned scandals will have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on the administration: \u00a066 percent are worried about scandals in a Clinton administration and 63 percent if it\u2019s Trump. \u00a0More Democrats (54 percent) are concerned about scandals in a Clinton White House than Republicans are about a Trump administration (41 percent). Forty-eight percent of voters familiar with the video of Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks say it\u2019s a deal breaker for them. \u00a0Fifteen percent of Republicans and 40 percent of independents also feel that way. For comparison, 37 percent of voters familiar with Clinton\u2019s leaked emails say transcripts of her speeches to big Wall Street donors are a deal breaker. \u00a0That includes 11 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Sanders supporters. Trump\u2019s attacks on how Clinton has handled her husband\u2019s past controversies with women aren\u2019t sticking. \u00a0Seventy-two percent think Clinton \u201cstands up\u201d for women. \u00a0Thirty-eight percent say Trump \u201crespects\u201d women. The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 10-12, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 917 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to an exclusive poll released Thursday, a signal that despite years of recovery from the Great Recession, Americans' financial conditions remains precarious as ever. These financial difficulties span all income levels, according to the poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Seventy-five percent of people in households making less than $50,000 a year would have difficulty coming up with $1,000 to cover an unexpected bill. But when income rose to between $50,000 and $100,000, the difficulty decreased only modestly to 67 percent. Even for the country's wealthiest 20 percent \u2014 households making more than $100,000 a year \u2014 38 percent say they would have at least some difficulty coming up with $1,000. \"The more we learn about the balance sheets of Americans, it becomes quite alarming,\" said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute focusing on poverty and emergency savings issues. Harry Spangle is one of those Americans. A 66-year-old former electrician from New Jersey, Spangle said he thought he would always have a job and \"lived for today\" but lost his job before the downturn. He said he would have to borrow from friends or family in order to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense. \"I have a pension and I am on Social Security, but it's very limiting,\" he said. \"It's depressing.\" Having a modest, immediately available emergency fund is widely recognized as critical to financial health. Families that have even a small amount of non-retirement savings, between $250 and $749, are less likely to be evicted from their homes and less likely to need public benefits, an Urban Institute study found. \"People are extremely vulnerable if they don't have savings,\" Ratcliffe said. \"And it's a cost to taxpayers as well. Lack of savings can lead to homelessness, or other problems.\" Despite an absence of savings, two-thirds of Americans said they feel positive about their finances , according to survey data released Wednesday by AP-NORC, a sign that they're managing day-to-day expenses fine. The challenge for many often come from economic forces beyond their control such as a dip in the stock market that threatens their job or an unexpected medical bill, risks that have shattered the confidence of most in the broader U.S. economy. Yet when faced with an unexpected $1,000 bill, a majority of Americans said they wouldn't be especially likely to pay with money on hand, the AP-NORC survey found. A third said they would have to borrow from a bank or from friends and family, or put the bill on a credit card. Thirteen percent would skip paying other bills, and 11 percent said they would likely not pay the bill at all. Those numbers suggest that most American families do not have at least $1,000 stashed away in an accessible savings account, much less under their mattresses, to cover an emergency. Americans' struggle to save isn't new. Three CBS News and The New York Times polls going back to the mid-1990s \u2014 the most recent one done in 2007 before the downturn \u2014 show a majority of Americans would have some difficulty covering a $1,000 emergency. The AP-NORC results also correlate with a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve in which 47 percent of respondents said they either could not cover a $400 emergency expense or would have to sell something or borrow money. And the struggle impacts retirement savings as well. When AP-NORC asked if they will have enough savings to retire when they want to, 54 percent of working Americans say they are not very or not at all confident they will have enough. Only 14 percent say they are confident they can retire on time. The findings in the AP-NORC poll illuminate how many Americans' frustrations over the economy, income inequality and insecurity about their financial futures has contributed to this dizzying presidential election season. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party largely on a populist platform of kicking out undocumented immigrants, renegotiating free trade agreements and a promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" On the left, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont captured voters with a message of dismantling Wall Street and higher taxes on the rich. The reasons why Americans don't save are complex. One economist says it's a holdover from the '70s and '80s, when high inflation ate into the value of money stashed in a savings account. Others say U.S. tax policy rewards saving money for retirement or taking out a mortgage to buy a home over short-term emergencies. The Great Recession and lack of wage growth in recent years have not helped. In the same AP-NORC poll, 46 percent of workers said their wages have remained stagnant in the last five years, and another 16 percent said they've actually seen salary cuts. Meanwhile, costs for basic needs, such as food, housing and health care, have risen. \"The lack of (savings) is symptomatic to other financial problems that families are having,\" said William R. Emmons, a senior economic adviser at the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Many families are still struggling with debt from the housing bubble and borrowing boom. And the recent economic stresses make it much more likely families are going to be fighting basic financial issues.\" Mitchell Timme, 26, said that his wages have remained basically flat for the last few years while his cost of living has increased. Once everything is paid \"there's nothing left to save,\" he said. \"It definitely adds stress to everyday life. It hangs over you. While it's not something you would complain about every day, it's there. And it weighs on you,\" Timme said, who works at a security company in Phoenix. It may not be entirely bad that some Americans do not have much cash savings, Emmons said. In the poll, 21 percent of Americans say they would strongly consider the option of putting the unexpected $1,000 bill on a credit card to be paid in full when their statement came due. \"For financially stronger families, having access to low-cost credit is completely acceptable,\" he said. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,008 adults was conducted April 14-18 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.

Part of Trump\u2019s so called \u201cnew deal\u201d included new tax incentives for inner cities, new micro-loans for African-Americans to start companies and hire workers and plan to reinvest money form suspended refugee programs in inner cities. POLL SHOWS TRUMP GAINING ON CLINTON \u201cI will be your greatest champion,\u201d Trump told a predominantly white Charlotte crowd. \u201cI will never ever take the African American community for granted. Never, ever.\u201d Trump also pledged to take on gang members and remove them from inner cities. He also claimed that the national murder rate was as high as it\u2019s been in 45 years. \u201cSome of our inner cities are more dangerous than the war zones we\u2019re reading about and seeing about every night.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump was in Washington touting his business empire in the ribbon-cutting ceremony for his new hotel. He made the case that all Americans should look to his corporate record for evidence of how well he\u2019d run the country if elected president. \"Under budget and ahead of schedule. So important. We don't hear those words so often, but you will,\" said Trump, linking the hotel redevelopment \u2014 just blocks from the White House \u2014 to his promised performance as president. \"Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.\" As Trump opened his hotel, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was blasting his business practices on the campaign trail in the key battleground state of Florida. She used campaign events in Florida to attack the GOP nominee for having \"stiffed American workers,\" saying he built his empire with Chinese-manufactured steel, overseas products and labor from immigrants in the country illegally. \"Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy,\" she told several thousand supporters in Tampa, Florida. \"He refuses to pay workers and contractors.\" Clinton also told reporters: \"I was struck today that Donald Trump was paying more attention to his business than to the campaign. That's his choice but we're going to keep working really hard to reach as many voters as possible.\" As the Nov. 8 election looms, the newest Fox News Poll shows Clinton leading Trump by just three points. In an effort to play some political defense, Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence was touting the campaign in Utah in hopes to keep votes from choosing Independent Evan McMullin over the two mainstream candidates. Besides Utah, Pence also was stopping in the swing states of Nevada and Colorado before heading Thursday to solidly Republican Nebraska. Trump, who also held a rally in the city of Kinston, continued to insist he knows more than the nation's military leaders, especially when it comes to the fight against Islamic State militants in the city of Mosul. \"You can tell your military expert that I'll sit down and I'll teach him a couple of things,\" he said in an interview with ABC.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on pundits' tendency to assume Donald Trump has no chance of winning the election If Donald Trump can continue to gain ground in a few key states by next Tuesday, he will win the presidency. I\u2019m not making any predictions. I\u2019m not for or against Trump. He still faces an uphill climb, given the Democrats\u2019 inherent Electoral College advantage, and would need to grab a major blue state. But with polling gains in such states as Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire, Trump has enough of a path that with four days to go, he still has a shot. How, one might ask, is that possible, given the extraordinary media avalanche that has tried to bury him? How can he still be competitive after most of the country\u2019s newspapers and magazines have not just opposed him, but said he is utterly beyond the pale as a plausible president? What does that say about the media? It is beyond dispute that Trump has drawn far more coverage, and far more negative coverage than Hillary Clinton, and that some media critics have applauded this imbalance. And the public gets it. Check out this USA Today poll: \u201cBy nearly 10-1, all those surveyed say the news media, including major newspapers and TV stations, would like to see Clinton rather than Trump elected. That includes 82 percent of Trump supporters and 74 percent of Clinton supporters.\u201d On the opinion side, this will give you the flavor of the media opposition. A New York Times editorial says that from the moment he got in the race, \u201cit became clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.\u201d A Washington Post editorial: \u201cMr. Trump\u2026has shown himself to be bigoted, ignorant, deceitful, narcissistic, vengeful, petty, misogynistic, fiscally reckless, intellectually lazy, contemptuous of democracy and enamored of America\u2019s enemies. As president, he would pose a grave danger to the nation and the world.\u201d Trump has also been opposed by papers that never endorse, like USA Today; by papers that have never backed a Democrat, like the Arizona Republic (126 years); by magazines that haven\u2019t endorsed in 52 years, like the Atlantic. Plus, Trump has much of the conservative media establishment, including National Review and the Weekly Standard, doggedly against him. Now the GOP nominee, for his part, has run hard against the \u201cdisgustingly dishonest\u201d media. And obviously the media, for all their agenda-setting influence, don\u2019t control the outcome of elections. But what does it say that most of the media establishment is so relentlessly negative against a guy who is going to win at least 20 states and possibly more? To me, it goes back to the way the MSM originally dismissed Trump as a sideshow and a joke, a guy who deserved to be in the Huffington Post\u2019s Entertainment section. But it goes far deeper than that. The reason the media missed the rise of Trump is that they were out of touch with the anger and frustration of so many voters, especially working-class Americans. And even now, there is too little empathy for these voters and too little understanding of what motivates them, especially in certain precincts of New York, Washington and L.A. Instead, there is plenty of condescension toward these voters, a feeling that they\u2019re racist or xenophobic or just so ill-informed that they don\u2019t realize that Trump is selling them snake oil. Here is Times columnist Charles Blow declaring Trump an \u201cexistential threat,\u201d declaring \u201cwith my last breath: America, are you (expletive) kidding?! \u201cI simply cannot wrap my head around how others with level heads and sound minds can even consider Trump for president of this country and leader of the free world.\u201d What a message: America, you must be dumb or crazy to support this guy. Beginning next Wednesday, there will be plenty of hand-wringing about the ugly campaign, the Clinton investigations, the future of the Republican Party and so on. But perhaps the media need to engage in some soul-searching about why a good chunk of the country doesn\u2019t view Trump and his appeal with the utter disdain that they do.",

Authorities said Glenn opened fire on a Philadelphia police officer then went on a shooting rampage, injuring a second officer, killing a woman and wounding three other people before he was shot and killed by police overnight Friday. (Philadelphia Police Department via AP) (The Associated Press) PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Authorities have identified the woman killed during a shooting rampage that also wounded two police officers as the 25-year-old daughter of Ethiopian immigrants. Sara Salih was shot seven times while sitting in a vehicle Friday night with a 36-year-old man, who was shot in the arm and chest. Moments before, police say, suspect Nicholas Glenn had fired about 18 shots at veteran police Sgt. Sylvia Young as she sat in her patrol cruiser on a West Philadelphia street corner. He then randomly fired five shots at two bar employees, a 42-year-old man and 41-year-old woman, as he ran down the street. Glenn later died in a shootout with responding officers. Beyan Salih, Sara's father, heard the gunshots from the family's apartment during the Friday overnight attack but didn't know his daughter had been shot until after he got home from work Saturday afternoon, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported (http://bit.ly/2cprBbj ). That's when he was told she had died. \"I didn't know,\" he said, sobbing on his front porch. \"How could she be gone? How could this happen?\" Sara's sister, Fatima Salih, said Sara was a newborn when the family immigrated to Philadelphia in 1992 and that she had attended school in southwest Philadelphia. Fatima Salih described Sara as \"outgoing and outspoken,\" with dreams of becoming a paralegal. \"She always loved dreaming about the future,\" Fatima Salih said. Authorities say the 25-year-old Glenn apparently targeted Salih and the man she was with at random. Glenn also shot one of the responding officers, University of Pennsylvania police officer Ed Miller. Miller was treated for gunshot wounds to his hip and ankle and was released from the hospital Sunday. Four Philadelphia Eagles players visited before his release. Young was shot in her shoulder, arm and chest and remains hospitalized in stable condition. Police say all the injured are expected to survive. Investigators say Glenn had a note that expressed hatred for law enforcement and a probation officer at the time of the attack. He fired at least 51 shots during the rampage and was armed with more ammunition, authorities said. ___ Information from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee addresses the DNC PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton, declaring that the country faces a \u201cmoment of reckoning,\u201d sealed her status in American history Thursday night as the first woman to top a major-party ticket, officially taking the torch from President Obama as the Democratic nominee for president. The former first lady, senator and Secretary of State delivered a blistering attack against Republican nominee Donald Trump, challenging his fitness to occupy the Oval Office and setting the tone for what promises to be a bruising three-month campaign. \u201cThe choice is clear,\u201d Clinton told delegates in Philadelphia in a 56-minute, optimistic speech that stood in contrast to Trump's convention speech in which the mogul pounded away at headwinds facing the nation and drove home the urgent need for change. \"He's taken the Republican Party a long way, from 'Morning in America' to 'Midnight in America,'\" Clinton said, following a warm introduction in which her daughter, Chelsea, painted a personal picture of Hillary the mother and grandmother. \"He wants to divide us - from the rest of the world, and from each other. \u201cHe\u2019s betting that the perils of today\u2019s world will blind us to its unlimited promise,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: \u2018The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u2019\u201d The speech was interrupted many times by noisy protests from supporters of former rival Bernie Sanders, which were soon drowned out by Clinton loyalists chanting, \u201cHillary!\u201d Clinton, 68, sought to win over the Sanders backers, as well as disaffected Republicans and independents, vowing to fight for working people. \u201cI will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful \u2026 for all Americans together,\u201d she said. Clinton laid out a largely liberal agenda that at times echoed themes from Sanders\u2019 campaign that have weaved their way into the party platform, on issues ranging from taxes to the minimum wage to immigration to health care. Trump struck back before the night was over, releasing a statement that accused Democrats of creating a \u201cfantasy world\u201d at their convention and spreading a false message that \u201ceverything is wonderful.\u201d \u201cAt Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention this week, Democrats have been speaking about a world that doesn\u2019t exist,\" the statement read. \"A world where America has full employment, where there\u2019s no such thing as radical Islamic terrorism, where the border is totally secured, and where thousands of innocent Americans have not suffered from rising crime in cities like Baltimore and Chicago.\u201d Trump, who surged ahead of Clinton in most polls following his own party's convention last week, spoke at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and panned the DNC convention before it wrapped up. \"I think we'll stay here all night because I don't really want to go home and watch that crap,\" he said. And he bashed Clinton's address on Twitter: The deeply personal attacks capped by last night's back-and-forth portend a potentially bitter run-up to the November election. Trump has taken to calling Clinton \"Crooked Hillary,\" while Clinton and other Democrats have maligned Trump as a loose cannon who lacks the temperament to be president. \u201cHe loses his cool at the slightest provocation,\u201d Clinton said in her speech. \u201cImagine, if you dare, imagine \u2026 him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 closing convention night included a sharper security focus than earlier in the week. Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, who led troops in Afghanistan, vouched Thursday for Clinton as the candidate who can keep the country \u201csafe and free.\u201d \u201cAmerica will defeat ISIS,\u201d he vowed, naming the terror enemy that seemingly was glossed over by earlier convention speakers. As he spoke, competing chants of \u201cUSA\u201d and \u201cNo More War\u201d broke out in the audience. The final night capped a dramatic week in Philadelphia that started with the abrupt resignation of party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz amid yet another email scandal and ended with an all-hands-on-deck push for unity meant to ease unrest among Sanders supporters and others who spent the convention railing against the Democratic establishment. Even on the final day, protesters organized events to encourage voters to de-register from the party. And as delegates streamed past the perimeter for the speeches, a contingent of anti-Clinton protesters shouted at the gates, \u201cHell no, DNC, we won\u2019t vote for Hillary!\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus ripped Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech Thursday as \"merely a litany of platitudes\" that glossed over critical issues facing the country. \"Time and again, Hillary Clinton\u2019s dishonesty and cronyism have proved she is the wrong person to lead our country as president,\" Priebus said in a statement. \"The American people have had enough of the corruption, the deceit, and the stonewalling which have been the hallmarks of her entire career.\"",

            "article_content": "Alicia Acuna reports Will Donald Trump's immigration message make him vulnerable in the traditionally red state of Arizona? Hillary Clinton's campaign has been fighting for the western prize despite a Trump lead in the polls. The America's Election Headquarters 2016 Scorecard rates Arizona as leaning Republican and eleven Electoral votes at stake. \u00a0The Real Clear Politics average in Arizona shows Trump 46% and Clinton 42%. Clinton has a strong ground game advantage that started early, including more than 30 offices in the state. The campaign has sent big hitter surrogates like First Lady Michelle Obama, Chelsea Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders to the Grand Canyon state, in addition to running mate Senator Tim Kaine. Yet, only one Democrat, Bill Clinton, has carried the state since Harry Truman did in 1948. Throughout the race, Trump has made immigration a cornerstone, hot button issue. Border state Arizona has the fifth-highest number of eligible Hispanic voters in all of the states and it's estimated the Latino vote could top 20 percent for the first time. Chuck Coughlin, political analyst and president of HighGround Public Affairs Consultants in Phoenix, says, \"The very simplistic rhetoric that you hear from the Trump campaign about build the wall, ship 'em home, it just doesn't resonate with Arizona voters by and large. It resonates with about 30 percent of the Republican base.\" Republicans have an advantage in voter registration but had been under-performing by 2 to 3 percent, according to a recent post by HighGround. The GOP appears to be making up for it after a week of solid returns and turnout effort. HighGround also says turnout among independents and unaffiliated voters has been slightly lower, adding, \"There are a few explanations that might fit: \u00a0perhaps it is because they tend to vote later or maybe it is that no one has a concentrated turnout drive just focused on independents.\" If the election results are mixed on the East Coast and all eyes turn to this Western battleground, how secure is the vote? \u00a0This past summer the state was a target of what's believed to be a foreign entity that tried unsuccessfully to hack the state's voter database. Secretary of State of the State of Arizona Michele Reagan told Fox News, \"It'd be very, very hard to rig the vote itself and we'd be able to back it up with those paper audit trails.\" \u00a0For example, voting machines and results do not transmit over the internet. The secretary, who just recently met with federal counterterrorism officials said, \"False information and fake information, is just as dangerous as hacking election systems and so we're really on guard for that and we're really watching our systems as well. \u00a0That's probably my biggest fear, much bigger than the vote itself being hacked.\"",

            "article_content": "Campaign surrogate and former congressman Pete Hoekstra explains why on 'America's Newsroom' Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in what was billed as a major foreign policy address, on Monday backed off past threats to withdraw from the NATO alliance -- saying that if he's elected, the U.S. will work with the 28-member bloc to defeat the Islamic State. During his speech in Youngstown, Ohio, Trump called for working \"very closely with NATO,\" describing radical Islamic terrorism as the dominant global threat and one that must be confronted at all levels. In doing so, Trump acknowledged having previously described NATO as \"obsolete\" for not dealing adequately with terrorism. \"Since my comments, they have changed their policy,\" Trump said, calling this apparent development \"very, very good.\" Trump's latest NATO comments indeed mark a turnaround from warnings that if he's president, the U.S. might not come to the aid of alliance members if they are attacked by Russia or another country. Those remarks, made earlier this summer, drew heavy criticism from not only from Democrats and Republicans but also from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \u201cI will not interfere with the U.S. election campaign, but what I can do is say what matters for NATO. Solidarity among allies is a key value for NATO,\u201d Stoltenberg said. Part of the NATO treaty established in 1949 requires that if one member nation is attacked, all the other nations must come to that country\u2019s defense. Trump also on Monday called for an American policy shift, vowing to focus resources on stopping the spread of radical Islam. \u201cIf I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end,\u201d Trump said. The Republican presidential nominee noted he opposed the Iraq war more than a decade ago, while blaming what he called the \"disastrous\" decisions of President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his 2016 rival, for the spread of radical Islamic terror. \u201cWe cannot let this evil continue,\u201d Trump said of the radical Islam threat. During his speech Trump proposed \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and visitors to the United States, vowing once more to block those who sympathize with extremist groups or don't embrace American values. He said the policy would first require a temporary halt in immigration from dangerous regions of the world. \"We can never choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies,\u201d Trump said. Ahead of Trump's address, Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden vigorously challenged the Republican nominee's preparedness to be commander in chief. Biden called Trump's views \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and warned that Trump's false assertions last week about President Obama founding the Islamic State could be used by extremists to target American service members in Iraq. \"The threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks,\" he said. While Trump has been harshly critical of Obama's handling of the threat posed by the Islamic State, his own policies for defeating the group remain vague. His most specific prescriptions Monday centered on changing U.S. immigration policy to keep potential attackers from entering the country. Trump's campaign aides said a new ideological test for admission to the United States would vet applicants for their stance on issues like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights. The government would use questionnaires, social media, interviews with friends and family or other means to determine if applicants support American values like tolerance and pluralism. The U.S. would stop issuing visas in any case where it cannot perform adequate screenings. Trump did not clarify how U.S. officials would assess the veracity of responses to the questionnaires or how much manpower it would require to complete such arduous vetting. Nor did the campaign say whether additional screenings would apply to the millions of tourists who spend billions of dollars visiting the United States each year. Trump also slammed Clinton, saying she lacks the \"mental and physical stamina\" to take on ISIS. He said destroying the terror group would be the centerpiece of his foreign policy and he would partner with any countries that share that goal -- specifically singling out Russia as a nation the U.S. could have a better relationship with. The Republican nominee's foreign policy address comes during a rocky stretch for his campaign. He's struggled to stay on message and has consistently overshadowed his policy rollouts, including an economic speech last week, with provocative statements, including his comments falsely declaring that Obama was the \"founder\" of the Islamic State. Trump spent much of the speech building a case that Obama and Clinton are to blame for the creation of the terror group that has roiled the Middle East and carried out attacks in the West. He specifically highlighted the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011, arguing the move created a vacuum for terror groups to thrive. Reiterating a favorite criticism of Republicans, Trump also panned the Obama administration for not using the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" to describe sympathizers. Obama, Clinton and top U.S. officials have warned against using that kind of language to describe the conflict, arguing that it plays into militants' hands. Trump's immigration proposals were the latest version of a policy that began with his unprecedented call to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from entering the country -- a religious test that was criticized across party lines as un-American. Following a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June, Trump introduced a new standard, vowing to \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\" That proposal raised numerous questions that the campaign never clarified, including whether it would apply to citizens of countries like France, Israel, or Ireland, which have suffered recent and past attacks. Trump had promised to release his list of \"terror countries\" soon. But aides say the campaign needs access to unreleased Department of Homeland Security data to assess exactly where the most serious threats lie. Clinton pre-empted Trump\u2019s speech at a rally earlier Monday with Vice President Biden in Scranton, Pa., where she claimed Trump often \u201chas no plan\u201d when it comes to foreign affairs. She also criticized him, before he softened his rhetoric on NATO, for past comments questioning America\u2019s NATO commitments, accusing him of discussing \u201cwalking away from our European allies.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The GOP nominee called the opportunity a very productive meeting; Carl Cameron with the Republican roundup for 'Special Report' Donald Trump said Wednesday that he shared his concerns personally with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto about trade and illegal immigration \u2013 calling anew for changes to NAFTA and asserting the \u201cright\u201d to build a border wall \u2013 during a surprise visit to Mexico just hours before he is set to deliver an immigration policy speech in Arizona. The Republican presidential nominee visited Mexico at Pena Nieto\u2019s invitation. The two leaders met privately in Mexico City, before they addressed the press together. \u201cWe had a very substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas,\u201d Trump said. Trump, who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign, called the issue a \"humanitarian disaster\" that must be solved. As for perhaps his most controversial proposal on the matter -- building a border wall, and making Mexico pay for it -- Trump said they touched on the issue in their meeting, though he did not insist Wednesday that Mexico foot the bill. \u201cWe did discuss the wall. We didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall,\u201d Trump told reporters, while saying either country has a \"right\" to build such a barrier. After the meeting, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto tweeted that he made it clear \"that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" The Trump campaign responded saying the meeting was \"not a negotiation\" and that it would have been \"inappropriate\" to bring up the candidate's proposal to build a wall along the border. Trump, standing next to Pena Nieto during joint remarks, also said he shared his \"strong view\" that NAFTA has helped Mexico more than the U.S. and must be overhauled. Both leaders assumed a measured and respectful tone at the podium that set aside the tensions that have emerged over the past year's U.S. presidential campaign. Pena Nieto, speaking through a translator, said their neighboring countries will face \u201ccommon challenges\u201d no matter who is the next president and urged a relationship based on \u201cmutual respect.\u201d The Mexican president said he and Trump had an \u201copen\u201d discussion, acknowledging the countries face a \u201cjoint challenge\u201d on their shared border \u2013 he said this includes addressing the flow of weapons into Mexico, as well as the flow of illegal immigrants heading north. He told Trump: \u201cWe might disagree on several issues, but your presence here \u2026 shows that we do have fundamental common ground.\u201d The meeting, which was ridiculed by the Hillary Clinton campaign, comes after Trump has spent much of the presidential race railing against illegal immigration. He has singled out Mexico, accusing the country of sending over criminals and rapists. His rhetoric, coupled with calls for a border wall and mass deportations, have stoked tensions with Latino voters and Mexican government officials \u2013 even as Trump lately has signaled potential changes in his immigration policy platform, which he expects to address in detail at a rally in Phoenix on Wednesday night. Those tensions flared as Trump was en route to Mexico City. Former President Vicente Fox told CNN that Trump is \u201cnot welcome\u201d by the Mexican people, calling it a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d Trump fired back on Twitter, saying Fox \u201cinvited me when he apologized for using the \u2018f bomb,\u2019\u201d referring to when Fox said he wasn't going to pay for \"that f-----g wall.\" The Trump-Nieto meeting was only announced Tuesday night, stoking speculation over what both men hoped to achieve. Earlier in the day, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the two would discuss illegal immigration, trade and drugs. Trump running mate Mike Pence said they would begin a conversation about a proposed border wall, along with other issues. \u201cHe\u2019s going to begin a dialogue with Mexico on issues \u2026 that we differ on \u2026 but also, issues of common interest,\u201d Pence told Fox News. \u201cI think today is more about a relationship,\u201d Pence said. The visit comes as Trump looks to clarify his stance on immigration. Trump has called for the deportation of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. and building a wall along the Mexican border, while having Mexico pay for it. Recently, Trump has signaled he may soften his stance a bit after meetings with Hispanic leaders. Conway said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Trump wants to find \u201cthe fair and humane way\u201d to address the issue. Last week, Pena Nieto \u2014 who has been critical of Trump's insistence that Mexico would pay for the wall \u2014 invited both the Republican nominee and Democrat Hillary Clinton to visit his country. Trump confirmed on Twitter late Tuesday that he had accepted Pena Nieto\u2019s invitation. Clinton, though, took a shot at Trump\u2019s trip during an address earlier Wednesday to the American Legion convention in Cincinnati. \u201cIt certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat is not how it works.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign also said in a statement that Trump\u2019s trip to Mexico ultimately doesn\u2019t matter in the long run. \"From the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as 'rapists\u2019 and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and U.S. citizens. He has said we should force Mexico to pay for his giant border wall.\u00a0 ... What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.\" A senior campaign official told Fox News that Clinton will meet with Pena Nieto at the \"appropriate time.\" Trump was already out West on Tuesday for a campaign stop near Seattle, giving him enough time to jet down to Mexico for a brief visit before his evening speech on Wednesday. Foreign trips by presidential candidates, even to a neighboring country such as Mexico, are an enormous logistical and security undertaking. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a close Trump adviser, has been among those pushing Trump to make the trip, according to a person familiar with their conversations. Christie made his own successful trip to Mexico City in September 2014, and has a warm relationship with the Mexican president. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee weighs in on his blunt remarks and campaign strategy on 'The O'Reilly Factor' Donald Trump recently canceled a campaign appearance planned for Upstate New York on Thursday, the latest sign he is backing away from his initial intention to contest states that have not been in play for a generation. Reports from the Trump camp suggest the Republican nominee for president will concentrate almost exclusively on Pennsylvania, Ohio, and one or two other states that would deliver an Electoral College victory by the barest of margins in November. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense to focus on just those three states,\" said a political expert. On the surface, it makes some sense. Why waste time in a state like New York, which he is never going to win, when every vote in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida will have outsized influence over the outcome? But there is a danger in writing off most of the country this early in the campaign. \"As much as I would tell you I'd like it, for obvious reasons because it'd be paying attention to my state, I do think that it doesn't make a lot of sense to focus on just those three states,\" said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College. \"There may be a wider path.\" While his GOP primary opponents built traditional campaigns focused on winning endorsements from local leaders and building voter-turnout operations, Trump flew above them, dominating the field with wall-to-wall media coverage everywhere he went. Replicating that strategy would be harder in a general election, where airtime will be more balanced. Still, with the modern national media landscape, Trump can reach any audience he wants -- wherever he speaks. With the modern national media landscape, Trump can reach any audience he wants -- wherever he speaks. So while it makes sense to air campaign ads in vote-rich swing states and make plenty of visits to them, Trump can address the job anxiety concerns of working-class voters in Pennsylvania just as easily while addressing an audience in Milwaukee as he can in Pittsburgh. Voters worried about Syrian refugees and terrorism in Florida will get Trump's message even if he is talking to voters in Maine. One of the few clear advantages Trump enjoys over Hillary Clinton is his willingness to make himself accessible to the media. While Clinton is reluctant to subject herself to questioning from the press, preferring situations she can tightly control, Trump rarely turns down interviews or ducks questions. While that sometimes gets him in trouble, it could allow him to dominate Clinton in local and regional media outlets. That advantage would largely be neutralized if he spends most of his time in two or three states. Democrats have a built-in advantage: The party has won 18 states with 242 Electoral College votes in every election since 1992. That puts Clinton 28 shy of victory. Most experts believe Trump must turn Florida and Ohio, which -- assuming he wins the states that Mitt Romney carried in 2012 -- would put him within 17 votes of the magic number. Several battleground states have trended more Democratic since 1992. But Pennsylvania has , making the Keystone State and its 20 votes an attractive target. Madonna said while it makes little sense for Trump to burn unnecessary resources in California or New York, he should not foreclose alternatives to Pennsylvania, which last voted Republican in a presidential election in 1988. He noted that Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Colorado -- all states where Republicans have been competitive or Trump has polled well -- have more electoral votes combined than the Keystone State. \"I don't know that you need to be a genius to figure this out,\" he said. Candice Nelson, academic director of the Campaign Management Institute at American University in Washington, said Trump's narrower focus may be a concession to finances. Clinton has dramatically out-raised Trump and had more than twice as much money on hand at the end of June than he did, according to campaign finance reports. \"It may be a resource question,\" she said. \"He may have thought expanding the map was a good idea but then realized he doesn't have the finances.\" By all accounts, Trump got a late start in building a first-rate campaign organization at the state level. It is logical to focus those efforts on the handful of make-or-break states. Nelson it would be easy and relatively inexpensive to add additional campaign stops to the itinerary if opinion shifts. \"He could do that later on if it looks like states that are not in play are coming into play,\" she said. Nelson said voters in many states are used to not seeing campaign ads and other activity. But Trump will raise eyebrows if he skips states that are accustomed to highly visible presidential campaigns, she said. \"If a state that saw a lot of activity suddenly didn't, they might wonder why,\" she said.

            "article_content": "FILE - April 28, 2016: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Costa Mesa, Calif. (AP) Donald Trump shocked pundits (and many political experts) Wednesday by winning the presidency. But his followers weren\u2019t shocked at all. They understood from the start the power of Trump\u2019s message, and the anger of middle class Americans. Americans suffering from stagnant wages and lost jobs, who were the last to benefit from the liberal agenda of Barack Obama. Americans fed up with the self-serving Washington political establishment, the crony capitalism and the insufferable political correctness stifling our workplaces and our universities. Americans tired of the intellectual elites who look down on flag waving and old-fashioned patriotism and consider themselves morally superior. Deplorables to Clinton: take that! A clear majority wanted to set the country on a new direction, and Donald Trump promised to do just that. He promised to Make America Great Again, and they believed him. Even as the returns flowed in, the results appeared to shock the mainstream media commentators reporting on the vote. They didn\u2019t expect blue collar workers in Ohio to flow to Trump; they couldn\u2019t believe that union voters, such predictable backers of Democrats historically, would line up in the red column. Where have these people been? This has been the bedrock of Trump\u2019s support. People didn\u2019t flood those huge Trump rallies because of rock stars like Jay Z or Lady Gaga; they turned out because Trump was saying what they longed to hear. They cheered when Trump said he would revamp our trade policies to protect U.S. workers. They liked that he promised to close our borders and reestablish the rule of law. They especially applauded his pledge to take on the corrupt elites in Washington and to push for term limits. The pundits expected Hispanics to hand several swing states to Clinton; while turnout was only modestly higher with the Latino community, Trump appears to have done about as well as Romney did with that community. That was unexpected. Maybe next time Democrats should try to speak to the whole country, and stop slicing and dicing the electorate. Stronger together indeed! Here\u2019s what else happened in the 2016 election: voters decided to put the Clintons and their greedy corruption out to pasture. Clinton had everything going for her: a compliant media, a popular president in her corner, over a billion dollars in campaign fund and a well-organized party apparatus. At the end, none of it mattered. Clinton had no message and no vision. She wandered as a candidate, portraying herself alternately as a benevolent grandma, a firebrand progressive and a champion of women and children. In the closing weeks of the campaign she was the angry, shrill prude offended by Donald Trump\u2019s lewd remarks about women, while at the same time lauding Jay Z\u2019s foul lyrics. There is noting genuine about Mrs. Clinton. She is a hypocrite and she is dishonest, and the voters know it. Clinton apologists will blame FBI Director James Comey for the loss, they will blame Vladimir Putin; they will say she lost because she is a woman. None of it is true. Hillary was a terrible candidate. There will be enormous handwringing in both parties over the incredible success of Donald Trump. Pundits will dredge up any number of abstruse rationales for how Trump overcame long odds and humiliated both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. It\u2019s not that complicated. Average Americans, the men and women who work hard and play by the rules, decided to make their voices heard. Now comes the hard part. Trump will have to flesh out a thoroughly undernourished organization and quickly find the people who can carry out his agenda. The media will be gunning for him; impatient voters who took a chance on an untested leader may not have much patience. Trump promised to quickly convene a special session of Congress and demand that they repeal and remodel ObamaCare. It is a brilliant idea. Imagine how excited the country would be to see actual progress. Maybe this will be the next shocker; Donald Trump might turn out to be a good president.",

            "article_content": "With more than 20 candidates on the presidential field right now, campaigns are doing whatever it takes to raise money, win followers -- and get noticed. And in the niche market of campaign merchandise, that means bizarre is better. The campaigns, to be sure, are offering the run-of-the-mill bumper stickers and T-shirts to supporters who want to fly the flag of their candidate of choice. But the campaigns also are selling an array of unusual knick-knacks, ranging from the cheap to the outrageously expensive. Here are some of the more colorful examples from the campaign stores of 2016 contenders: --------- Donald Trump The highlight of the Trump store has to be the campaign cap -- sported by the candidate himself on a recent trip to the border with Mexico. It's labeled as a \"best seller.\" The campaign is offering up \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d pom poms, for $12.50. But if the real estate mogul\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t loud enough for you already, Trump is giving supporters the opportunity to make it even louder with their very own mini-megaphone ($8). And to really complete the package, the campaign is offering up \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d pom poms, for $12.50. \"Give me a T.\" --------- Jeb Bush The Bush campaign is selling a $75 \u201cGuaca Bowle.\u201d The younger Bush brother has very publicly been reaching out to the Hispanic community as part of his presidential campaign. He took his embrace of the culture to another level by selling a $75 \u201cGuaca Bowle.\u201d However, as the website apologetically points out, \u201cJeb\u2019s secret guacamole recipe not included\u2026yet.\u201d We can only hope. Bush's campaign store is also selling a vintage tank top ($20). The campaign store is also selling a vintage tank top ($20). The emblazoned image is of the former Florida governor \u2013 sporting what the site describes as \u201ca sideburn-mustache combo that would make Burt Reynolds blush.\u201d\u00a0It's an unlikely addition to the retro chic style of clothing. Urban Outfitters beware. Meanwhile, to those upset at the shots being taken at the Bush family by other candidates, you can pick up a shirt ($25) with a quote from Jeb defending his father, in which he says Bush 41 \"is the greatest man I've ever known\" and if you don't agree \"we can step outside.\" --------- Rand Paul The outspoken Kentucky senator may be struggling\u00a0in the polls, but Paul's store has a plethora of merchandise for the loyal Paul supporter \u2013 though some cost a pretty penny. But who said liberty was cheap? The priciest item in all the stores came from the Paul camp \u2013 a copy of the Constitution, signed by the Kentucky senator, for $1,000. The priciest item in all the candidates' stores came from the Paul camp \u2013 a copy of the Constitution, signed by the Kentucky senator, for $1,000. Hillary Clinton\u2019s \"hard drive,\" referring to the email scandal currently plaguing the Democratic frontrunner, is for sale for just under $100. On a budget? Then why not try a signed eye chart \u2013 Paul is an eye doctor \u2013 which will only set you back $500. \"Grill-ary Clinton\" apron ($20), complete with catchphrase \u201camirite?\u201d The less expensive items, though, are the cheekier ones. Hillary Clinton\u2019s \"hard drive,\" referring to the email scandal currently plaguing the Democratic frontrunner, is for sale for just under $100. Don\u2019t worry, says the Paul camp, it comes completely wiped clean ... And then there's the Rand Paul \"NSA Spy Cam Blocker\" for your computer's webcam. Plastic privacy at last. --------- Hillary Clinton The Clinton pantsuit \u2026T-shirt ($30). Speaking of the former secretary of state, the Clinton campaign has its own set of merch for Hillary backers, with one of the largest campaign stores out there. The former Arkansas governor gets in on the act with a comic-book style T-shirt, labeled  \u201cDefeat the Clinton machine\u201d ($19). Having a summer BBQ? Why not show support for the former first lady with a \"Grill-ary Clinton\" apron ($20), complete with young person\u2019s catchphrase \u201camirite?\u201d And to help that hot dog go down, the store is selling a \u201cChill-ary Clinton\u201d koozie pack ($10) for the beverage. Don\u2019t fear young people, it still has the \u201camirite\u201d in there, to keep your street cred hotter than your drink. Like other candidates, the Clinton camp isn\u2019t above a bit of self-mockery, so behold \u2013 the Clinton pantsuit \u2026T-shirt ($30). --------- Mike Huckabee The Texas senator takes a tongue-in-cheek swipe at his right-wing credentials with a bumper sticker that says \u201cThis vehicle makes right turns only\u201d ($10). The former Arkansas governor gets in on the act with a comic-book style T-shirt, labeled\u00a0 \u201cDefeat the Clinton machine\u201d ($19). --------- Ted Cruz The Texas senator takes a tongue-in-cheek swipe at his right-wing credentials with a bumper sticker that says \u201cThis vehicle makes right turns only\u201d ($10). --------- Scott Walker Finally, the Wisconsin governor gets in on Rand Paul\u2019s act of selling signed items, selling signed yard signs for a relatively reasonable $75 a pop.",

General Assembly, called Tuesday for more global cooperation especially in helping refugees from war-torn countries \u2013 while making only passing reference to the Islamic State and the ever-expanding scourge of like-minded terror groups. The president called for a \u2018course correction\u2019 for globalization to ensure nations don't retreat into a more sharply divided world, while pushing back against an isolationist approach gaining popularity in many countries. He advocated for open democracies and open economies, while railing against the example set by Russia and calling for more tolerance in all nations. He also took what appeared to be a jab at Donald Trump, saying: \u2018The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall\u2019 and prevent extremism from affecting societies. With that message in hand, Obama urged nations to \u2018follow through even when the politics are hard,\u2019 in helping refugees fleeing conflict.\u201dTRUMP: U.S. MILITARY \u2018GANG THAT COULDN\u2019T SHOOT STRAIGHT\u2019 Donald Trump took American forces in Syria to task, calling the U.S. military \u201cthe gang that couldn\u2019t shoot straight\u201d over an airstrike on ISIS targets that also mistakenly killed a number of Syrian troops. In an interview Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump seemingly sided with the Kremlin on what has become a hot-button issue for U.S.-Russia relations, lamenting that \u201cRussia is absolutely furious at us.\u201d The strike marked the first known U.S. action against Putin-backed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s troops.FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH SAID TO BE VOTING AGAINST TRUMPBaltimore Sun: \u201cFormer Maryland Lt. Gov.\u00a0Kathleen Kennedy Townsend\u00a0said in a social media post on Monday that former President George H. W.\u00a0Bush\u00a0told her he is planning to break with his party to support Democrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0in November. \u2018The President told me he\u2019s voting for Hillary!!\u2019 Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and the eldest daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, wrote on Facebook under a picture of her shaking the president\u2019s hand. The post appears to have been removed since Politico first reported about it\u00a0on Monday night. Asked by The Baltimore Sun to confirm the exchange on Tuesday, Kennedy Townsend emailed back a single sentence: \u2018What was said was said.\u2019 \u2026Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush, said in a statement that the president is not commenting on the race. \u2018The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,\u2019 he said.\u201dTrump praises Christie despite new scandal claims - Donald Trump is sticking by Gov. Chris Christie even in light of allegations the New Jersey governor knew of the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. At Monday\u2019s trial of two former members of Christie\u2019s administration, prosecutors rejected Christies public claim that he had been in the dark about the retributive snarling of traffic for the town of Fort Lee, N.J. -- a punishment for a mayor who refused to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection in 2013. Trump, who had previously accused Christie of lying about his ignorance, made a statement to the NYT about Christie who is now leading Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cAfter [Christie\u2019s] recent run for president, he called me to say that he would like to endorse me in that he sees a movement like he has never seen before,\u201d Trump told the paper, \u201cI was greatly honored, accepted his endorsement, and he has been a spectacular advocate ever since.\u201dTHE RULEBOOK: IT\u2019S \u2018WE THE PEOPLE\u2019 FOR A REASON\u201cThe adversaries of the Constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on [state vs. federal government]; and to have viewed these different establishments, not only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other. These gentlemen must here be reminded of their error. They must be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative may be found, resides in the people alone\u2026\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison, \u201cFederalist No. 46\u201dTIME OUT: BIRD BRAINDiscover Magazine: \u201cBirds are rapidly building their reputation as a brainy bunch, and the latest credit goes to four pigeons who can visually recognize written words. These pigeons were living in a lab in New Zealand where, over a span of two years, they learned to distinguish four-letter English words from nonsense words. For their training, a computer screen would flash words like \u2018DOWN\u2019 or \u2018GAME,\u2019 and non-words like \u2018TWOR\u2019 or \u2018NELD,\u2019 along with a star symbol. Each time the pigeons made a correct identification \u2014 pecking the word if it was a real one, or pecking the star symbol beneath a non-word \u2014 they were rewarded with a portion of wheat.\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questionsSCOREBOARD Average of national head-to-head presidential polls:\u00a0Clinton vs. Trump: Clinton +2.4 points [Polls included:\u00a0Fox News, NYT/CBS News,\u00a0Quinnipiac University,\u00a0WaPo/ABC News,\u00a0and CNN.]Average of national four-way presidential polls:\u00a0Clinton vs. Trump vs. Johnson vs. Stein: Clinton +1.2 points [Polls included:\u00a0Fox News, NYT/CBS News,\u00a0Quinnipiac University,\u00a0WaPo/ABC News, and\u00a0CNN] TURNOUT TERRORS FOR TEAM CLINTONPhilip Bump explains that even though Hillary Clinton has enjoyed a fairly consistent lead throughout this cycle she still faces the problem of getting her voters out to the polls. WaPo: \u201cHispanics turnout in presidential elections at about the rate whites turn out\u00a0in off-year\u00a0races. Only in 2012 and 2016 did black voters turn out at the same levels as white voters. That discrepancy is one reason that Republicans have recently fared better in non-presidential election years. But it's notentirely\u00a0in line with that trend, particularly given the fluctuations you see above. If college-educated women (who like Clinton) decide to stay home and white men without degrees (who love Trump) don't, that changes things, even if white voters overall are about the same percent of the electorate.\u201d Reddit post on Hillary\u2019s server being investigated - The Hill: \u201cThe House Oversight Committee is reviewing a Reddit post that alleges an IT specialist who worked on\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server sought advice on how to alter the contents of \u2018VERY VIP\u2019 emails, according to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). Meadows is the chairman of the panel\u2019s Government Operations subcommittee. \u2018The Reddit post issue and its connection to Paul Combetta is currently being reviewed by OGR staff and evaluations are being made as to the authenticity of the post,\u2019 Meadows told The Hill.

That\u2019s his way of saying that three members of the Democratic conference have already told him that they will not vote for the deal. Which three? Vulnerable Democrats Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina have been noncommittal, but Fox News First suspects that the trouble is on the left. No word as yet from Elizabeth Warren, the freshman Democrat who has taken the reins of the liberal wing of Reid\u2019s conference. Every vote Reid loses means another he will have to get from Republicans. John Boehner delivered. Can Reid? [Drucker\u2019s got the deets - Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker looks at how the deal came together.] Is eight not enough? - Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine all said they would vote for the bill and another four \u2013 Bob Corker of Tennessee, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska were undecided, but sounded like they were leaning toward voting \u201cyea.\u201d Moderates like Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seem unlikely to filibuster the budget deal, so what is Team Reid hinting at? Do they need more? Lawmakers return to town today to start jawboning the deal in person. Fight! Fight! Fight! - How did Team Boehner sell the small-beer budget deal? The promise of fights still to come. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., says the Feb. 7 debt-limit battle will be consequential. \u201cWe don\u2019t want \u2018nothing\u2019 out of the debt limit.

[\u201cFor those of us who believe the federal government is too big, too intrusive, too involved in our lives, what [the budget deal] tells us is that if we want a budget deal we can wrap our arms around, we're going to have to win in the 2014 election\u2026Things are much different a year from now if Republicans are in charge of the Senate.\u201d \u2013 Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d] OBAMACARE NAVIGATORS NOT TRAINED, COMMITTING FRAUD - A House Government and Oversight Committee report, first obtained by Breitbart has found, \u201cObamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.\u201d VAST MAJORITY BELIEVE OBAMACARE WILL HARM THEM - Most Americans feel that ObamaCare will make their own care worse. The latest AP/GfK poll finds nearly four in five respondents see their policies changing for the worse under ObamaCare. Another 69 percent expect their premiums to go up, with another 59 percent bracing for a rise in deductibles. About sixty percent of respondents not approving of the way President Obama is handling healthcare. Generation gap - The latest from the USAToday/Pew poll shows Millennials still souring on President Obama and his signature law. Fifty-four percent of young people disapproved of his signature entitlement program. Obama\u2019s job approval with adults under 30 clocked in at 46 percent, down from 67 percent a year ago. Fox News has more. Looked good on paper - Daily Caller reports well over 50,000 paper applications for ObamaCare have yet to be processed. The government has taken on an outside contractor to assist in the backlog. Nearly 100,000 paper applications have been processed with consumers just recently finding out the results. Officials have now resorted to calling these individuals, encouraging them to sign up online. The paper applications do not actually enroll individuals in ObamaCare but merely determines their eligibility. [The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conceded over the weekend that 15,000 ObamaCare transactions were either not recorded or had errors. A spokesperson attributed the problem to \u201clarger technical system issues.\u201d The total number of corrupted transactions is not known. The issues could result in thousands believing they have coverage facing a gap on Jan. 1.] BRITS FURIOUS OVER BOTCHED CARE - A series of damning reports about the quality and availability of care under Britain\u2019s National Health Service have brought that nation\u2019s government-run health system to political center stage. As the Daily Mail reports, the topic is usually off limits to politicians owing to the sacrosanct status of universal care. But as the body count rises from hospital botches and patients grow frustrated with the inability to get doctors, politicians are gingerly picking up the topic. Among the stunning revelations: Nearly a quarter of expectant mothers were abandoned by their midwives. Another study found deadly, egregious mistakes made on a regular basis in the nation\u2019s hospitals. A survey also shows that families have mostly given up on securing appointments with their doctors. Public confidence in the system has plunged to record lows as the government is seeking to address the issue. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said that NHS staff often confided in him about poor care. FOURNIER: THE DEVOLUTION OF OBAMA - Ron Fournier considers a recent WaPo report about the administration delaying controversial rules ahead of the 2012 election for National Journal. Fournier offers this scathing criticism, \u201cThe Obama White House put politics before governing in 2012, lied about it, and still won't own up to it...Obama's apologists will say that every president plays politics with policy in elections years. Two problems with that. First, Obama promised to be better than the status quo. Second, he's worse.\u201d MCCAIN IN THE UKRAINE - Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., join the tug-of-war over the Ukraine this weekend. The senators traveled to Kiev to rally with hundreds of thousands of protesters against President Viktor Yanukovich. \u201cThese people love the United States of America, they love freedom, and I don\u2019t think you could view this as anything but our traditional support for people who want free and democratic society,\u201d McCain said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. Protesters have been rallying since November after Yanukovich refused to sign a European Union agreement, opting for closer ties with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia instead. WaPo has the story. \u2018We\u2019re not mad, we just want to talk\u2026\u2019 - The head of the National Security Administration task force investigating leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden, says he would be open to brokering a deal with Snowden. Rick Ledgett told CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he would consider a deal with Snowden over the remaining\u00a0documents he hasn\u2019t leaked. Russia has granted asylum to Snowden.\u00a0 Snowden has said he would return to the U.S. if he is granted amnesty. BAIER TRACKS: SCROOGES? - \u201cIs the Federal Reserve dialing back for Christmas?\u00a0 The WSJ polled (sorry, paywalled) the members of the central bank\u2019s board and found growing readiness to \u2018taper.\u2019 This could be the first sign that the Fed will really start to dial back its purchase of Treasury bonds flooding money into the US economy \u2013 about $85 billion a month.

            "article_content": "Republican nominee delivers immigration policy speech in Arizona Donald Trump, fresh off a hastily arranged visit to Mexico where he met with the country's president, doubled down Wednesday night on his vow to build a \"great wall\" along the southern border -- and make Mexico pay for it -- while outlining a more focused mission for the deportation force he's promised to create. In a speech in Phoenix meant to clarify his immigration positions after appearing to soften his stance, the Republican presidential nominee outlined a hardline set of proposals for tackling illegal immigration. He did not, however, definitively call for removing all illegal immigrants in the country. Rather, Trump vowed to focus first on deporting the estimated 2 million \"criminal aliens\" on day one, while also prioritizing certain groups like gang members and visa overstays for removal. He said, though, that any illegal immigrant could be subject to deportation under his administration. \"There will be no amnesty,\" he said, adding that no illegal immigrant would be legalized without first leaving and coming in through the front door. \"For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal\u00a0status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply\u00a0for reentry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration\u00a0system I outlined above,\" he said. Trump said that America\u2019s current immigration system \u201cserves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians.\" \u201cLet me tell you who it does not serve, it does not serve you the American people. It doesn\u2019t serve you,\u201d he said. In his speech, Trump also promised to end \"catch and release,\" to increase the number of ICE and border patrol agents, block funding for sanctuary cities, and create a deportation task force that he said would be focused on deporting criminal aliens. He also promised to cancel President Obama's \"illegal\" executive actions, and to enforce current immigration laws and accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of not having a plan on immigration, saying she would give \"ObamaCare, Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\" When he talked about deporting criminal aliens who had \"evaded justice,\" he also said Clinton had evaded justice. \"Maybe they'll be able to deport her too,\" he quipped. He told the crowd that there are some immigrants who will be unable to assimilate into American society. \u201cIt\u2019s our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us,\u201d he said. Amid rumors he was considering softening his trademark position on building a wall on the southern border, Trump made his position very clear. \"We will build a great wall along the southern border,\" he said to cries of \"build the wall\" from the boisterous crowd. \"And Mexico will pay for the wall.\" He later said the wall would be \"impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful.\" Trump\u2019s speech comes after he met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto earlier in the day and asserted America\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to build a border wall during a hastily arranged visit to Mexico City. While both leaders adopted a measured and respectful tone, with Trump calling it a \"substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas,\" there was disagreement on the question of the wall. While Trump told reporters \u201cwe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall,\u201d Pena Nieto later contradicted Trump and said the subject was among those discussed. He also tweeted that he made it clear \"that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" Trump has been accused of stoking tensions on the subject ever since he announced his campaign in June of last year in which he accused Mexico of not sending their best people across the border. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\u201d he said. In recent weeks, Trump has been accused of softening his tone on the subject, and had been forced to clarify whether he favored a path to citizenship for those here legally, and whether he still planned to build a wall.

            "article_content": "Reaction to the president's message, ties to 2016 election The war in Syria has been ravaging on for five years and six months producing four million refugees, 400,000 deaths and a growing threat to regional peace and security. Despite President Obama\u2019s pronouncements of concern, his U.N. Ambassador\u2019s consistent tweeting about the violence and death, his 60 plus nation coalition and his secretary of state\u2019s flurry of diplomatic meetings, the president of the United States has been unable to make real progress towards peace or even stability. President Obama is having a hard time with candidate Obama\u2019s promises to end all wars, not start any new ones and bring all U.S. troops home. In other words, candidate Obama\u2019s grandiose commitments from 2008 are running smack into President Obama\u2019s intelligence briefings. A few weeks before his re-election in 2012, Obama promised that his political calculus would change if he saw that the Syrian government was using chemical weapons in the war.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, the United Nations confirmed that the Syrian government and military was indeed gassing their own people. Four years after his re-election eve campaign promise, Obama hasn\u2019t followed through on his promise to protect the Syrian people. In his eighth and final United Nations speech this week, Obama missed the opportunity to lead once again.  While thousands of international diplomats gathered in the UN General Assembly hall to hear him, the president largely ignored the Syrian conflict.  It was a glaring omission and missed opportunity to re-focus the world\u2019s attention on ISIS and Assad. \u201cFor the Syrian government to utilize chemical weapons on its people crosses a line that will change my calculus and how the United States approaches these issues,\u201d Obama said in April 2013.\u00a0 It was a statement heralded at the time by U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, who made a loud and proud commitment of her own before becoming ambassador to the U.N. that if she was ever in a position of power that she would commit to the U.N.\u2019s Responsibility to Protect doctrine, calling on powerful nations to proactively protect vulnerable people in crises. Instead, Obama has kept his original campaign promise to not send additional U.S. troops to Syria, relying instead on Kurdish forces to gather the necessary intelligence needed to run an air campaign.\u00a0 But finding the command and control center of the Islamic radical group ISIS is proving to require more than just a daily bombing campaign. Timely and consistent intelligence from the ground is the only way to pinpoint the location of the ISIS leaders and the way to avoid mistakes like the one last week where U.S. forces accidentally killed 62 Syrian government troops they had mistaken for ISIS fighters. The Kurdish forces gathering most of the U.S. intelligence, meanwhile, are being attacked by Turkey, the U.S.\u2019 NATO ally. \u201cThe rules of engagement we are required to follow don\u2019t allow us to act in the way we want to,\u201d a U.S. military planner told me.\u00a0 \u201cWe see what is needed but aren\u2019t allowed to go there.\u201d The U.S. military is the best in the world, but without the freedom to gather the necessary intelligence on ISIS, we won\u2019t be able to find them and destroy them as they move around the country. NATO and the U.N. can only be successful in fighting extremism and combatting terrorism if the U.S. is leading the strategy.\u00a0 And with Turkey fighting the Kurds, Russia defending President Bashar al Assad while the U.S. policy says Assad should go, it is clear the U.S. isn\u2019t leading. At the Democratic Convention in July, President Obama made clear that the next president of the United States would still be trying to defeat ISIS in January 2017.\u00a0 It was a stunning admission. In his eighth and final United Nations speech this week, Obama missed the opportunity to lead once again.\u00a0 While thousands of international diplomats gathered in the UN General Assembly Hall to hear him, the president largely ignored the Syrian conflict.\u00a0 It was a glaring omission and missed opportunity to re-focus the world\u2019s attention on ISIS and Assad. It\u2019s clear to even the casual foreign policy observer that President Obama has resigned to the fact that he has failed to stop ISIS and that Bashar al-Assad will still be in power when he leaves the White House.",

            "article_content": "Strategy Room: Ellen Ratner and Scott Rasmussen discuss whether Trump can lure the labor vote away from Democrats in 2016 A seemingly growing rift between union members and other factions of the Democratic Party could present an opening this year for Donald Trump \u2013 the NAFTA-hating, border wall-building Republican populist \u2013 to peel off labor voters traditionally loyal to the other side. \u201cThere has been this disconnect between private-sector, white workers and the new Democratic coalition,\u201d pollster Scott Rasmussen said, adding that unions are scrambling this year to \u201cstop the hemorrhaging.\u201d The latest evidence of a fraying Democrat-labor alliance came earlier this month, when billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer unveiled For Our Future PAC, a $50 million partnership with the AFL-CIO and public-sector unions designed to mobilize Democratic voters in key battleground states. The announcement exposed a sense of betrayal felt among some trade unionists which could redound to Trump\u2019s benefit. Union presidents, in a letter to AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, charged that the AFL-CIO has \u201cnow officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members\u201d and \u201cmoved away from us and our membership in the interest of headline-grabbing political expediency.\u201d Terry Sullivan, the president of the laborers union LIUNA, voiced his objection to \u201cthe political agenda of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,\u201d according to a letter obtained by The New York Times. The clash follows the Obama administration rejecting the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 a project labor unions backed \u2013 amid environmental and other concerns. The Steyer embrace may mark a tipping point for trade unions who have been gradually migrating to the Republican side, said Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute, who recently wrote about the \u201cGreen/Blue Divide.\u201d \u201cThis is really about how the Democratic Party is choosing to be more about the extreme environmental agenda of wealthy liberals than it is about blue-collar voters,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe AFL-CIO and the public-sector unions are increasingly becoming an almost-monolithic pro-environmentalist movement within the Democratic Party.\u201d Unlike their public-sector union counterparts, members of unions representing steelworkers, coal miners, construction workers and others are more closely aligned with the positions of the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee on immigration, international trade and Obama-era environmental regulations. Malanga noted that in recent elections, private-sector union support has been critical in securing Republican victories. In 2013, Chris Christie earned the endorsement of two dozen blue-collar unions in his New Jersey gubernatorial re-election race. Could this extend to the presidential race? Polling this season already has shown voters on both sides of the aisle willing to support the other party\u2019s nominee if their candidate of choice were to lose the primary. A recent Fox News poll showed 11 percent of Bernie Sanders voters saying they\u2019d pick Trump over Hillary Clinton. Precise data on union voter preferences is not widely available. But during the primary race in West Virginia, the West Virginia Coal Association did formally endorse the billionaire businessman. \u201cDonald Trump has consistently shown that he understands the need to stop the regulatory assault on our industries and recognizes the pain of the workers in that industry,\u201d group President Bill Raney said, adding that he speaks to leaders with coal associations in surrounding states who have similar concerns about the regulatory climate. \u201cWe have had a lot to talk about over the last eight years and about how the people of Appalachia have been sorely affected by the policies of this administration,\u201d Raney said. \u201cPeople in this area are hunting for hope and wanting to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Donald Trump is showing us that light.\u201d The AFL-CIO, for its part, is bracing for a fight. The powerful union is planning an aggressive grassroots campaign designed to reach between 5 and 6 million voters in the hope of courting would-be Trump supporters. In a March address, Trumka acknowledged Trump is tapping into \u201cvery real and very understandable anger of working people,\u201d but warned Trump also once backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (who famously waged several battles against the unions in his state) and has taken other positions he argued run counter to working-class interests. \u201cTrump says he\u2019s with the American working class, but when you look close, it\u2019s just hot air,\u201d Trumka said. Despite her issues in coal country, likely Democratic nominee Clinton enjoys widespread support from other influential unions, most recently getting the backing of United Auto Workers. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told FoxNews.com there is some potential for Trump to court union voters but called it \u201climited.\u201d \u201cIf you look at biggest [service or government] unions, Trump does very poorly because they tend to be very liberal, non-white and largely female. However, the trade unions, is where he can make some inroads,\u201d he said. The Trump campaign did not return requests for comment for this report. Pollster Rasmussen argued the simmering internecine tensions hold potential for Republicans. \u201cThis is part of an ongoing trend. It is not like it didn\u2019t exist between 2016. \u2026 Issues like immigration are a big part of it. It potentially \u2026 gives the Republicans a shot to have an impact in the Midwest,\u201d said on FoxNews.com\u2019s Strategy Room. Bernie Porn, partner and president of the Michigan polling firm EPIC-MRA, pointed to Michigan, for instance, as a state where the labor vote could drift to Trump. Exit polls showed that among voters who think international trade hurts U.S. jobs, most went for Sanders and not Clinton in the Democratic primary. Michigan hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988. Could Trump, who won the state\u2019s primary, pocket their electoral votes in November? Said Porn, \u201cWho knows, it has been a very unpredictable year so far.\u201d",

            "article_content": "hands in jail (iStock) Prisoners who practice transcendental meditation twice a day may experience less stress and fewer mental health issues than fellow inmates who don't meditate, a small U.S. study suggests. Previous research has linked this type of meditation involving mantras and mindfulness to reduced stress in a variety of populations at risk for mental health problems, including trauma victims, refugees and military veterans. For the current study, researchers offered 90 male inmates in Oregon state prisons a five-session training program in meditation then asked them to practice the techniques they learned twice daily for 20 minutes. Researchers also followed a control group of 91 inmates who didn't receive any intervention. After four months, all the men showed some improvement in symptoms, but men in the meditation group reported significantly larger reductions in perceived stress, anxiety, depression, dissociation and sleep disturbances than the inmates who didn't participate in this program, the study found. For depression and sleep problems, symptom scores were reduced by half, on average, among men who meditated, as was their total trauma score. \"This is the first randomized controlled study to confirm that transcendental meditation can substantially decrease trauma symptoms, including reducing depression and sleep problems, in prison inmates,\" said lead study author Sanford Nidich, director of the Center for Social and Emotional Health at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. The practice may have benefits for both mental and physical health, Nidich added by email. \"Elevated trauma symptoms are associated with poor lifestyle decision making and higher rates of recidivism,\" Nidich said. \"Experience of trauma exposure also is associated with adverse mental and physical health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.\" Researchers evaluated the transcendental meditation program at the Oregon State Correctional Institution, a medium-security prison, and the Oregon State Penitentiary, a maximum-security facility. Men participating in the study were 29 years old on average. Approximately 52 percent were white, 16 percent were black and 15 percent were Native American. In the treatment group, men were encouraged to meditate each morning and afternoon after completing the training program. They could also attend optional group sessions several times a week. Before treatment started, and again four months later, researchers asked participants in the meditation group and the control group to rate how often they felt stress as well as a range of symptoms associated with trauma such as sleep disturbances, depression and anxiety. While both groups experienced declines in perceived stress, men in the meditation group reported a bigger average decrease, researchers report in The Permanente Journal, online October 7th. One limitation of the study is that it isn't designed to show transcendental meditation works better than alternative treatments, only that it's better than doing nothing to help prisoners cope with stress, the authors note. \"This is quite a significant weakness of the study,\" said Bei-Hung Chang, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester who wasn't involved in the study. That said, the results suggest it's feasible to try the approach in prisons and get inmates to participate, Chang added by email. \"Meditation is a lifelong practice and regular practice is the key to maintain and deepen the effects,\" Chang said. \"As such anyone who has learned the technique should continue the practice if they want to maintain the effects and continue to improve.\" Because the study only followed inmates for four months, it's unclear how many sessions a week, over how long a period of time, would be needed to cement an effective meditation practice, noted Dr. James Stahl, a researcher at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire who wasn't involved in the study. But there may be no harm in trying, Stahl added by email. \"I think it is safe to say for those amenable to transcendental meditation that it is a safe, effective, inexpensive intervention that can have long term beneficial effects,\" Stahl said.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Akron, Ohio, Monday, Aug. 22, 2016. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) I\u2019m a woman, a racial minority, and an immigrant, and I grew up in inner-city America. I have two university degrees, one from Cornell University and another from Stanford Law School. I have worked for some of the most elite institutions in America, including a foreign policy organization that counts Chelsea and Bill Clinton among its members. According to conventional wisdom, I have no business being a Trump supporter. Yet I have been an unabashed fan since Trump declared his candidacy for president. In fact, never in my life have I been this excited about a presidential nominee. Strangers and friends alike have wondered how a highly educated Chinese-American woman could possibly support a man widely condemned as racist, sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and Islamophobic. It is not that complicated, really. I like the candidate and what he stands for, and I reject the caricature propagated by the mainstream media and his opponents. I believe this country needs bold change, not more of the same. Trump has promised to deliver. Instinctively, I recognize in Trump the key ingredients that have made success possible in my own life. As a child of the ghetto, I succeeded in extracting myself\u2014and my family\u2014from urban dysfunction and decay not just because I worked hard but because I dreamt big, took risks no one I knew would take, and kept faith in America\u2019s promise. Trump\u2019s story is wildly more successful and dramatic, but it resonates with me nonetheless. Since he declared his candidacy\u00a0 he has defied the odds, upended the political order, and dared to envision a completely different America. Certainly, he is a very flawed candidate. Recently released audio of a private conversation Trump had 11 years ago confirms him to be vulgar, narcissistic, and insecure. Before that, his endless controversies on the campaign trail revealed a man who was thin-skinned, undisciplined, and immature. Yet I believe this same man will overthrow\u2014not just tinker with\u2014the wretched political correctness that governs this country\u2019s discussions and policies about race, ethnicity, gender, and other immutable characteristics. He will fight for Americans in a way that Republicans and Democrats have long been afraid to do, and he will think big, act boldly, and choose common sense over ingrained practices. Here's why. Political Correctness I am a natural for Trump\u2019s core constituency: I have long been a card-carrying member of what Hillary Clinton calls the \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d I am \u201cdeplorable\u201d because I reject the reigning politically correct and intellectually intolerant paradigm, which mandates that women and minorities serve as tokens of diversity according to their so-called racial and gender identity. In this paradigm, I am \"deplorable\" because I dare to have a dissenting opinion. Long before Trump became a presidential contender, my support for the rule of law and opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants made me a xenophobe. My references to black-on-black crime in discussions about police-community relations made me a racist. My use of the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d made me an Islamophobe. When Trump came along, he gave me\u2014and millions others\u2014a voice. Not only does he reject this nonsense wholesale, he does so with hilarity, theater, and bombast. His undisciplined outbursts are not always pretty, but he is an equal-opportunity offender, not a stooge of the prevailing bigotry or an apologist for its fake diversity and ill-disguised pandering. Next to Trump, the Republican governing class\u2019s rejection of political correctness is merely a mealy-mouthed exercise. Over the summer, we saw the squeamishness of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.). When asked for his views on the Black Lives Matter movement, whose protestors have repeatedly called for police officers to be killed or\u00a0fried\u00a0\u201clike bacon,\u201d Ryan demurred. This is the same man who never misses an opportunity to call Trump racist and divisive. He recently announced that he will no longer campaign with or defend his party\u2019s presidential nominee. For a long time, I supported Republicans like Ryan and others who are far worse, but this year, I have a better choice. This year, my candidate does not try to ingratiate himself to the mainstream media. Instead, he slashes through the fabric of political correctness and threatens to tear down its reign. This is the type of candidate I have wanted for a long, long time. He'll Fight for Us Beyond Trump\u2019s politically incorrect rhetoric, he has demonstrated time and again that he will fight for those of us who have put our faith in him. I first noticed him when he spoke of illegal immigration and emphasized building a wall to secure our borders. He did not describe all Mexican immigrants as rapists or criminals, but it did not matter. His critics cried racism and xenophobia anyway. Yet the more they became indignant, the more I supported Trump. I am a first-generation immigration. My family came to the United States legally\u2014we submitted the relevant documentation, answered the necessary questions, waited in line for years, and followed America\u2019s laws. Yet our respect for America\u2019s rule of law is entirely irrelevant to Democrats, who are eager to hand out citizenship to illegal immigrants for political gain. Republicans, on the other hand, pretend they care about legality and sovereignty but can hardly hide their disdain for making the tough decisions required to protect both. In fact, prominent Republicans\u2014ranging from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to Speaker Ryan\u2014have proudly called for one form of amnesty or another. By contrast, Trump has little use for their rhetoric or hypocrisy. He wants to build a wall and boasts of making Mexico pay for it. It makes no difference if the latter does not materialize. Far more important is Trump\u2019s willingness\u2014and even eagerness\u2014to taunt the political class by making this promise the centerpiece of his campaign. As he has enunciated his positions on other issues, begat more indignation, and stood firm, I have supported him more forcefully. For instance, on the crucial issue of defeating terrorism and keeping the homeland safe, he has called for a ban of Muslims from terror-prone countries and for conducting extreme ideological vetting of immigrants who wish to enter this country. The response from the media and the political establishment has been loud and furious, but Trump has pressed on regardless. His proposal can certainly be fleshed out further, but it is far more sensible than the reluctance by President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to identify radical Islamic terrorism by name, or the delusion by many on the Right who think radical Islam can be cleanly and clearly separated from peaceful Islam at all times. Trump has repeatedly incurred the wrath of the political establishment, and in the process, he showed voters like me a candidate who refuses to back down and is not afraid to fight for Americans whose wishes have been long ignored. Trump Has Big Ideas and Common Sense Despite all that I like about Trump, I have found his rhetoric and positions on trade to be most difficult to swallow. I have been an ardent free trader my entire adult life. Trump, however, has called for renegotiating America\u2019s major trade agreements, such as NAFTA, and for slapping heavy tariffs on U.S. trading partners (35 percent on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on imports from China). I do not support these positions, but I understand their appeal far better than most free traders who write and talk for a living. I hail from a working class family. Some years ago, when my parents were laid off from their blue-collar jobs, I had to make a choice myself: I declined a job that I worked very hard to get and accepted one that I hated because the latter offered significantly better compensation. I believed it to be the right decision for my family; it was not. Nevertheless, my faith in free trade and free markets remains, but that faith is tempered by intimate knowledge of real Americans who have lost out in amid powerful global forces. Few politicians have bothered to speak for them; even fewer have offered viable solutions to alleviate their pain. Today, Trump is speaking for them, with gusto. While many of his pronouncements are outlandish, he is staking out opening bids to negotiations with foreign countries and Congress. The details of his positions on trade, much like his positions on the economy (consolidating five individual income tax brackets into three), immigration (making Mexico pay for the wall), and foreign policy (requiring that NATO allies pay more for collective security), are not firmly set in stone, even if the broad directions of policy have been decided. Trump has made clear that much of what he threatens is exactly that: threats that will be used to extract better deals for America. His ideas may not pan out quite as they were originally described, but his goal is to think differently, to envision better arrangements for this country in general. Unlike a typical politician, Trump is not going to confine himself to the solutions that have not worked in the past. To Americans who want a better deal for their families and their country, that is very much worth applauding. Trump Is Leading a Political Revolution I believe this country needs bold change, not more of the same. Trump has promised to deliver. Citizens across this country have placed their faith in this revolutionary candidate, despite his flaws. Hillary Clinton may think we are deplorable, but we are ordinary Americans who believe the country deserves better than business as usual. In this election, we have proudly joined the political revolution that Trump has inspired, and we are not asking Hillary, or anyone else, for permission.",

            "article_content": "Are Republicans in danger of losing majority in the House? An influential conservative group is urging the Republican-led House to postpone its looming leadership vote, potentially offering House Speaker Paul Ryan a chance to get his \u2018house\u2019 in order at a time when his detractors are renewing threats to oust him in the aftermath of the \u201cchaotic\u201d 2016 election. The Tea Party-tied FreedomWorks sent a message Monday to the House Republican Caucus telling members to wait until December to decide on a speaker. FreedomWorks leader Adam Brandon said Tuesday the push does not reflect support for Ryan; only a call for members \u201cto reassess and reflect\u201d after a \u201chistorically long, chaotic election cycle.\u201d \u201cThis is not a pro-Ryan or anti-Ryan,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cThere\u2019s just no reason to rush. It\u2019s a delicate process. Take your time and get it right.\u201d Brandon also said his group is \u201cvery close in mind\u201d to the House Freedom Caucus, a leading critic of Ryan since the chamber elected him speaker in fall 2015. But any delay in the speaker nomination could give Ryan extra time to mend a divided conference and even deliver on conservative wish list items in the lame-duck session. Brandon urged Ryan to \u201cfight for fiscal sanity and conservative priorities\u201d upon returning to Capitol Hill, especially when it comes to a government spending bill -- suggesting Ryan\u2019s political future should be tied to those results. The House leadership has given no indication it would even consider postponing such a vote. Newly elected members customarily join sitting members in November in a private session to casts the leadership votes, then have a full floor vote in January when the new Congress convenes. Republican strategist Rob Carter on Tuesday downplayed the call for a delay from FreedomWorks. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to gin up contributions. I get it. But as for the substance of it, I cannot take it seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House Republican Conference will hold its leadership vote like it always does. Paul Ryan does not lack for support from Republicans with the exception of a handful trying to disrupt.\u201d Ryan still faces a restive chamber upon his return, after a presidential race that divided Republican lawmakers and saw Ryan distancing himself from presidential nominee Donald Trump. And the challenges he confronted upon becoming speaker in October 2015 remain. As recently as last month, before Congress broke for the elections, Ryan agreed to a so-called continuing resolution to keep the government open past Dec. 31. However, he needed votes from Democrats upon losing support from the House Freedom Caucus and other fiscally conservative Republicans in the chamber, in large part because such a resolution maintains spending levels instead of cutting them. In addition, the final bill failed to include a measure to halt President Obama\u2019s plan to accept Syrian refugees or cut Planned Parenthood money in exchange for more funding to combat the Zika virus. John Boehner, the House speaker before Ryan, was effectively run out by conservatives for similarly cutting deals with Democrats to pass legislation. Ryan splitting with Trump after an audiotape surfaced of him bragging in 2005 about kissing and groping women has only increased the rift with some House members. The 30-member Freedom Caucus held a mid-October conference call in which members reportedly discussed backing an alternative to Ryan for speaker. North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus member, later told a local radio station the effort to replace Ryan is \u201cpicking up some steam.\u201d \"A lot of people who believe so desperately that we need to put Donald Trump in the White House -- they question the loyalty of the speaker,\" he said on WAAV Radio. Rank-and-file House Republicans are trying to help Ryan in case of a revolt. California Rep. Devin Nunes recently made a proposal to stop any member from trying to oust the speaker with a procedure called a \u201cmotion to vacate the chair.\u201d The motion results in a vote of no confidence that the speaker must defeat with a majority. The Nunes proposal reportedly would require majority support for the motion to be filed. Ryan has, meanwhile, continued to fulfill his promise to help Republicans this election cycle keep control of the House and Senate, while not campaigning for Trump. Supporters say Ryan remains in high demand across the country. He has so far this month attended at least 75 events across at least 17 states in support of GOP House incumbents and challengers and reportedly raised $50 million this year, with more than half going to the National Republican Congressional Committee. And in the final four days of the 2016 campaign, Ryan is expected to visit an additional four states and join incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson on a bus tour across their home state of Wisconsin. Ryan will have visited 21 states from October through early November in support of House and Senate candidates.",

            "article_content": "All-Star panel reaction to the third and final presidential debate Donald Trump on Wednesday night didn\u2019t threaten to prosecute his opponent should he win the presidency on Nov. 8. Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t spout off any obviously canned phrases for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d to mock. But there were still plenty of fireworks during the third -- and final -- presidential debate of 2016. Here are the night\u2019s top nine moments: 1. \u201cBad hombres\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, raised eyebrows during his response to a question about border security. The content of his answer wasn\u2019t surprising for anyone who\u2019s listened to Trump since he began his run for the White House -- build a wall and deport the \u201cbad, bad people in this country.\u201d But near the end of the remarks, Trump suddenly used a slang Spanish word for \u201cmen.\u201d \u201cWe have some bad hombres here and we\u2019re gonna get them out,\u201d Trump said. Social media immediately lit up with reactions, and \u201cBad Hombres\u201d was one of the top Twitter trends within minutes. The phrase had been tweeted out nearly 130,000 times by the time the debate ended. Even Clinton\u2019s digital team quickly jumped on the phrase, tweeting out \u201cHombres\u201d? #debatenight 2. \u201cOpen Borders\u201d Moderator Chris Wallace pressed Clinton on a controversial remark she made during a paid speech to a Brazilian bank shortly after she ended her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton has resisted releasing the transcripts of her so-called \u201cWall Street speeches\u201d despite pressure from her primary and general election opponents. Some of the transcripts, however, recently leaked out when WikiLeaks published a trove of stolen emails allegedly belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. \u201cWe've learned from WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, \u2018my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders,\u2019\u201d Wallace asked. Trump immediately leaned into his microphone and said \u201cThank you.\u201d Clinton said the line had been misconstrued. She said she was talking about \u201cenergy\u201d coming across borders, not illegal immigration. Trump rolled his eyes and smirked at the explanation. 3. Vladimir Putin After the topics of WikiLeaks and the Podesta hack were broached, the discussion turned toward Russia, the nation many intelligence experts believe was behind the Podesta hacking. Clinton attacked Trump for being too cozy with Russian president Vladimir Putin and said Trump would be Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet as president.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cNo puppet, no puppet. You\u2019re the puppet.\u201d After some crosstalk, Trump continued to counterpunch. \u201cShe doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her every step of the way,\u201d he said. 4. Abortion and The Supreme Court The next president might appoint as many as three Supreme Court justices, Wallace noted, a number that could influence whether the court leans left or right for an entire generation. The hot-button topic of abortion was discussed in this context, with Clinton unable to answer if she could ever support any regulation on the controversial procedure. Trump responded with one of the most passionate -- and graphic -- answers he\u2019d given during any debate. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.\u201d 5. Sexual misconduct allegations Since lewd comments Trump made on a hot mic in 2005 were revealed two weeks ago, several women have come forward with claims that Trump sexually assaulted them. Trump denied all of the charges and accused Clinton \u201cand her very sleazy campaign\u201d of being behind the stories. \u201cWell, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThose people, I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.\u201d Clinton responded: \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\u201d 6. Violence at rallies Clinton lambasted Trump for being responsible for the rhetoric that she said provoked several violent incidents during his primary and general election rallies. \u201cThis is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies,\u201d Clinton said. Trump, however, said it was Clinton who was guilty of starting the unrest. He cited an edited, undercover video released this week by a conservative activist. The footage allegedly shows Democrat operatives discussing how they have incited violence at Trump rallies. \u201cSo sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt's on tape.\u201d 7. Clinton Foundation vs. Trump Foundation Clinton and Trump traded shots about their respective namesake charity foundations, both of which have come under fire for various scandals. When Clinton initially said she was \u201cthrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Trump saw an opening. \u201cIt's a criminal enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia giving 25 million dollars. Qatar, all of these companies. You talk about women and women's rights. So these are people that push gays off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. So I'd like to ask you right now why don't you give back the money that you have taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money?\u201d Clinton retorted: \u201cAnd I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI mean, who does that?\u201d 8. Trump may not accept election results Though he said during the first presidential debate that he would accept the results of November\u2019s election whether he won or lost, Trump on Wednesday said he wasn\u2019t so sure anymore. Trump has been frequently talking during rallies about his belief that the election is \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d he said Wednesday night. \u201cI'm not looking at anything now I will look at it at the time. What I've seen is so bad.\u201d Trump also said Clinton shouldn\u2019t be eligible to run for the presidency because of her secret server scandal. Though authorities said Clinton was careless, after a lengthy investigation the FBI declined to charge her. \u201cShe's guilty of a very, very serious crime,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe should not be allowed to run...What I'm saying now is I will tell you. I will keep you in suspense, okay?\u201d 9. Rigged Following up on Trump\u2019s talk of a \u201crigged\u201d election, Clinton said the rhetoric was not only untrue, but also a tool commonly employed by the billionaire businessman. \u201cEvery time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is is rigged against him,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case. He said that the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus; he lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering. He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.\u201d After hearing Clinton\u2019s comment about the Emmy\u2019s, Trump interrupted: \u201cI should have gotten it.\u201d",

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Mexican Ranchera music legend Vicente Fernandez will campaign for presidential front runner Hillary Clinton, campaign aides told Fox News Latino. Fernandez, a musical icon to many Mexican-American households, also will hold a debate watch party in Nevada next Wednesday. Known as the \"King of Ranchera,\" Fernandez officially endorsed Clinton last month. During her Western state swing this week, which included a visit to the battleground state of Nevada, Clinton won several other influential endorsements within the Latino community, including an endorsement from Latina magazine, a publication that had not endorsed a presidential candidate in over 20 years. \"After enduring a targeted onslaught on our community by Donald Trump for the past 16 months, the stakes for Latinas has never been greater,\" the magazine announced in a statement. Another influential Hispanic group, the National Council of La Raza Action Fund, will endorse Clinton before the debate, Fox News Latino has confirmed. Recent polls show a tight race in Nevada, with Clinton opening up a four point lead over Trump in a Public Policy Polling survey released Wednesday. Clinton\u2019s campaigning in Las Vegas on Wednesday was an attempt to galvanize Latino voters in the swing state. \"Who is ready to vote in this election?\" she asked several thousand Nevada supporters. Clinton also tried to appeal to Hispanic voters by speaking of \"dreamers\" that she has encountered on the campaign trail. \"I\u2019ve met dreamers who want to start businesses, dreamers who want to go to medical or law school, who have big dreams,\" Clinton said. \"By following dreams they\u2019ll help economy.\" The last presidential debate will be held in Las Vegas on Wednesday at 9pm ET and will be moderated by Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace.

The Republican nominee once famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still stand behind him. He was kidding\u2026up to a point. The dogged support of a plurality of Republican voters propelled him through missteps that would have ended the campaigns of others and on to the GOP nomination. In large part, however, Trump\u2019s supposed apostasies in the primaries were the kinds of gaffes or intemperate statements that didn\u2019t have much to do with why so many voters surged to his side at the start of his campaign. Once you accept Trump as Trump you can get over the kinds of behavior that one would never tolerate in another politician. For instance, Trump is today mean-tweeting the hosts of a cable news morning show. But so what? If Hillary Clinton suddenly did the same thing to the hosts of \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d it would be in the news for days. At this point with Trump, though, it\u2019s just \u201cwhatevs.\u201d Verbal fisticuffs and feuds with individuals already detested by core Trump voters aren\u2019t really much of a test of loyalty, though. The two faults we are most prone to forgive in our friends are their flattery of us and their demonization of our enemies. What if it was a matter of substance? Trump\u2019s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said that the status of Trump\u2019s promised \u201cdeportation force\u201d to round up more than 10 million illegal immigrants and expel them from the United States \u201cto be determined.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty big matzo ball to have hanging out there, especially since it was the, ahem, Trump card, in the Republican primary debate over who could embrace the most draconian policy on illegal immigration. Think back to when \u201canchor babies\u201d and a lot of loose talk about amending the constitution around birthright citizenship -- including that of the junior Senator from Texas \u2013 was in the news. Other Republicans favored a version of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cself-deportation\u201d in which a secure border and internal enforcement measures would drive illegals out of the country. Trump scoffed and touted his plan to round up illegals, famously defending it by invoking \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d from 1954. If Trump were to ditch the deportation force idea, it would not be the first policy point he had walked back, most notably, keeping all Muslims from entering the United States. He then embraced the idea of banning people from countries tied to terrorism before most recently alighting on a more aggressive vetting process for individual Muslims \u2013 essentially the same thing he once decried his rivals for pursuing. That shift doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt Trump with his core supporters and was quite necessary for him to compete in the general election. Trump would be far from the first presidential candidate to \u201cEtch A Sketch\u201d a few problematic points after the primaries. In fact, Trump has advantages in this way that politicians do not. The fervent devotion to his core followers is something that we have not seen for a major party nominee in more than a generation. It\u2019s not so much that they believe him it\u2019s that they believe in him. That gives him latitude in theory to reach out to new voters. But what if the subject is the core of Trump\u2019s issue set: Cleansing America of the scourge of illegal immigrants? The nominee has previously embraced so-called \u201ctouchback amnesty\u201d in which a pathway to citizenship is provided to illegals who first returned to their home countries. So there is evidence, even beyond the Muslim ban, that Trump\u2019s base will overlook policy shifts on the topic. What remains to be seen is whether they will condone Trump reportedly starting the shift in a closed-door meeting with Hispanic leaders. One imagines that Trump\u2019s shifts on the Muslim ban would have been less well received by his base than if they had been telegraphed in private meetings with imams. Conway made her \u201cto be determined\u201d comment after the Trump campaign had vehemently denied reports from individuals in the meeting that the nominee expressed interest in a more \u201chumane and efficient\u201d way to deal with illegal immigrants than mass deportations, suggesting that there are indeed changes to come. Trump has massive advantages in his primary/general pivot that Clinton does not enjoy. Democrats remain highly suspicious of Clinton on issues like trade, national security, and yes, illegal immigration. Like Romney, Clinton will be afforded very little slack by her party\u2019s base. Trump has already enjoyed grace on a scale unknown in modern politics from his legion of followers. One would not think that this shift would be enough to cause a crisis of confidence, but more shifts will be needed. And those shifts will come against a backdrop not of primary victories but rather a tough slog of a general election campaign. In order to win, Trump must broaden, not intensify, his appeal. Given the degree to which Trump\u2019s support hinges on intense contempt for Clinton and the political system it may be enough for him just to be against her. But make no mistake, Trump\u2019s Hispanic outreach and other efforts to normalize will come at a cost to his core brand and reinforce the claim made by his former and current foes that Trump\u2019s candidacy is a \u201ccon.\u201d TIME OUT: CHEESED OFF\u00a0 The Awl: \u201cIf you were to ask a random American what he or she thinks about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), it\u2019s safe to bet they wouldn\u2019t have much to say\u2026And yet, deep within the bowels of the treaty, there\u2019s one clause that could have a profound effect on everyday American life\u200a\u2014\u200aby making it illegal for US cheese makers to use common names rooted in regional European culinary traditions like feta, muenster, or parmesan.

The New York Times\u00a0reported last week that Clinton told the FBI that Powell detailed to her his email practices under George W. Bush\u2026Powell said in a statement that he had no recollection of this conversation with Clinton and elaborated on his statement to\u00a0The New York Post, saying \u2018The truth is she was using it (her personal email) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u2019 He added that, \u2018her people have been trying to pin it on me.\u2019 Powell said it didn\u2019t bother him, according to The Post.\u201d Clinton outraises Trump in battleground states - USA Today: \u201cDemocrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton, who has raced\u00a0past\u00a0Republican\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0in the television and ground war for the presidency, also is harvesting more cash than her Republican rival from the states that could decide the election, a USA TODAY analysis of new campaign-finance reports shows. The former secretary of State outraised Trump in 10 of the 11 most competitive states last month, according to the analysis.

Neither of can recall in any statistics class (we both have master\u2019s degrees- one in economics education and one in sports medicine) the validity of said calculation. Could you provide an explanation as to why the media is fixated on this artificial number? Seems to us that the media needs a quick and dirty method to explain perceived trends. Perhaps the explanations ought to focus on a better way to explain survey bias and sample weighting.\u00a0Since we are from the \u2018land \u00a0beyond O\u2019Hare\u2019 in Illinois, we struggle daily to plow thru media manipulation of factual events. \u00a0Thanks!\u201d \u2013 Laurel and Alan Howard, West Chicago, Ill. [Ed. note: What a great question, Mr. and Mrs. Howard! Poll averages can be very helpful things, but the individual components matter.

By making a m\u00e9lange \u2013 I have compared it to a Slim Jim of polls \u2013 you control for outliers but still include polls that could be the beginning of new trends. Yummy! But, when there are too many bad ingredients it overwhelms what\u2019s good. Yuck!

The Washington Post reveals the nightmarish journey for ObamaCare enrollees who find the federal program has failed them, including some of the 22,000 people desperate enough to send their pleas off to Kentucky in hope of help.From WaPo\u2019s Amy Goldstein - \u201cFor now, the appeals are sitting, untouched, inside a government computer. And an unknown number of consumers who are trying to get help through less formal means \u2014 by calling the health-care marketplace directly \u2014 are told that HealthCare.gov\u2019s computer system is not yet allowing federal workers to go into enrollment records and change them, according to individuals inside and outside the government who are familiar with the situation.\u201dTough luck - \u201c\u2026Addie Wilson, 27, who lives in Fairmont, W.Va., and earns $22,000 a year working with at-risk families\u2026 said that she is paying $100 a month more than she should for her insurance and that her deductible is $4,000 too high\u2026. When Wilson logged on to HealthCare.gov in late December, she needed coverage right away. Her old insurance was ending, and she was to have gallbladder surgery in January. But the Web site would not calculate the federal subsidy to which she knew she was entitled. Terrified to go without coverage, Wilson phoned a federal call center and took the advice she was given: Pay the full price now and appeal later. Now she is stuck.\u201d [Minneapolis Star Tribune: \u201cAs of last week\u2026 just 475 Minnesota workers are covered on small business plans purchased through [the state\u2019s ObamaCare Web site] according to the latest figures.

Yet that is precisely what the president\u2019s health care law does. The health care law has been a disaster from the start, devastating both family budgets and the economy as a whole.

Obama spent his pre-Super Bowl interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly scrambling like Peyton Manning. Pressed by O\u2019Reilly on the administration\u2019s handling of Benghazi, the launch of HealthCare.gov and the IRS, the president appeared at times like a quarterback on a broken play, trying to minimize his losses.

For example, [a pro-Hillary political action committee] might ask a donor to pledge $1 million to the Clinton effort over the next few years, but write a check for only $100,000 this year, a person familiar with the discussion said\u2026\u201d Moooo! - Alice Walton, George Soros and Marc Benioff headline the list of billionaires making contributions to the political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton. The Washington Free Beacon has more on the cash cows that are part of Planet Hillary\u2019s fauna. She\u2019s on the record - In a letter to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton it made clear that she supports the administration\u2019s deal to allow Iran to have a nuclear program in exchange for safeguards that it will not be used to make weapons. She encouraged her former Senate colleagues to drop a bid to restore tougher sanctions: \u201cWe should give anyone watching from Tehran no reason to doubt America\u2019s unity and resolve.\u201d BORDER SECURITY COULD PUT BREAKS ON IMMIGRATION DEALWashington Examiner: \u201cRepublicans can move immigration reform forward, Rep. Paul Ryan [R-Wis.] said Sunday, but only if it puts border security before amnesty for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. \u2018This is not a trust-but-verify; this is a verify- then-trust approach,\u2019 said Ryan on ABC. The Wisconsin Republican added that \u2018we don't trust the president to enforce the law,\u2019 necessitating strong commitments from Democrats to border security measures in any immigration reform deal. Ryan specifically mentioned border security and interior security that includes a worker verification system and a visa tracking system. Those items have to be in law and independently verified before legalization can move forward, Ryan said.\u201d TICK, TICK, TICK: DEBT DEADLINE NEARSStart your countdown clocks.

Read David Drucker\u2019s dispatch from the House policy retreat to understand. \u2013 Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel to know the very latest. ABORTIONS ON DECLINE\u201cThe U.S. abortion rate declined to its lowest level since 1973, and the number of abortions fell by 13 percent between 2008 and 2011, according the latest national survey of abortion providers conducted by a prominent research institute. The Guttmacher Institute, which supports legal access to abortion, said in a report being issued Monday that there were about 1.06 million abortions in 2011 \u2014 down from about 1.2 million in 2008. Guttmacher\u2019s figures are of interest on both sides of the abortion debate because they are more up-to-date and in some ways more comprehensive than abortion statistics compiled by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the report, the abortion rate dropped to 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in 2011, well below the peak of 29.3 in 1981 and the lowest since a rate of 16.3 in 1973.\u201d More WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Forbes\u2019 John Tamny looks at lessons from the career of the coach of the newly crowned world champions in Congratulations To Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll, The NFL's Greatest Failure:\u201cAt one time he was very much seen as unsuited to the head coach role; so much so that he was unemployed. Carroll\u2019s path to football\u2019s elite was a checkered one, and it speaks to the wondrous, life enhancing value of failure as the driver of future success.

If such evidence does exist, a state panel investigating the closures has not yet seen it, Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who co-leads the probe, said on Sunday\u2026 On Friday, David Wildstein, the Christie appointee at the agency overseeing the bridge who personally oversaw the lane closures, said \u2018evidence exists\u2019 Christie had knowledge of the blockage when it happened. \u2018We don't really know what the evidence is,\u2019 Wisniewski told NBC's \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 [Wildstein] submitted over 900 pages of documents in response to the subpoena.

He spent about $147,000 in the last quarter of 2013\u2026 The information available so far shows that [Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska] ended the year with the most cash on hand, $2.8 million. Sullivan, however, raised the most money in the final months of the year.\u201d TILLIS TRIES TO STAY ABOVE THE FRAYNorth Carolina\u2019s GOP Senate frontrunner is state House Speaker Thom Tillis, a top recruit with good fundraising and no well-known primary opponents. Tillis looks to have the best shot to tackle embattled incumbent Democrat, Sen. Kay Hagan, but conservative activists are growing skeptical. Tillis needs to get 40 percent of the vote on a six-way race to avoid a runoff election. So far, he has been trying to stay above the fray. The Charlotte News and Observer checks in on that effort: \u201cIt\u2019s a careful balancing act, one that risks alienating tea party activists as he courts a GOP establishment \u2026 The strategy also allows Tillis to avoid the glare of attention, as well as tea party video cameras waiting for a gaffe or embarrassing moment. With targeted appearances and TV ads, he\u2019s been able to define himself on his own terms\u2026 When first elected, Tillis was widely regarded as a political moderate, more interested in pragmatism than political ideology. As speaker, however, he has presided over sweeping changes in state policies from abortion and gun rights to taxes and voting. As a candidate he\u2019s left little room between himself and his rivals on issues, and often taken positions at odds with his establishment supporters.\u201d KENTUCKY RAIN: OUTSIDE CASH POURS INTO RACEUSA Today: \u201cKentuckians for Strong Leadership, a super PAC aiding Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election, raised nearly $1.2 million during the last half of 2013.

That figure includes 558 who spent more than 1,500 hours annually on official time, which means they did little, if any, work for their agencies, and 150 who spent at least 1,000 hours annually on union release.

            "article_content": "A new theory says the model for Lady Liberty was a veiled Muslim peasant. Those wagging their fingers at critics of President Obama\u2019s plan to bring thousands of Middle East refugees to the America have an irresistible new talking point: Lady Liberty was Muslim. The statue\u2019s legendary designer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Auguste Bartholdi, repurposed a lighthouse design rejected by Egypt, according to the theory, and used the same robe-clad woman \u2013 minus a veil \u2013 as his model for sculptor Gustave Eiffel\u2019s 151-foot statue that has stood in New York Harbor since 1886. If true, that would make the fact that mostly Muslim immigrants from Syria are not getting the red carpet treatment \u2013 amid fears of terrorism - deeply ironic, say supporters of the refugees. \u201c \u2026 there she now stands, the Muslim woman turned to Lady Liberty, the light in her upraised hand symbolizing so much more than simple progress, the inscription at the base words from the poet Emma Lazarus that are familiar to us all,\u201d wrote The Daily Beast\u2019s Michael Daly, helpfully pointing out that only \u201cpossibly one\u201d of the terrorists who killed 130 and injured hundreds more in the Oct. 13 attacks in Paris was a Syrian refugee. \u201cThey\u2019re both female figures but they\u2019re not the same figure.\u201d As lyrical as the claim about the inspiration behind Lady Liberty may be for some, it is historically dubious, according to experts. The torch and tablet-bearing statue has always been believed to represent the Roman goddess Libertas, welcoming immigrants to American shores. Although Daly and others claim that Bartholdi's mental model for the design was the same Egyptian peasant that served as his muse for a proposed Suez Canal lighthouse, two experts have their doubts. \u201cThat\u2019s a serious oversimplification,\u201d Edward Berenson, professor of history at New York University and author of \u201cStatue of Liberty: A Translatlantic Story,\u201d told Canada\u2019s Global News. Berenson does admit that it is possible Bartholdi used his sketches from the Egyptian project, which was to stand 86 feet high above a 48-foot pedestal and be called \u201cEgypt Carrying the Light to Asia.\u201d But if he did, it was likely just as a starting point, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a relationship between the Egyptian statue that Bartholdi first conceived in the late 1860s,\u201d Berenson said. \u201cBut that statue changed as it migrated to the United States. The original version of the statue made sense for Egyptian society. It wouldn\u2019t have made sense for America.\u201d Barry Moreno, the historian at the Statue of Liberty National Monument, told Global News Bartholdi\u2019s Egyptian project \u201chad nothing to do with the Statue of Liberty.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re both female figures but they\u2019re not the same figure,\u201d he said. Previously, African-American academics have claimed the statue\u2019s model was a \u00a0was inspired by a black woman. In a book entitled \"The Journey of The Songhai People,\" the late University of Florida professor James Haskins, who was a member of the National Education Advisory Committee of the Liberty-Ellis Island Committee, wrote that the statue was inspired by the role black soldiers played in the Civil War. President Obama has proposed taking in thousands of mainly Muslim refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern nations. Critics in Congress say it would be impossible to screen them to keep members of ISIS out, and note that ISIS has said it planned to infiltrate the waves of refugees now flooding Europe. The FBI director and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have acknowledged that it may not be possible to ensure no terrorists arrive with the refugees.",

But neither she nor her hosts seemed the slightest bit embarrassed. They should have been. Having a Democratic frontrunner who is currently embroiled in a scandal involving her unprecedented efforts to conceal her activities as a cabinet official handing out the hardware and taking no questions should have been impossibly awkward. Instead, it provides a good indication of the level of scrutiny to which Clinton can expect to be subject in her campaign. She joked (or was it taunted?), \u201c\u2018I am all about new beginnings: a new grandchild, another new hairstyle, a new email account.\u201d Haw, haw. There are nearly unending questions, many of them fresh, about Clinton\u2019s private server and her destruction of tens of thousands of emails from her time as secretary of state. Clinton is taking the final steps before the public launch of her second presidential campaign in the midst of stonewalling the press, but no one seemed to mind. [AP: \u201c[President Obama] and [Hillary Clinton] met privately at the White House Monday afternoon\u2026Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton posted a message on Twitter praising Obama's health care law\u2026\u201d]Beat-sweeteners unite \u2013 Clinton talked about problems with her \u201crelationship\u201d with the news media, as if it were simply a misunderstanding or a matter of overcoming past mistrust. In the establishment media narrative, the question is whether the presumptive nominee will just \u201clet her guard down\u201d and let the people and the press see the \u201creal her.\u201d That\u2019s just a bidding war among beat-sweetening reporters who are auditioning for access, implicitly promising to offer the perfect depiction of a strong-yet-nurturing-yet-funny-yet-thoughtful-yet-open-minded-yet-experienced candidate. It has nothing to do with the questions Clinton prefers to leave unanswered about her electronic antics or her buckraking from questionable sources around the globe. Nor does it address what she plans to do about the growing pressure for her to hand over her servers to a third party for review.Flattened out - Though Charlie Cook argues today that Clinton will continue to take blows from the press, Monday\u2019s spectacle was probably a much better indication of the kind of kid-glove treatment Clinton will mostly receive. Clinton can count on the fact that mainstream coverage of her bid will be more like that given to a new product launch from an old institution than that which should be given to an actual candidate seeking the presidency. The danger for Clinton, though, is that the media mandarins who murmured and applauded their way through her remarks are increasingly being replaced by hungrier, younger reporters at new outlets. Clinton was not able to deal with the disruptions wrought by social media in her first presidential run. The world has changed dramatically in the past eight years, and she may not be ready to meet the challenge.Hillary never had an inspector general at State - Bloomberg: \u201cOne of the many unanswered questions of the Hillary Clinton e-mail story has been: Whose job was it to raise and address concerns about her exclusive use of a private account? According to open government advocates, it would have been the agency\u2019s permanent, independent Inspector General\u2014someone nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate\u2014if such a person had existed.\u00a0For five years, including all of Clinton\u2019s time as secretary, the State Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General never had a confirmed inspector.\u2026By September 2013, several months after Clinton left State, the department finally had a permanent inspector, and the department recently released a report documenting how few e-mails the State Department has saved for government records.\u201dImmigration activists back Warren\u2019s symbolic non-candidacy - Buzzfeed: \u201cSome of the activists who made immigration a difficult issue for President Obama in 2014 are now signing onto the effort to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren, or some other Democrat, to challenge Hillary Clinton. \u2026The latest participants: Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente Action, which counts 300,000 members nationwide, and Erika Andiola, a national DREAMer activist, who played a key role in the fight for Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\u201dO\u2019Malley revs up core backers - WaPo: \u201cMartin O\u2019Malley\u2019s leading supporters left an afternoon gathering in Baltimore on Monday more convinced than ever that he will move forward with a 2016 presidential bid, several participants in the event said. The former Maryland governor, who\u2019s said he will probably make a decision by May, huddled with more than 150 donors and other boosters at the Baltimore Hilton for what was billed as an \u2018issues conference.\u2019\u201dOBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF DENOUNCES ISRAEL\u2019S \u201850-YEAR OCCUPATION\u2019 OF PALESTINENPR: \u201cThrough his chief of staff, President Obama is strongly countering rhetoric from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a two-state, Israeli-Palestinian solution. \u2019An occupation that has lasted for almost 50 years must end, and the Palestinian people must have the right to live in and govern themselves in their own sovereign state,\u2019 Denis McDonough, President Obama's chief of staff, said Monday at the annual conference of J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel group.\u201dBipartisan worries: 84 percent of House members sign letter warning Obama on Iran - The Hill: \u201cA letter to President Obama signed by 367 members of Congress warns that lawmakers must be satisfied that any Iranian nuclear agreement must \u2018foreclose any pathway to a bomb\u2019 before they lift sanctions against Tehran. The letter, which was drafted in early March but released on Monday, warns Obama that \u2018permanent sanctions relief from congressionally-mandated sanctions would require new legislation\u2019 from Congress. \u2018Congress must be convinced that its terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb, and only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions relief,\u2019 reads the letter, led by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and ranking member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.).\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...The New Criterion offers the remarkable story of the Kamuzu Academy in heart of Malawi, where the country\u2019s former dictator Hastings Kamuzu Banda ordained that a preparatory school built on the Eton model would teach the classics of Greek and Latin literature. Banda is gone, as is the lavish funding that once made the school an opulent oasis. But the school remains, thanks to international funds and the patronage of local strongmen. British-educated Alexander Suebsaeng came to teach and discovered a bizarre world within a world, where American hip-hop clashes with Homer and Western weakness is overawed by Chinese electronics. It is a truly remarkable read. \u201cParadoxically, this evokes a powerful sense of changelessness: against what is constant, even and especially constant change, all human activity appears feeble, all ambition futile. ...

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, looked to transform his following among Tea Party conservatives into a broad mandate: \u201c[I]n what aides signaled was a deliberate move by the principled yet tactical politician, Cruz used his address to emphasize the universality of his American experience, one that cuts across political, gender and class lines. The senator discussed his emotionally trying upbringing as the son of a Cuban refugee father and pioneering computer programmer mother \u2014 emphasizing how his Delaware-native mother advanced at work during a period when women were discouraged from pursuing careers.\u201d Paul hits Cruz on \u2018winability\u2019 - \u201cRight now, I\u2019m the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states. There will be a lot of conservatives. Ted Cruz is a conservative, but it also goes to winability. And people will have to make a decision: Which is the Republican that can not only excite the base but can also bring new people into the party without giving up principles?\" \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d\u00a0 Watch here.Right face - WaPo takes a detailed look at how, with Cruz in, the race for the GOP right is heating up: \u201c[A]t least a half-dozen credible contenders are likely to join Cruz in competing for the hearts of conservatives. They face a labyrinth of tests of ideology and temperament, on talk radio and at tea party and faith forums, in a melee to become the hard right\u2019s standard-bearer.\u201dHillary\u2019s camp: Cruz is good news - \u201cThose closest to the former secretary of state have counseled patience, arguing that a core element of Clinton\u2019s plan was to get out of the way and let the dueling wings of the Republican Party savage each other while she floats above it all, Politico reports. Cruz, they say, is Hillary\u2019s wrecking ball.\u201dCruz tipped Rubio - Politico: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz surprised many political observers by becoming the first official presidential candidate for 2016 on Monday. But not Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio (R-Fla.) said he got a heads-up from his conservative colleague last week that the announcement was forthcoming, and Rubio praised Cruz (R-Texas) several times during a lengthy gaggle with Capitol Hill reporters on Monday afternoon.\u201dTrump trolls Cruz on nativity - \u201cTed has just one extra level of complication\u2026 He was a Canadian and American citizen a couple of years ago.

The invitation asks for donations or for attendees to raise up to $100,000 per couple. The reception on behalf of the Right to Rise Super PAC will be held at the home of bank executive Gerald Ford and his wife Kelli\u2026The invitation, with the list of about 50 Texas supporters, indicates the millionaire-business class that have been big backers of establishment Republicans in Texas. Among those joining the event are real estate developer Woody Hunt, oil man T. Boone Pickens, attorney Mike Boone, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans, former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, former ambassador to Switzerland Pam Willeford, homebuilder David Weekley, former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler and beer distributor John Nau. Some of the list, such as Nau and Weekley, also had been big donors to Perry as governor. Listed on the invitation is special guests Jeb Bush \u2018along with President and Mrs. George W. Bush.\u2019\u201d BIG WIN FOR WALKER AT SUPREME COURTWaPo: \u201cThe Supreme Court on Monday turned down a challenge to Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law, which it had previously kept from going into effect before November's elections. The court's decision not to review a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the law was a victory for Gov. Scott Walker (R) and perhaps other states that have tightened voting procedures to require additional identification. More challenges to specific state laws are in the pipeline.\u201dCOMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE, 2.0: KASICH HITS THE TRAILCincinnati Enquirer: \u201cOhio Gov. John Kasich is testing his potential presidential message in earnest this week, starting with a campaign trip in New Hampshire [today]. Will the trip springboard Kasich to the top of a crowded, but far from closed, GOP presidential field? Or will his presidential campaign fizzle before it kicks off?

Thursday he travels to Maine, for another balanced-budget amendment pitch.\u201d [Kasich\u2019s stops will include the Politics & Eggs breakfast, followed by a question and answer session with the Nashua Chamber of Commerce and finally a stop at Politics & Pie.]Social justice candidate - Yahoo\u2019s Andrew Romano takes an in-depth look at Kasich\u2019s effort to meld the social-justice doctrine of his faith with Republicanism: \u201cKasich is convinced that he\u2019s a different kind of Republican. \u2018For some reason, the Lord has made me more aware of people\u2019s problems,\u2019 Kasich told me in West Virginia. \u2018And I take that awareness seriously.\u2019 His mission now is to convince everybody else.\u201dEchoes of another race, another Bush - With Kasich little known in New Hampshire, AP notes how 2016 bears similarities to his 2000 effort against another Bush: \u201cKasich briefly sought the 2000 presidential nomination when then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush emerged as a force in Republican politics. Kasich remembers the challenge well. \u2018First of all I was a congressman, nobody knew who I was,\u2019 he said. \u2018Secondly, I didn't have a big financial base.\u2019 Third, \u2018I knew the handwriting was on the wall\u2019 pointing to Bush winning.\u201d [Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron is back on the trail bringing the latest from Kasich in the Granite State.]CAMPAIGN DAYBOOK* Former Sen.

He\u2019s bright, articulate, and has a personal immigration story that gives him personal experience and gravitas from which to speak. He could be a very attractive Republican uniter, if he can hold his own in the shake-out process.\u201d \u2013 John E Sutton\u201cWhile I like Ted Cruz, I believe he\u2019s too far to the right to attract the Independent voting block come the general election. My take is a Scott Walker/Carly Fiorina ticket would be the perfect GOP foil to Hillary\u2019s campaign. Carly could assail Hillary\u2019s record without the claims of sexism, and you know that\u2019s coming, and Walker has proven you can take on the union and still win three elections.\u201d \u2013 Dave LutterNEIGHBORS RELIEVED BY BURGLARYReuters: \u201cBritish police said on Monday they were hunting for thieves who broke into an apartment in northwest England and stole 38 Royal Python snakes.

Putin waved away the urgent rhetoric from Washington about a Russian invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, saying that he had already ordered troops near the region back to their bases. The masked, armed men who look so much like Russian special forces patrolling the streets in Crimea, Putin explained, are just local fighters who have taken to the streets to defend the Russian majority population. But the real troops might show up again, Putin said. Why? Because he wants to protect democracy. From Reuters: \u201c\u2018There can be only one assessment of what happened in Kiev, in Ukraine in general. This was an anti-constitutional coup and the armed seizure of power,\u2019\u00a0 said Putin, looking relaxed as he sat before a small group of reporters at his residence near Moscow. \u2018As for bringing in forces. For now there is no such need but such a possibility exists,\u2019 he said. \u2018What could serve as a reason to use military force? It would naturally be the last resort, absolutely the last.\u2019\u201d Time is on his side - This doesn\u2019t sound like a guy who is smarting from President Obama\u2019s ruling Monday that Russia was \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d Obama, talking to reporters with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, whittled down some of his tougher talk from Friday, saying that \u201cover time\u201d Russia\u2019s incursion would be a \u201ccostly proposition.\u201d The message Putin seems to have taken is that he has time to shore up Russian control of the region before the eventual resolution. Given the international community\u2019s unwillingness to make stark determinations about such things as invasions, especially when they involve a permanent UN Security Council member that is the primary energy supplier to Western Europe, Time does seem to be on Putin\u2019s side, whatever history eventually adjudges.

OBAMACARE VICTIM RETURNS FIRE IN NEW ADNYT: \u201cAmericans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group being challenged by Democrats over the content of its ads attacking the health care law, is pushing back with a new commercial that will begin airing Tuesday in Michigan. The commercial features Julie Boonstra, a Michigan woman who was the subject of an earlier ad, in which she said she had lost the health plan that she preferred for treatment of her leukemia and was facing higher costs because of the health care law. Lawyers for Representative Gary Peters, a Democrat who is seeking Michigan\u2019s open Senate seat, wrote to television stations asking them to demand verification for the claims in the initial commercial\u2026 In the new ad, Ms. Boonstra says the attacks on her credibility have been devastating and accuses Mr. Peters of trying to silence her. \u2018All I want is to be listened to,\u2019 she says in the commercial. \u2018There are thousands of people out there who are hurting because of Obamacare.\u2019\u201d [Watch the new ad here] VULNERABLE DEMS, INSURERS WANT FAST ACTION ON OBAMACARE DELAYThe Hill says a formal announcement of a long-promised change to ObamaCare rules could come as soon as this week as Democrats brace for more backlash from cancelled policies.

This plan, like the Republican alternatives starting to dribble out, is about trying to win those elections. For the president, that means incentivizing his base to get out and vote.

Although the White House did not specify the budgetary cost of its proposed programs, it said in a release that the tax breaks would be offset in the budget by raising taxes on certain high-income earners. \u2026 The main feature of the White House\u2019s plan would be to make permanent the expansion of the EITC to families with three or more children from the 2009 stimulus, and to increase the tax break even further by expanding it for childless workers\u2026 The EITC is intended to aid poor people while also encouraging work.

            "article_content": "Pressure building on powerful Democrats to close the case WASHINGTON \u2013 Just five months before the presidential election, the State Department is under fire in courtrooms over its delays in turning over government files related to Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. In one case, the agency warned it needed a 27-month delay, until October 2018, to turn over emails from Clinton's former aides, and the judge in another case, a lawsuit by The Associated Press, wondered aloud whether the State Department might be deliberately delaying until after the election. \"We're now reaching a point where there's mounting frustration that this is a project where the State Department may be running out the clock,\" said U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon. The judge said he was considering imposing penalties on the agency if it failed to meet the next set of deadlines he orders. Leon wondered aloud at one point whether he might impose penalties for again failing to deliver records on time. He mused about \"a fine on a daily basis\" or \"incarceration.\" \"I can't send the marshals, obviously, out to bring in the documents, at least they wouldn't know where to go, probably,\" Leon said. Secretary of State John Kerry and other officials have said they are committed to public transparency, vowing that the State Department will improve its practices under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Last year, after an inspector general's audit harshly critical of the agency, Kerry appointed a \"transparency coordinator,\" Janice Jacobs, and said the agency would \"fundamentally improve our ability to respond to requests for our records.\" But in three separate court hearings last week, officials acknowledged that their records searches were hobbled by errors and new delays and said they need far more time to produce Clinton records. In other cases where the agency has already reached legal agreements with news organizations and political groups, the final delivery of thousands of records will not come until months after the November election \u2014 far too late to give voters an opportunity to analyze the performance of Clinton and her aides. State Department spokesman John Kirby blamed the spiraling delays on mounting requests for more files. \"These requests are also frequently more complex, and increasingly seeking larger volumes of documents requiring more time, more resources and frankly, more interagency coordination,\" Kirby said. The State Department said in court that it had miscalculated the amount of material it expected to process as part of a public records lawsuit from Citizens United, a conservative interest group. In basic searches of 14,000 pages of records, officials failed to include the \"to\" and \"from\" lines of the messages, missing many possible records. \"These delay tactics by the Obama administration look like nothing more than an assist to former Secretary Clinton,\" said the group's president, David Bossie. The AP had better luck asking for files about the role Clinton or her aides played in a 2011 decision allowing the British defense contractor BAE Systems plc to avoid being barred from government work and instead pay a $79 million fine. The AP received some records, but last week, the judge said he will likely order the State Department to turn over remaining files in September instead of mid-October, as the agency proposed. Government lawyers said they need to review thousands of pages and allow the files to be examined by BAE's lawyers in case the company identifies proprietary material that would need to be censored. \"I'm not going to set them for October, two weeks before the election, that's ridiculous,\" Leon said. In a third court case, the Gawker.com news site was told by State Department lawyers last week that the agency had failed to provide at least 100 email attachments from Philippe Reines, a Clinton aide who used a private account to send work-related messages. Gawker and the agency agreed that the State Department would turn over the missing material by September. Also last week, during another legal proceeding involving Huma Abedin, Clinton's closest aide and her former deputy chief of staff, Abedin said she \"was never asked to search my emails for anything related to FOIA when I was at State.\" Logs of requests showed that Abedin's emails had been sought at the time by reporters for Gawker, Huffington Post and other organizations. Kirby told the AP that he could not comment on whether Abedin's files were properly searched during Clinton's tenure. But he added that \"we have acknowledged that historically we did not have a consistent practice for searching emails in the Office of the Secretary.\"",

Husted told Fox last week that his office would investigate any allegation of fraud or tampering that is brought to his attention by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who warns of election \u201crigging\u201d regularly, or anyone else. James is appearing with Clinton at a rally in Cleveland. Fox News first spotted the unidentified male Sunday making contact with dozens of people in the voting line, handing out small pieces of paper with instructions about how to RSVP for the event at the nearby Cleveland Public Auditorium, several hours later. The bottom of the flyer stated: \u201cPrinted in House, Paid for by the Ohio Democratic Party.\u201d Multiple signs posted outside the polling place state: \u201cATTENTION: No person shall loiter, congregate or engage in any kind of election campaigning within 10 FEET of any elector in line to vote. Ohio Revised Code Section 3501.35.\u201d A review of the code shows that violating this law can result in either being sued or put in jail for 30 days, depending on the severity of the offense. The man handing out the invitations within the 10-foot boundary declined to give his name or say whether he was working for the Clinton campaign. \u201cYou\u2019re not cute enough to get my name,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary and LeBron after you\u2019re done voting.\u201d Secretary Husted\u2019s office contacted the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections about the incident. The office spokesman said he was \u201cassured\u201d that officials are \"walking up and down the line to preserve the 10-foot barrier that voters are guaranteed by Ohio law.\u201d However, a board spokesperson declined to review the video or following up to see whether the incident was in violation on any laws. \u201cWe are doing the best we can to enforce the law,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhen our staff sees people getting too close to the line, we try to correct their behavior.\u201d The Ohio Democratic Party has yet to respond to several requests for comment.",

Both polls attempted to measure the national popular vote, but wound up capturing the scale of Donald Trump's victory in the Electoral College. \"As far as I was concerned, I was anticipating a Trump win,\" said\u00a0Raghavan Mayur, President of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts the IBD/TIPP poll. The final poll, released on Election Day, showed Trump with a two-percentage point lead over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Mayur compared Tuesday's election to 2004, when enthusiasm among Republicans helped George W. Bush get re-elected president despite exit polls favoring then-Sen. John Kerry. He also saw \"very robust enthusiasm\" for Trump among independents, which canceled out the registration advantage held by Democrats. \"Since Sept. 1, the number of Republicans [in the poll sample] was much higher than the number of Democrats,\" Mayur said. \"It was a new phenomenon in the data [and] I was not sure what is happening here.\" \"Day after day, I was weighing down Republicans until the final four or five days [of the race],\" Mayur continued. \"What I am seeing is ... a good amount of enthusiasm ... so I was going to predict who would show up.\" \"Polling is as much an art as science,\" said IBD Commentary Editor Terry Jones. \"It requires judgement ... [Mayur] sort of sensed this move and our polling responded to great enthusiasm. \"If you turn [voters] out, you'll get them enthused, and last night we saw that.\" The USC/LA Times tracking poll, notable for interviewing the same 3,200 respondents over a period of several months, gave Trump a 3.2-percentage point lead the day before the election. Since it premiered in early July, the poll results were about six percentage points more favorable to the real estate mogul than the national average. \"To be honest, I was surprised,\" University of Southern California economist Arie Kapteyn, who developed the poll, told the Los Angeles Times. \"I thought Clinton would win. But that shouldn\u2019t change the numbers.\" The poll surveyed voters on their likelihood, on a scale of 0-100, of supporting a certain candidate, as well as their likelihood of actually going to the polls. That helped Kapteyn and colleague Jill Darling detect white voters who sat out the 2012 election, but broke for Trump on Election Day. The pollsters' decision to weigh the sample based on voters' self-reported 2012 choices raised eyebrows and skewed the results toward Trump, according to former U.S. Treasury economist Ernie Tedeschi. The problem, according to Tedeschi, is that many people will incorrectly claim to have voted for Obama in 2012, when they actually voted for Romney or another candidate. On Election Day, Tedeschi ran his own version of the poll that gave more weight to census factors, such as marital status. The result showed Clinton leading the popular vote by just under 2 points, closer to the likely final outcome of the election. REVISED: Census-reweighted LAT/USC, Nov 8: Clinton +1.9https://t.co/NgjGMaBkfU pic.twitter.com/wXLxK3XZU4 \"It was an exercise to try to figure out what made the poll an outlier,\" Tedeschi said. \"I actually like the poll [method] a lot. \"If they had looked around and thought 'Boy, we're really out of line' and changed it,\" he added. \"That is in and of itself a form of bias.\"",

            "article_content": "Final national poll before voters cast their ballots revealed on 'America's Newsroom' With one day before Election Day, Hillary Clinton has a four percentage-point lead over Donald Trump, according to the final Fox News national pre-election poll of likely voters. She\u2019s ahead by 48-44 percent, while Gary Johnson receives 3 percent and Jill Stein 2 percent. In the two-way race, it\u2019s also Clinton over Trump by 48-44 percent. Click here to read the poll results. Clinton\u2019s advantage is within the poll\u2019s margin of error in both the two-way and four-way races. The last Fox News Poll, released Friday, had Clinton ahead by two points in the four-way race and one point in the head-to-head matchup. Clinton is now winning among women by 12 points (52-40 percent), blacks by 85 (89-4 percent), Hispanics by 33 (63-30 percent), and voters under 30 by 16 (51-35 percent). That level of support is close to that of Barack Obama\u2019s winning coalition against Mitt Romney in 2012, when he won among women by 11 points (55-44 percent), blacks by 87 (93-6 percent), Hispanics by 44 (71-27 percent), and young voters by 23 (60-37 percent). Trump is favored among men by 5 points (48-43 percent), whites by 17 (54-37 percent), white evangelical Christians by 63 (78-15 percent), and whites without a college degree by 31 (61-30 percent). That nearly matches Romney\u2019s performance.\u00a0 He won men by 7 points (52-45 percent), whites by 20 (59-39 percent), white evangelicals by 57 (78-21 percent), and whites without a degree by 26 (62-36 percent). Trump is ahead of Clinton among veterans by 56-38 percent.\u00a0 She leads with first-time voters, by 48-42 percent. Nine percent of Republicans support Clinton.\u00a0 That\u2019s more than twice the number of Democrats backing Trump (four percent). And while Clinton garners more support among Democrats (91 percent) than Trump does among Republicans (86 percent), she trails among independents.\u00a0 They go for Trump by 42-36 percent, and 14 percent back Johnson or Stein.\u00a0 Independents went for Romney by 50-45 percent. \u201cRepublican partisans have mostly come home, but it looks to be too little, too late for Trump,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cUnless his voters are really shy, it seems his upwards trend has stalled just short of the goal line.\u201d Clinton\u2019s backers (61 percent) remain less likely than Trump\u2019s (68 percent) to \u201cstrongly\u201d support their candidate. Trump continues to best Clinton narrowly on being seen as honest and trustworthy (+4 points).\u00a0 At the same time, she significantly outperforms him on having the right temperament to serve as president (+23) and being qualified for the job (+18) -- plus, she has an advantage on personal favorability (+4). \u201cThe over 1-in-10 voters who don\u2019t like either candidate tend to think Clinton has the temperament and qualifications to be president, but Trump doesn\u2019t,\u201d says Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cAnd that looks to be the difference in the election.\u201d The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,410 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from November 3-6, 2016.\u00a0 The survey includes results among 1,295 likely voters.\u00a0 The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among both registered voters and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton makes history, becomes first woman to be the presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton took a historic step closer Tuesday to fulfilling her dream of shattering what she once called \u201cthat highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d\u00a0when Democratic delegates at the party's national convention in Philadelphia officially nominated her as their candidate for president \u2013 making the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state the first woman to top a major party presidential ticket. South Dakota\u2019s delegation put her over the top in the tally, but it was ex-primary foe Bernie Sanders who closed out the roll call and made her nomination official after his home state of Vermont cast its votes. \u201cI move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States,\u201d Sanders said, as the crowd erupted in cheers and waved Clinton signs. The nomination was affirmed by acclamation\u00a0moments later; the final delegate tally was 2,842-1,865. The high-profile show of unity on the floor, at a convention marked from the start by discord, followed speculation about what role Sanders might play in formally anointing Clinton the nominee. The night before, the Vermont senator tried to restore order in the hall by urging his supporters \u2013 many of whom booed Monday night at the mere mention of Clinton\u2019s name \u2013 to get behind her campaign. Those supporters loudly cheered and chanted his name as Sanders was put in for nomination Tuesday afternoon. Some antics popped up during the roll call itself. While the Nevada delegation was casting its votes, Sanders supporters held signs behind the speaker's head saying \u201cRigged\u201d and \u201cI was leaked.\u201d Large pro-Sanders banners practically covered the Oklahoma delegation speakers from the view of some media cameras. Some Sanders supporters also walked out at the end, chanting, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d as a couple-hundred protesters chanted \u201cshame\u201d outside the complex. But the rancor in the hall may be subsiding in the wake of the opening day\u2019s street protests and disruptions inside the convention arena. Longtime Clinton ally and civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., touted her qualifications as he delivered one of the nominating speeches on her behalf. \u201cShe is one of the most qualified candidates to ever run for president,\u201d he bellowed. In a moment of poetic justice, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard delivered one of the nominating speeches for Sanders moments earlier, describing his cause as a \u201cmovement fueled by love\u201d that \u201ccan never be stopped or defeated.\u201d Gabbard had resigned in protest from the DNC amid complaints over how Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had treated Sanders; Wasserman Schultz over the weekend was forced to resign following leaked emails that bolstered those claims of anti-Sanders bias. The roll call preceded another stacked night of speeches, headlined by former President Bill Clinton, the latest party elder to attempt to get the base to close ranks behind his wife and direct its energy toward defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November. Sanders made a similar case the night before. \u201cBased on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States,\u201d he told the audience Monday, with many of his supporters visibly crying during his remarks. The frustration among his base had been inflamed in the run-up to the convention, when the leaked Democratic National Committee emails appeared to show top party officials criticizing him and discussing ways to undermine him. While Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign in the wake of the leak, that alone did not quell the unrest. The party is eager to bring all factions together, though, in preparation for the general election battle officially joined Tuesday against Trump, who was formally nominated by the Republicans last week in Cleveland. On the sidelines, Trump was hammering Democrats Tuesday for all but omitting reference to the Islamic State terror network on their opening night. \u201cDems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here,\u201d he tweeted Tuesday.",
