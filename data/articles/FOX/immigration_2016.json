            "article_content": "In this Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012, photo a new home is constructed in Pepper Pike, Ohio. US home construction surges 12.1 percent in December to end best year since 2008. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak) (AP Photo/Tony Dejak) The 2016 election has been defined so far by immigration, Islamic terror, and economic inequality and the outsider candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders that brought them to the fore. But poor access to housing in America, and the lingering aftereffects of the 2008 housing crash, remains a chief motivator of anger and dissatisfaction amongst an electorate that views the economy and the mortgage market as rigged against ordinary people. My firm recently conducted a comprehensive national study that assessed housing and mortgage access generally, as well as perceptions and policy preferences about government-sponsored mortgage entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac specifically. We found widespread dissatisfaction with access to housing and mortgages in America and a clear perception that a rigged housing system works against ordinary people who can\u2019t borrow money and suffered during the housing crisis. Voters believe that the housing status quo is not working, especially for minorities. They blame banks and the federal government for not supporting policies that advance the interests of homeownership, more affordable housing, more lending. A majority (53%) of American voters believe that \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for people like me to buy a home,\u201d and fully four-in-ten (41%) likely voters agree that \u201cBanks don\u2019t want to provide mortgages to people like me.\u201d In short: Americans believe the housing game is rigged. Even more worrisome is that the sentiment \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for people like me to buy a home\u201d is highest among Hispanic (78%) and black voters (67%), and people of color overall agree with this statement 27 points more than whites. This pervasive dissatisfaction and inequality means something is very wrong in our housing market. It follows that we must ask how voters should approach these deep-seated problems and what policy solutions do they want? The answer, it turns out, is straightforward: empower Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to improve housing access and protect investors who are expanding mortgage access at a time when people struggle to borrow. When asked about the Net Worth Sweep of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal policy that diverts 100% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s profits to the government\u2019s revenue stream, a plurality (47%) of likely voters believe the sweep takes funds that could be used to increase the availability of mortgages, is a violation of shareholder rights. Black voters are most likely to consider the Net Worth Sweep part of a rigged system, with a majority (52%) believing that the sweep is unfair. Further, nearly two-thirds (63%) of likely voters believe the rights of shareholders and investors in mortgage-granting organizations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be protected from the government. Support for shareholder rights is consistently strong across both white voters (64%) and People of Color (62%). Seventy one percent of black voters support shareholder rights over government interests, the highest of any group. Americans demand swift action on housing because the crisis has been devastating to voters who desperately want Congress and the federal government to take steps to ensure housing fairness and help more Americans own homes. Nearly a quarter (23%) of likely voters or their families have lost their home since the 2008 housing crisis, and 43% know someone who has lost their home since the 2008 housing crisis. The desire for policy change is widespread and urgent, with large majorities of voters supporting a new federal approach to housing policy that makes more money available for mortgages and mortgages themselves easier to get. It is clear that housing policy reform, and the desire to empower federal entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help more Americans own homes, is one of the great untold stories and underappreciated drivers of the 2016 election.",

That\u2019s according to a new Fox News national poll on top issues in the 2016 election. Relatively few voters, 26 percent, feel they\u2019re better off now compared to before President Barack Obama took office. So it should be no surprise about four voters in 10 -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- say the economy will be the issue that decides their vote for president (39 percent). No other issue comes close.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the others rank:\u00a0 14 percent say national security will be most important in their vote, 10 percent each for education and health care, and 8 percent each for immigration and social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Voters trust Trump to do a better job on the top two.\u00a0 He bests Clinton by 12 points on both the economy (53-41 percent) and terrorism (52-40 percent). The poll, released Thursday, was conducted prior to news of an EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo crashing in the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Clinton has the edge on social issues (+12 points), education (+10), foreign policy (+10), health care (+3), and immigration (+2). Trump is the candidate voters believe will do a better job \u201ctelling the truth to the American people\u201d (+15 points), managing tax dollars (+14 points), and restoring trust in government (+8 points). Trust of the candidates is about equal when it comes to using military force (Trump +1), nominating Supreme Court justices (Clinton +1), and \u201cencouraging values you believe in\u201d (Clinton +2). Immigration is a signature issue for Trump, but more voters not only trust Clinton to handle it, but she is also picked by a 35-point margin on \u201crepresenting the views of Latinos.\u201d Nearly one in five (17 percent) says agreeing on immigration issues is a deal-breaker for them when deciding their vote for president.\u00a0 That increases to 29 percent among Hispanic/Latino voters. But who would voters trust with the nuclear codes?\u00a0 That\u2019s Clinton, by 11 points (49-38 percent). Pollpourri From the beginning of his campaign, Trump has said he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0 People believe him.\u00a0 By a 54-42 percent margin, voters think Trump \u201ctruly will\u201d build the wall.\u00a0 By 50-44 percent, they believe he will forcibly deport illegal immigrants. Those who plan to vote for Trump (66 percent) are more likely than Clinton supporters (46 percent) to think he\u2019ll build the wall.\u00a0 At the same time, Trump voters (43 percent) are less likely than those backing Clinton (60 percent) to think he\u2019ll forcibly deport illegal immigrants. Overall, voters are more likely than not to believe Trump will nominate a conservative to the Supreme Court (65-22 percent) and ban non-U.S. Muslims (58-37 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,021 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from May 14-17, 2016.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Alicia Acuna reports Will Donald Trump's immigration message make him vulnerable in the traditionally red state of Arizona? Hillary Clinton's campaign has been fighting for the western prize despite a Trump lead in the polls. The America's Election Headquarters 2016 Scorecard rates Arizona as leaning Republican and eleven Electoral votes at stake. \u00a0The Real Clear Politics average in Arizona shows Trump 46% and Clinton 42%. Clinton has a strong ground game advantage that started early, including more than 30 offices in the state. The campaign has sent big hitter surrogates like First Lady Michelle Obama, Chelsea Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders to the Grand Canyon state, in addition to running mate Senator Tim Kaine. Yet, only one Democrat, Bill Clinton, has carried the state since Harry Truman did in 1948. Throughout the race, Trump has made immigration a cornerstone, hot button issue. Border state Arizona has the fifth-highest number of eligible Hispanic voters in all of the states and it's estimated the Latino vote could top 20 percent for the first time. Chuck Coughlin, political analyst and president of HighGround Public Affairs Consultants in Phoenix, says, \"The very simplistic rhetoric that you hear from the Trump campaign about build the wall, ship 'em home, it just doesn't resonate with Arizona voters by and large. It resonates with about 30 percent of the Republican base.\" Republicans have an advantage in voter registration but had been under-performing by 2 to 3 percent, according to a recent post by HighGround. The GOP appears to be making up for it after a week of solid returns and turnout effort. HighGround also says turnout among independents and unaffiliated voters has been slightly lower, adding, \"There are a few explanations that might fit: \u00a0perhaps it is because they tend to vote later or maybe it is that no one has a concentrated turnout drive just focused on independents.\" If the election results are mixed on the East Coast and all eyes turn to this Western battleground, how secure is the vote? \u00a0This past summer the state was a target of what's believed to be a foreign entity that tried unsuccessfully to hack the state's voter database. Secretary of State of the State of Arizona Michele Reagan told Fox News, \"It'd be very, very hard to rig the vote itself and we'd be able to back it up with those paper audit trails.\" \u00a0For example, voting machines and results do not transmit over the internet. The secretary, who just recently met with federal counterterrorism officials said, \"False information and fake information, is just as dangerous as hacking election systems and so we're really on guard for that and we're really watching our systems as well. \u00a0That's probably my biggest fear, much bigger than the vote itself being hacked.\"",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump renewed warnings about Middle Eastern refugees and other immigrants coming to America on the heels of Sunday\u2019s terror massacre in Orlando, while claiming thousands already are in the country who \u2013 like the shooter \u2013 are \u201csick with hate.\u201d Though the gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen, Trump told Fox News on Monday that the U.S. is allowing others into the country who are \u201cno different than this maniac.\u201d \u201cThis could be the all-time great Trojan horse,\u201d Trump said, of those being admitted from Syria and other nations. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has only amplified his warnings about immigration and the terror threat since Sunday\u2019s massacre left 49 dead and even more wounded. At the same time, he\u2019s aggressively criticized both President Obama and likely general election rival Hillary Clinton for not initially using the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d in describing the shooter\u2019s religious background. \u201cShe won\u2019t even utter the words,\u201d Trump said Monday. On Sunday, Trump had said Obama should \u201cstep down\u201d for not using the term and Clinton should \u201cget out of this race\u201d if she won\u2019t either. In remarks that were getting widespread attention Monday, Trump also made a vague statement about Obama interpreted by some as a reference to his sympathies. \u201cHe doesn't get it or, or he gets it better than anybody understands,\" Trump said. \"It's one or the other. And either one is unacceptable.\"\u00a0He later said Obama is either not tough and smart or has \u201csomething else in mind.\u201d Obama, speaking in the Oval Office after getting briefed on the investigation by top officials, said the U.S. has to go after terror groups and \u201chit them hard.\u201d He also said the U.S. needs to make it harder for those who wish to inflict harm to obtain weapons. Meanwhile, Obama said while the investigation is at the preliminary stages, \u201cWe see no clear evidence that he was directed externally.\u201d Rather, Obama said it appears the gunman was inspired by extremist information on the Internet. Speaking Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Clinton directly rejected Trump's criticism on their approach to terror attacks. \u201cI think Trump, as usual, is obsessed with name-calling and from my perspective, it matters what we do, not what we say,\" she said. \"It matters that we got bin Laden, not what name we called him. But if he is somehow suggesting I don't call this for what it is, he hasn't been listening.\u201d Clinton called the attack an \u201cact of terror\u201d on Sunday, as did Obama. But unlike Obama, who did not use the term \"radical Islam,\" Clinton elaborated on Monday and addressed some of the religious motivations. \u201cI have clearly said that we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to stop them and we will. We have to defeat radical jihadist terrorism, and we will. And to me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing. \u201cI'm happy to say either, but that's not the point. \u2026 I'm not going to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\u201d Clinton, who spoke as well on CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning,\u201d also said she would push for laws that prevent people on America's no-fly list from buying weapons. She also urged tougher restrictions on \"weapons of war,\" like the assault-style rifles used in Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif. \u2013 while saying she would set up a federal team dedicated exclusively to addressing \"lone wolf\" attacks. Trump later claimed credit on Twitter for Clinton referring to radical Islam. The attack has only fueled tensions in the 2016 race, as both Trump and Clinton launch into a general election battle after having effectively clinched their respective nominations. Trump has tried to cast Clinton as weak on security issues, while the presumptive Democratic nominee has described Trump as unfit to lead. Clinton will attend a campaign event in Ohio later Monday, while Trump is scrapping plans to make an anti-Clinton speech and instead delivering an address focused on terrorism, security and immigration Monday afternoon in New Hampshire. Trump told Fox News he\u2019ll be calling for strength, and calling for intelligence improvements in his speech. Further, of those in America \u201csick with hate,\u201d Trump said they need to be reported. \u201cNobody\u2019s reporting these people,\u201d he said.

Louisiana\u0092s deep, persistent budget troubles are endangering the future of medical training programs. Proposed cuts to hospitals could damage the stream of new doctors for a generation, in a state that has chronic shortages of health care workers and some of the worst health care outcomes in the nation.  (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) Immigration has been much in the news lately, with the Supreme Court deadlock blocking President Obama\u2019s immigration reform program, California\u2019s move to try to extend participation in their state health exchange to undocumented immigrants, and the continuing prominence of immigration as both a presidential election issue and a source of international turmoil. One aspect often lost in the headlines is just how challenging it can be for immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to get health insurance in the United States. The complexity of the nation\u2019s health care system can be daunting for consumers in general. The complexity is magnified for immigrants\u2014many of whom have difficulty communicating in English, work for low wages at jobs that do not offer health coverage and may face a welter of legal obstacles to acquire it on their own. As a neutral, independent nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing transparency to healthcare costs and health insurance information, FAIR Health takes no position on immigration issues. We do, however, try to demystify health insurance for everyone, including immigrants. For that reason, we prepared a new segment (available in both English and Spanish) in our ongoing series of FH\u00ae Health Insurance 101 articles called, \u201cImmigration and Health Insurance Coverage: What Are Your Options?\u201d The FH Health Insurance 101 series explains our health insurance system to consumers in a way that is both useful and easy to understand. Our new immigration article presents a map for immigrants of the challenging pathway to getting covered. For immigrants lucky enough to be covered by their employer\u2019s health plan, getting insured is relatively easy. For those who can afford to buy health insurance directly from an insurer or broker, it is also fairly simple. For others, it may be complicated or impossible. Consider first the documented immigrants\u2014those who are US citizens or, in the federal government\u2019s terminology, are \u201clawfully present.\u201d Those include green card holders (lawful permanent residents), people who have been granted asylum (asylees), refugees and other individuals on a long list of immigration statuses. Those immigrants, like most other Americans, are required to have health insurance or pay a penalty on their taxes. They can buy coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act, but they have to prove their immigration status with highly technical documentation. Depending on factors such as income, US citizens and immigrants considered \u201cqualified non-citizens\u201d may be eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). But, many qualified non-citizens have to wait five years after getting their qualified immigration status before they can get Medicaid or CHIP. As for Medicare, immigrants turning 65 have to have been lawfully present for at least five years to be eligible. Now consider the country\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. They are not allowed to use the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicare, or, in many states, Medicaid or CHIP. (An exception is made for emergencies, for which even undocumented immigrants may be eligible for emergency Medicaid benefits.) Rules about Medicaid and CHIP differ from state to state, and in some states and cities some undocumented immigrants may be eligible for some kind of public health insurance. But finding out the details in their particular location can be difficult\u2014especially since undocumented immigrants often are wary of approaching any government agency, for fear that reporting their status will get them deported. To complicate matters, immigrant families often include members with different immigration statuses. An undocumented mother may have a child who is a U.S. citizen. The mother in such a case can apply to the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid or CHIP for coverage just for the child, without having to disclose her own immigration status. In practice, however, children born in the United States to undocumented parents are three times more likely to be uninsured than other US-born children. Because undocumented immigrants face such obstacles in obtaining health insurance, they often avoid going to the doctor, and may end up costing taxpayers more when conditions that could have been prevented or treated early become expensive emergency cases. Those without health insurance often depend on a \u201csafety net\u201d of free or low-cost care at Federally Qualified Health Centers, migrant health centers and public and nonprofit hospitals. FAIR Health does not advocate any particular policy. But we hope that presenting the facts about immigrants and health insurance will help individuals concerned about insurance and their access to care and will contribute to a better informed and healthier population.",

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream reports from Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked President Obama\u2019s immigration executive actions, in a tie decision that delivers a win to states challenging his plan to give a deportation reprieve to millions of illegal immigrants. The justices' one-sentence opinion on Thursday marks a major setback for the administration, effectively killing the plan for the duration of Obama's presidency. The judgment\u00a0could have significant political and legal consequences in a presidential election year highlighted by competing rhetoric over immigration. As the ruling was announced, pro-immigration activists filled the sidewalk in front of the court, some crying as the ruling became public. Critics of the policy touted the decision as a strong statement against \"executive abuses.\" \"The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws\u2014only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, adding that the ruling rendered Obama's actions \"null and void.\" Obama, though, said the decision \u201ctakes us further from the country that we aspire to be.\u201d He stressed that earlier changes his administration made to immigration policy are not affected, but acknowledged his most recent 2014 changes cannot go forward and additional executive actions are unlikely. While Obama accepted the ruling, he also made his own full-court press, saying the split decision underscores the importance of the current court vacancy and the appointment of a successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to \"break this tie.\" So far, Senate Republicans have not considered Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. \"The court's inability to reach a decision in this case is a very clear reminder of why it's so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench,\" he said Thursday at the White House. The 4-4 tie vote sets no national precedent but leaves in place the ruling by the lower court. In this case, the federal appeals court in New Orleans said the Obama administration lacked the authority to shield up to 4 million immigrants from deportation and make them eligible for work permits without approval from Congress. Texas led 26 Republican-dominated states in challenging the program Obama announced in November 2014. Congressional Republicans also backed the states' lawsuit. The decision lands in the middle of a heated election season in which immigration is a central issue. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, won the primaries while railing against Obama administration immigration policies as dangerous. Democrats have, in turn, called his rhetoric racially divisive while defending the administration's move to expand existing programs that would effectively give temporary legal status to some undocumented residents. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton countered Ryan's statement saying the decision was \"purely procedural\" and leaves \"no doubt\" the programs were within the president's authority. Referencing the 4-4 split on the court, she again urged the Senate to give Obama's nominee to fill the remaining court vacancy a vote. \"Today\u2019s deadlocked decision from the Supreme Court is unacceptable, and show us all just how high the stakes are in this election,\" Clinton said in a statement. The immigration case dealt with two separate Obama programs. One would allow undocumented immigrants who are parents of either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to live and work in the U.S. without the threat of deportation. The other would expand an existing program to protect from deportation a larger population of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Obama decided to move forward after Republicans won control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, and the chances for an immigration overhaul, already remote, were further diminished. The Senate had passed a broad immigration bill with Democratic and Republican support in 2013, but the measure went nowhere in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. The states quickly went to court to block the Obama initiatives. Their lawsuit was heard initially by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas. Hanen previously had criticized the administration for lax immigration enforcement. Hanen sided with the states, blocking the programs from taking effect. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled for the states, and the Justice Department rushed an appeal to the high court so that it could be heard this term. Texas officials hailed the decision Thursday. \u201cThe action taken by the President was an unauthorized abuse of presidential power that trampled the Constitution, and the Supreme Court rightly denied the President the ability to grant amnesty contrary to immigration laws,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement. \"Today's ruling is also a victory for all law-abiding Americans\u2014including the millions of immigrants who came to America\u00a0following the rule of law.\" Fox News' Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "GOP nominee explains his plans for vetting procedures America, we were introduced to our next president on Wednesday night. He\u2019s not a politician. He is one of a kind. He is an American. Welcome President Donald J. Trump. I\u2019m a cynical Jewish Ivy Leaguer from New York. Nothing gets me too excited. I don\u2019t believe politicians. Nor do I believe in politicians. I don\u2019t fall for theatrical political productions. I don\u2019t believe rhetoric or propaganda. And I\u2019ve never teared up over a political speech in my life. Until now. . . Wednesday night I found myself fist-pumping. I found myself chanting along with the crowd \u201cUSA, USA, USA.\u201d And as the procession of mothers and fathers came up to the podium to state the name of their child -- who was murdered by illegal immigrants -- and then say \u201cI\u2019m voting for Trump\u201d or \u201cTrump is our last chance to save America\u201d I found myself tearing up. And the amazing thing is\u2026 I\u00a0couldn't stop. The tears rolled down my face. This speech in Arizona was the game-changer. Not just the speech, but the entire day. Trump accepted the invitation to meet with the President of Mexico. He showed he\u2019s a man of action by flying to Mexico on a moment\u2019s notice. Trump stood next to Mexico's president -- looking to all the world like President Donald J. Trump. Trump stated his case and never gave an inch to the president of Mexico. Trump turned a vision -- that was mocked and ripped to shreds for a year now -- into a reality. Who now believes that if Trump is elected a wall won\u2019t be built? As a conservative, I\u2019ve waited a lifetime for this speech. Why? Because it was a speech that didn\u2019t back down by even one inch. It was a speech aimed at Americans, for Americans, delivered by a proud American, who values American exceptionalism. It was a speech that restores law and order. A speech that always put American citizens, workers and taxpayers first. A speech that recognized the right to safety and security for American citizens. A speech that recognizes that a foreigner here illegally does not have the same rights as an American-born citizen. A speech that pointed out that foreigners here illegally should not be treated better than our veterans. A speech that recognized that American citizens have every right to choose who comes into our country. And that we should proudly choose immigrants with skills, self-sufficiency and a respect for our common values. It was a speech that recognized that illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps and other entitlements -- and our government has a right, for the first time ever, to prioritize the deportation of illegal foreigners for abusing the welfare system. It was a speech that recognized that foreigners in American prisons for violent crimes and felonies should and will be deported immediately -- and that no country can refuse to take them back. It was a speech that recognized our right to practice \u201cextreme vetting\u201d on anyone who wants to come into America -- and that we can choose to exclude those who don\u2019t share or respect our values, customs, laws and Constitution. Some people just won\u2019t be allowed in. (At this point, I jumped up from my chair and screamed \u201cYES!\u201d) It was also a speech that recognized that the federal government must shut off all funding to Sanctuary cities.\u00a0After all that's our taxpayer\u00a0money being given to political leaders who are choosing to break the law. FINALLY, an adult has decided to just say \"NO.\" And then there\u2019s the wall\u2026 that great, big, beautiful Trumpian wall. I\u2019ve waited a lifetime to hear that we have a right to build a wall, to protect and secure our borders and keep the bad guys out. Trump covered it all on Wednesday night. He never backed down to pressure from the corrupt mainstream media, billionaire titans, Wall Street moguls, Silicon Valley tech gurus, lawyers, lobbyists, liberals, the GOP establishment, Ivy League know-it-all intellectuals. He gave no quarter to any of them. He changed nothing to appeal to them. I could feel their mouths dropping open in disbelief. Trump is our last chance to save America. To restore law and order. To protect my four beautiful children. To save our economy. To rescue our middle class. We have only one choice. We have only one chance. Look at yourself in the mirror. If you\u2019re American-born\u2026if you\u2019re a taxpayer\u2026if you\u2019re a parent\u2026if you love America\u2026if you agree this is the greatest country in world history\u2026.if you believe we are blessed by God\u2026if you\u2019re horrified at the prospect of bringing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into this country at a cost of $400 billion\u2026if you\u2019re scared to death about our soon-to-be-$20 trillion national debt\u2026if you don\u2019t want your child to become just another murder statistic\u2026if any of those descriptions fits you and Trump\u2019s speech didn\u2019t move you\u2026 You suffer from a mental disease called liberalism. If everything Trump promised and everything I\u2019ve just said doesn\u2019t impress you, then just think of Trump as our TREXIT. Trump is a blunt force, all-American, laser-guided middle finger to everything and everyone in Washington, D.C. And that, my fellow Americans, sounds like the dream of a lifetime to me.",

            "article_content": "Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry weighs in on efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities on 'The O'Reilly Factor' SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 San Francisco leaders have retained strict protections for people who are in the country illegally, with clarifications. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday for a measure calling for law officers to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement if a defendant is charged with a violent crime and has been convicted of a violent crime within the past seven years. The measure also allows leeway for the city's sheriff to consider contacting federal immigration authorities in the cases of defendants charged with a felony if they have been convicted of other crimes in the past. The vote Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors came nearly a year after a Mexican national was accused of killing a woman along a popular pier. The slaying sparked a national debate on how to handle criminal suspects in the U.S. illegally. Advocates of sanctuary protections say a clear division between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is needed to foster trust. The law dates back to 1989. The proposal's main sponsor, Supervisor John Avalos, and Sheriff Vicki Hennessy had been deadlocked on the issue for weeks as she sought greater discretion to work with ICE. As a constitutionally elected officer, she does not have to follow board orders. Immigration advocates cheered the compromise, even as they maintained that local law enforcement should be entirely separate from federal immigration authorities. The killing of Kate Steinle in July 2015 and the arrest of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez put San Francisco's leaders on the defensive as critics and outside politicians called for a change in the city's sanctuary law. The sheriff at the time cited the law in defending the release of the man, a repeat drug offender and habitual border-crosser. Then-sheriff Ross Mirkarimi \u2014 already embattled over a number of professional and personal gaffes \u2014 lost re-election to Hennessey, who said she would have considered greater communication between the city and federal government. Hennessey said Tuesday that she would not have contacted ICE in the case of Lopez-Sanchez because he was not wanted on a felony.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The backlog in the federal immigration court system has eclipsed half a million pending cases, The Associated Press has learned. The Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review said Wednesday there are now 500,051 pending immigration cases in the agency's courts. The backlog has been steadily rising in recent years as the number of unaccompanied children and people traveling as families have been caught crossing the Mexican border illegally. Since 2011 more than 200,000 cases have been added to the court's docket and backlog is likely to continue growing. More than 51,000 people traveling as families and more than 43,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala, have been caught crossing the border illegally since the start of the budget year in October. Cases of newly arrived immigrants facing deportation have been made a priority, but the backlog still means that many immigrants are likely to face years long delays before a judge makes a final decision on their cases. And while people are waiting to go before a judge, their case could dramatically change, for good or bad. The president of the union representing immigration judges, Judge Dana Leigh Marks, said multi-year delays are frustrating to immigrants fighting for permission to stay in the United States and the judges hearing those cases. \"As a judge, it's very frustrating because we have to go back to the beginning,\" said Marks, who is a judge in San Francisco. \"It's a more time consuming job, more difficult. It's very different when you (hear a case) within a year, as compared to seven or eight years. Marks said the judges' union has long seen this backlog coming and has pressed for more resources. A spokeswoman for the court system, Kathryn Mattingly, told AP that 18 judges have been added since the beginning of the year and there are now 277 judges hearing cases. She said approximately 100 other judge candidates are in the process of being hired. \"We've been undergoing a robust hiring initiative,\" Mattingly said. She added that a pending budget proposal would allow the court to have as many as 399 judges on staff.",

            "article_content": "The number of families and unaccompanied children apprehended on southern border has skyrocketed, according to new Obama administration stats. David V. Aguilar, the former Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, goes 'On the Record' The Obama administration has spent at least $18.5 million to fly \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d caught crossing into the country illegally to locations inside the United States, according to newly obtained figures. The numbers, shared with FoxNews.com by the Senate subcommittee on immigration, were provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in response to questions from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The numbers shed light on the extent of a program that has drawn scrutiny not just from lawmakers but the federal courts, amid concerns the U.S. government is effectively aiding smugglers. \u201cThis shows how fundamentally flawed our approach to immigration enforcement has been in the Obama administration,\u201d a Senate aide who has seen the questions to and answers from ICE Director Sarah Saldana told FoxNews.com. The administration, which continues to grapple with waves of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and has gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of minors, has defended the practice as appropriate. But it comes with a cost. The ICE figures show that from June 8, 2014 to Sept. 30, 2015, ICE spent $4.8 million on charter flights for the children (ICE could not provide figures before that period). From March 2009 to Sept. 30, 2015, ICE spent $13.7 million on commercial flights for unaccompanied minors utilizing funds appropriated to ICE. In total, the cost reaches at least $18.5 million. \u201cThis admission by ICE demonstrates that the United States is a party to countless conspiracies by illegal aliens to violate our immigration laws, by facilitating their illegal journey into the United States,\u201d the Senate aide said. Past accounts have said children have been flown from the U.S.-Mexico border to live with relatives, many of whom also are in the U.S. illegally. But an ICE official told FoxNews.com on Friday they\u2019re only transporting minors to facilities run by Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement, \u201cas dictated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA).\u201d The official added: \u201cICE does not transport children directly to parents or final destinations. We should also be clear that Congress has appropriated funds for the sole purpose of transporting these unaccompanied minors\u2014that funding is separate from ICE\u2019s enforcement and other funding. ICE is directed in this process by laws that Congress enacts and with funds they appropriate for that specific purpose.\u201d Separate questions to ICE posed by Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 office have yet to be answered. In its written response to Cruz, ICE said it was unable to provide specific data regarding the number of unaccompanied children transported via commercial flight but that it is \u201cin the process\u201d of expanding its use of \u201ccontractor-conducted escorts in FY 2016 and will be able to provide more reliable data going forward.\u201d ICE reported that between June 2014 and September 2015, about 10,000 children were transported by charter flights. ICE has defended its role in transporting illegal immigrant children before -- namely, after U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen complained in a Dec. 13, 2013 order that federal agents were intercepting human smugglers transporting children at the U.S.-Mexico border and then delivering those same children to their parents. He called the practice \"dangerous.\" The comment prompted John Sandweg, ICE\u2019s acting director at the time, to send an email to ICE employees defending the program and saying that the transportation of unaccompanied children by ICE personnel \u201cis appropriate and legal.\u201d Despite its legality, the practice still isn\u2019t sitting well with some. \u201cWhile ICE has spent millions of taxpayer dollars flying these young migrants to ... their chosen destination, it has not taken any action against their illegal alien family members who paid to have them smuggled to the United States,\u201d the Senate source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.",

            "article_content": "In this Aug. 9, 2012, file photo, suspected illegal immigrants are transferred out of the holding area after being processed at the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Tucson, Ariz. (AP) A push to close the country\u2019s privately run or contracted immigration detention centers is drawing fire from lawmakers and law enforcement experts worried that doing so could lead to more overcrowding -- and even amount to a post-election \u201cgift\u201d to public employee unions. The Homeland Security Advisory Council will make recommendations to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Nov. 30 on whether to close the private centers. Johnson announced a review of the sites on Aug. 29, shortly after the Justice Department announced the Bureau of Prisons would reduce and ultimately end the use of privately run federal prisons in response to an audit. However, closing the contracted immigration sites would require an 800 percent expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement capacity, according to ICE. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a need for these private prisons,\u201d Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, told FoxNews.com, citing ICE\u2019s own numbers in saying they\u2019re arresting \u201cmore than 100,000 criminal illegal immigrants.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve registered my concerns [with the administration] and I strenuously oppose closing these private facilities.\u201d While the Obama administration already is moving to end the use of private general-purpose prisons, ending the use of such centers to hold illegal immigrants could have a far bigger impact. While only 10 percent of federal prisoners are in private facilities, about 60 percent of ICE detainees pending deportation procedures are held in contracted facilities. Their population fluctuates, but averages nearly 34,000 per day, according to ICE. Immigration rights activists originally asked President Obama in August to close down those detention centers. But there could be another factor at play. Matthew Vadum, senior vice president for the Capital Research Center, a think tank that investigates liberal nonprofits, said the push is driven to benefit activists and labor unions. \u201cThis will benefit government unions by providing more opportunities for federal workers and expand unions. De-privatizing doesn\u2019t mean shutting down all of these detention centers,\u201d Vadum told FoxNews.com. \u201cSome will be taken over by the government. This is a gift to the labor movement, but first and foremost it\u2019s ideological, based on the de-incarceration movement.\u201d As of August, ICE uses 182 adult detention facilities, only 10 percent of which are federal government-owned. The rest are in contracted facilities, in many cases with local governments such as county jails. This admittedly makes the immigrant centers more complex than the federal prisons, said Jeremy Mohler, spokesman for the liberal group, In The Public Interest, which has long advocated against both private prisons and detention centers. He acknowledged that public employee unions favor closing the centers but said it goes beyond self-interest. \u201cFederal employee unions are interested in having public facilities because that means more union employment in the long run and work conditions will be better,\u201d Mohler told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not just self-interest. Unions are interested in not throwing [immigrant] families into torturous situations.\u201d In The Public Interest is a project of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition of several progressive groups that includes labor unions. The private immigration centers are actually in the interest of the illegal immigrant detainees, contends Gerges Scott, a former deputy secretary for the New Mexico Department of Corrections. \u201cIf DHS closes these detention centers, the detainees will be shipped to overcrowded federal centers,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWomen and children, they will be separated, but they will still be in the same facility with dangerous illegal immigrants. As a former corrections official and taxpayer, this is a concern to me.\u201d During Scott\u2019s time in office from 1999 through 2002, New Mexico was under a federal order to deal with state prison overcrowding and the state legislature was in no mood to build new prisons. So, the state contracted with private prisons, which he said are more accountable and efficient. \u201cPrivate prisons have the same standards and guidelines as federal prisons,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThere is a lot more accountability for private prisons. Union workers in public prisons provide a lot of leniency for their employees. In a private prison, a majority are not unionized, so the oversight is very rigid.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union disputes that assessment. The legal group helped conduct a review that found over a two-year period, six of the eight deaths attributable to substandard medical care in the immigration centers were at contract facilities, ACLU staff attorney Carl Takei told FoxNews.com. But, he adds, if the DHS is going to conduct \u201ca meaningful review, it has to tackle ICE\u2019s incarceration policy.\u201d The head of one large private prison operator, GEO Group, Inc., said he welcomes the review. \u201cOur public-private partnership has allowed ICE to transfer services from older public jail facilities that did not meet the most up-to-date national standards to GEO\u2019s highly rated, cost-effective facilities,\u201d said George C. Zoley, GEO\u2019s chairman, in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are confident that this independent review will show that GEO has provided needed, cost-effective services that have resulted in significantly improved safety outcomes for the men and women in ICE\u2019s care and custody.\u201d ICE reportedly has had $1.18 billion in contracts with GEO since 2008. Another private firm, Corrections Corp of America, got $689 million in ICE contracts since 2008. CCA spokesman Jonathan Burns said the company has worked with the federal government for 30 years and also welcomes the review. \"This effort builds on the unfettered, daily, onsite access ICE officials have to our facilities and the thousands of government audits we\u2019re subject to each year,\" Burns told FoxNews.com. \"We\u2019re proud of the quality and value of the services we provide and look forward to sharing that information.\"",

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0Trump tries tricky dismount on immigration - Powell says Clinton tried to \u2018pin\u2019 email story on him - Clinton outraises Trump in battleground states - Power Play: Training Day - Yin, meet Yang TRUMP TRIES TRICKY DISMOUNT ON IMMIGRATION Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are being put to the test. The Republican nominee once famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still stand behind him. He was kidding\u2026up to a point. The dogged support of a plurality of Republican voters propelled him through missteps that would have ended the campaigns of others and on to the GOP nomination. In large part, however, Trump\u2019s supposed apostasies in the primaries were the kinds of gaffes or intemperate statements that didn\u2019t have much to do with why so many voters surged to his side at the start of his campaign. Once you accept Trump as Trump you can get over the kinds of behavior that one would never tolerate in another politician. For instance, Trump is today mean-tweeting the hosts of a cable news morning show. But so what? If Hillary Clinton suddenly did the same thing to the hosts of \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d it would be in the news for days. At this point with Trump, though, it\u2019s just \u201cwhatevs.\u201d Verbal fisticuffs and feuds with individuals already detested by core Trump voters aren\u2019t really much of a test of loyalty, though. The two faults we are most prone to forgive in our friends are their flattery of us and their demonization of our enemies. What if it was a matter of substance? Trump\u2019s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said that the status of Trump\u2019s promised \u201cdeportation force\u201d to round up more than 10 million illegal immigrants and expel them from the United States \u201cto be determined.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty big matzo ball to have hanging out there, especially since it was the, ahem, Trump card, in the Republican primary debate over who could embrace the most draconian policy on illegal immigration. Think back to when \u201canchor babies\u201d and a lot of loose talk about amending the constitution around birthright citizenship -- including that of the junior Senator from Texas \u2013 was in the news. Other Republicans favored a version of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cself-deportation\u201d in which a secure border and internal enforcement measures would drive illegals out of the country. Trump scoffed and touted his plan to round up illegals, famously defending it by invoking \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d from 1954. If Trump were to ditch the deportation force idea, it would not be the first policy point he had walked back, most notably, keeping all Muslims from entering the United States. He then embraced the idea of banning people from countries tied to terrorism before most recently alighting on a more aggressive vetting process for individual Muslims \u2013 essentially the same thing he once decried his rivals for pursuing. That shift doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt Trump with his core supporters and was quite necessary for him to compete in the general election. Trump would be far from the first presidential candidate to \u201cEtch A Sketch\u201d a few problematic points after the primaries. In fact, Trump has advantages in this way that politicians do not. The fervent devotion to his core followers is something that we have not seen for a major party nominee in more than a generation. It\u2019s not so much that they believe him it\u2019s that they believe in him. That gives him latitude in theory to reach out to new voters. But what if the subject is the core of Trump\u2019s issue set: Cleansing America of the scourge of illegal immigrants? The nominee has previously embraced so-called \u201ctouchback amnesty\u201d in which a pathway to citizenship is provided to illegals who first returned to their home countries. So there is evidence, even beyond the Muslim ban, that Trump\u2019s base will overlook policy shifts on the topic. What remains to be seen is whether they will condone Trump reportedly starting the shift in a closed-door meeting with Hispanic leaders. One imagines that Trump\u2019s shifts on the Muslim ban would have been less well received by his base than if they had been telegraphed in private meetings with imams. Conway made her \u201cto be determined\u201d comment after the Trump campaign had vehemently denied reports from individuals in the meeting that the nominee expressed interest in a more \u201chumane and efficient\u201d way to deal with illegal immigrants than mass deportations, suggesting that there are indeed changes to come. Trump has massive advantages in his primary/general pivot that Clinton does not enjoy. Democrats remain highly suspicious of Clinton on issues like trade, national security, and yes, illegal immigration. Like Romney, Clinton will be afforded very little slack by her party\u2019s base. Trump has already enjoyed grace on a scale unknown in modern politics from his legion of followers. One would not think that this shift would be enough to cause a crisis of confidence, but more shifts will be needed. And those shifts will come against a backdrop not of primary victories but rather a tough slog of a general election campaign. In order to win, Trump must broaden, not intensify, his appeal. Given the degree to which Trump\u2019s support hinges on intense contempt for Clinton and the political system it may be enough for him just to be against her. But make no mistake, Trump\u2019s Hispanic outreach and other efforts to normalize will come at a cost to his core brand and reinforce the claim made by his former and current foes that Trump\u2019s candidacy is a \u201ccon.\u201d TIME OUT: CHEESED OFF\u00a0 The Awl: \u201cIf you were to ask a random American what he or she thinks about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), it\u2019s safe to bet they wouldn\u2019t have much to say\u2026And yet, deep within the bowels of the treaty, there\u2019s one clause that could have a profound effect on everyday American life\u200a\u2014\u200aby making it illegal for US cheese makers to use common names rooted in regional European culinary traditions like feta, muenster, or parmesan.

            "article_content": "GOP nominee explains his plans for vetting procedures Donald Trump began his immigration speech Wednesday by promising a \u201cdetailed policy address\u201d rather than a rally speech.\u00a0 It is true that he provided a bit more detail in the ten points he recited before a crowd in Arizona than he has listed on his website since last fall but most of the additional detail came in the form of a chorus of talking points from anti-immigration hardline groups. His policy proposals were a wish-list of the \u201cenforcement only\u201d approach that has been tried, and failed, for the past twenty years.\u00a0 In fact, the entire speech was a full-throated endorsement of the immigration restrictionists\u2019 approach to the immigration debate.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s vision of America is not a shining city on a hill, but a city under siege from dark forces. Trump\u2019s speech provided no \u201cpivot\u201d to a more reasonable immigration policy, and explicitly shut down the possibility of a path to legal status for any immigrant who has overstayed a visa or has entered without authorization. \u00a0It is here that the contradiction at the heart of the \u201cenforcement only\u201d immigration policy lies.\u00a0 What Mr. Trump failed to mention is that we have 11 million people living without legal status in the United States precisely because there are vanishingly few routes through which they can obtain legal status under current law, but there is significant demand from American employers for their work, and from American communities for their contributions. If we are going to \u201cenforce all of our immigration laws,\u201d which provide no path back to legal status regardless of how good a person is or how long they have lived in the United States, then it does not matter how \u201cfair, just and compassionate\u201d the deportation process is.\u00a0 At the end of that process, with no path to legal status, families will be torn apart and American communities will be devastated. Few people discussing the immigration issue today highlight the law at the root of this current immigration dilemma.\u00a0 In 1996, shortly after Pete Wilson won reelection as governor of California on a strongly anti-immigration platform, the Republican-controlled Congress passed, and Democratic President Bill Clinton signed, a bill called the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, or IIRIRA.\u00a0 It is that bill which closed of many of the paths people had been able to use to \u201cget legal\u201d if they had fallen out of status.\u00a0 It created a \u201cone strike and you are out\u201d rule of deportation for a broad range of nonviolent crimes, and it gave sweeping powers to the immigration agencies to deport and remove suspected undocumented immigrants with only limited legal process. From 2002 to 2006, a \u201cno tolerance\u201d immigration policy was imposed within the immigration agencies, and local police departments were given the unfunded mandate of enforcing immigration law through 287(g) agreements.\u00a0 Mr. Trump promises to return to these policies with a vengeance, forgetting that they were ended because police departments wanted them to end due to the damage they did to police-community relations. It is no surprise that one of the speakers introducing Mr. Trump was the Maricopa County Sherriff, Joe Arpaio, who was recently referred for criminal prosecution for his disregard of a federal judge\u2019s order to cease the unconstitutional profiling of U.S. citizens and legal residents who are Latino. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech peddled the fantasy that doubling down on these failed policies will miraculously end crime and unemployment mere months after his election.\u00a0 Twenty years after IIRIRA was passed, these enforcement-only approaches to immigration control have resulted in more than twice as many people without status (5 million in 1996, 11 million today), and a California completely controlled by the Democratic party.\u00a0 The National Review recently suggested rebranding this approach as \u201cenforcement first,\u201d doubling down on the enforcement-only approach with the goal of having as many people as possible self-deport before discussing any path to legal status for those who remain. The enforcement-only or enforcement-first approach ignores two fundamental realities: 1. A majority of Americans support a path to legal status for many of the people presently without one. 2. Unless immigration law provides both workable paths for legal immigration and credible enforcement against those who do not follow those paths, it will not be sustainable.\u00a0 At present, our immigration laws fail to provide such workable paths. After the election, Republicans will have to decide on a path forward with regard to immigration. If Mr. Trump wins the election, they will be asked to go along with his plans for building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, to grant significant additional funding to immigration enforcement agencies, and to federalize local police to assist with enforcement of immigration laws in their communities. If he does not win, there will be an opportunity for us to define a different path forward, one which recognizes that those immigrants Mr. Trump referred to just last week as \u201cgood people\u201d need a path under our laws to legal status and full integration in our communities. We should seize that opportunity to enact laws that resolve the contradiction at the heart of \u201cenforcement only\u201d policies, provide such a path for the \u201cgood people,\u201d and continue the American tradition of welcoming and assimilating immigrants from around the world.",

            "article_content": "More than 800 illegal immigrants from countries of concern who were set for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship because the Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t have their fingerprints on file, according to an internal audit released Monday. The Homeland Security Department\u2019s inspector general found the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration. In the case of 858 immigrants from \"special interest countries or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud,\" the discrepancies weren\u2019t caught because their fingerprints were missing from government databases. A few even managed to get aviation or transportation worker credentials, though they were later revoked. One became a law enforcement officer. The findings were released, incidentally, as authorities were investigating a string of weekend attacks, allegedly connected to foreign-born suspects. The inspector general report could further fuel warnings about immigration security. The report warned that when immigrants become naturalized, \"these individuals retain many of the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship, including serving in law enforcement, obtaining a security clearance, and sponsoring other aliens\u2019 entry into the United States.\" The tally in the report was provided by the administration in mid-2014. But the problem could be even worse. According to the audit, as of November 2015, the administration has found 953 more \"who had final deportation orders under another identity and had been naturalized,\" some of whom were from countries of concern. DHS Inspector General John Roth also\u00a0found fingerprints missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants' files to add fingerprints to the digital record. \u201cThis situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,\u201d Roth said. \u201cTo prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, USCIS needs access to these fingerprint records.\u201d Roth added that DHS has agreed to the recommendations made in the audit and that ICE has plans to \u201creview the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal a deportation order under a different identity.\u201d The gap in fingerprints was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn't consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated. Roth's report said federal prosecutors have accepted two criminal cases that led to the immigrants being stripped of their citizenship. But prosecutors declined another 26 cases. ICE is investigating 32 other cases after closing 90 investigations. ICE officials told auditors the agency hadn't pursued many of these cases in the past because federal prosecutors \"generally did not accept immigration benefits fraud cases.\" ICE said the Justice Department has now agreed to focus on cases involving people who have acquired security clearances, jobs of public trust or other security credentials. Mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone ordered deported can have serious consequences because U.S. citizens can typically apply for and receive security clearances or take security-sensitive jobs. At least three of the immigrants-turned-citizens were able to acquire aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. Their credentials were revoked after they were identified as having been granted citizenship improperly, Roth said in his report. A fourth person is now a law enforcement officer. Roth recommended that all of the outstanding cases be reviewed and fingerprints in those cases be added to the government's database and that immigration enforcement officials create a system to evaluate each of the cases of immigrants who were improperly granted citizenship. DHS officials agreed with the recommendations and said the agency is working to implement the changes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (The Associated Press) Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in Youngstown, Ohio, Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (The Associated Press) COORECTS BYLINE TO JAKE DANNA STEVENS NOT CHRISTOPHER DOLAN - Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wave as they enter Riverfront Sports Complex for a campaign event in Scranton, Pa., Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. (Jake Danna Stevens/The Times &amp; Tribune via AP) (The Associated Press) YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2013 Donald Trump is calling for \"extreme\" vetting of immigrants seeking admission to the United States, but he's offering few specifics about how that might work, how long it might last or how taxpayers would foot the bill. Trump, who had previously called for an unprecedented temporary ban on immigration by Muslims, vowed Monday to overhaul the country's screening process and block those who sympathize with extremist groups or don't embrace American values. \"Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into our country,\" Trump said in a foreign policy address in Youngstown, Ohio. \"Only those who we expect to flourish in our country \u2014 and to embrace a tolerant American society \u2014 should be issued visas.\" The GOP presidential nominee has made stricter immigration measures a central part of his proposals for defeating the Islamic State \u2014 a battle he said Monday is akin to the struggle against communism during the Cold War. He called for parents, teachers and others to promote \"American culture\" and encouraged \"assimilation.\" But he didn't say which countries or regions would be subject to the \"extreme\" vetting, and his announcement that government agencies would create the list suggested that would not happen before the election in November. The candidate's aides said federal agencies would use questionnaires, social media, interviews with family and friends or other means to vet applicants' stances on issues including religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights. Trump did not clarify how U.S. officials would assess the veracity of responses to the questionnaires or how much manpower it would require to complete such arduous vetting. He did say that implementing the policy overhaul would require a temporary halt in immigration from \"the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism.\" \"We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures,\" Trump said. The address comes during a trying stretch for Trump's presidential campaign. He's struggled to stay on message and build a consistent case against Democrat Hillary Clinton, repeatedly roiling the White House race with provocative comments that have deeply frustrated many in his own party. Clinton has seized on Republican concerns about Trump, highlighting the steady stream of GOP national security experts who've said their party's nominee is unfit to serve as commander in chief. She kept up that argument Monday as she campaigned alongside Vice President Joe Biden in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a working class area where both have family ties. Biden called Trump's views \"dangerous\" and \"un-American.\" He warned that Trump's false assertions last week about President Barack Obama founding the Islamic State extremist group could be used by extremists to target American service members in Iraq. \"The threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks,\" Biden said. Trump has since said he was being sarcastic in accusing Obama of founding the Islamic State. Still, he directly blamed the president and Clinton, who served as Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, for backing policies that \"unleashed\" the group, including withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011. He also challenged Clinton's fitness to be president, declaring she lacks the \"mental and physical stamina\" to take on the extremists. Trump was vague about what he would do differently to decimate the Islamic State in its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. He vowed to partner with any country that shares his goal of defeating the extremist group, regardless of other strategic disagreements, and named Russia as a nation he would like to improve relations with. Russia and the U.S. have been discussing greater coordination in Syria, where the Islamic State is part of a volatile mix of groups fighting for power. But they have been unable to reach an agreement on which militant groups could be targeted. Trump also vowed to end \"our current strategy of nation-building and regime change\" \u2014 a criticism that extends to policies of both parties. He panned the long, expensive Iraq War started under Republican President George W. Bush, as well as Obama's calls for new leadership in some Middle East countries during the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings. Obama has held up Bush's years-long commitment to setting up and securing a new government in Iraq after the initial invasion as a reason to avoid U.S. military intervention in countries like Syria. Trump's most specific anti-Islamic State proposals centered on keeping those seeking to carry out attacks in the West from entering the United States. He said attacks involving \"immigrants or the children of immigrants\" underscore the need to implement \"extreme vetting.\" Trump first announced his call for banning Muslims last year during the GOP primary. He introduced a new standard following the June massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, vowing to \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\" That proposal raised numerous questions that the campaign never clarified, including whether it would apply to citizens of countries like France, Israel, or Ireland, which have suffered recent and past attacks. ___ What political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate Supreme Court appointments, Second Amendment rights and reproductive rights At Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas, Donald Trump showed us that he does know how to prepare for a debate. He just should\u2019ve done it sooner. The evening was by far and away his best performance. Trump hit on all the major themes that his campaign is built upon: economic growth, strong national security, fighting illegal immigration, changing the direction of the country by fighting special interests, corruption and bureaucracy as well as ensuring a Conservative Supreme Court. He had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama\u2019s failed policies at home and abroad. He no doubt took a page out of his running mate Mike Pence\u2019s playbook -- who performed so well in the vice presidential debate just a few weeks ago. Trump had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama\u2019s failed policies at home and abroad. He didn\u2019t go off on too many tangents and while Clinton dished out plenty of red meat to get him to explode, he stayed out of the fray more or less. Trump was certainly more frustrated in the second half of the debate than in the first when he was relatively calm, but this wasn\u2019t close to the explosive Trump we saw in the first debate. It\u2019s just unfortunate that he chose to challenge the veracity of the democratic process in America because that may well be the only thing people remember about this debate. Indeed, when Trump said that he won\u2019t necessarily accept the results of the election he made history as the first major party candidate to say something like this before an election. And history will always look back on this with horror. Not only are Trump\u2019s claims about election rigging unfounded \u2013 studies have shown that 31 instances of voter fraud out of a billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014 \u2013 but they\u2019re incredibly dangerous and preview serious unrest after the election. Comments like this also show why Donald Trump didn\u2019t do anything to turn around the race this evening. He has been bleeding support from white college educated women who are certainly not going to be heading back into his camp after he called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d and told a series of lies about his treatment and statements about women. I also don't see much in his performance that will appeal to independent swing voters who have been moved over to Clinton\u2019s camp because of questions on his judgment and temperament. Saying that he won\u2019t necessarily accept the results of the election does him no good in that arena. And for her part, Clinton was exactly what she needed to be. She was reliable, steady and knowledgeable. She gave strong answers on making the economy work for average Americans and hit him hard on his taxes, foundation and economic plan which would cost America over three million jobs and add trillions to the debt. She was weak on her response to moderator Chris Wallace\u2019s question on her Goldman Sachs speech wherein she said that she wanted a common market by pivoting to Russian hacking. But then again, at this point, it\u2019s only Trump\u2019s base that really cares about these issues. The untrustworthy numbers are baked in and Clinton is still leading by six to eight points. And that is unlikely to change. It follows that we may very well have seen the end of the election on Wednesday night. Trump needed to expand past his base and he most certainly did not do that. All he did was force Republicans to come out in defense of the democratic system in the coming days. That doesn\u2019t win elections.",

            "article_content": "Correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports from Scranton, Pennsylvania Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented \u201cDreamers\u201d into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump\u2019s immigration plans could result in their deportation \u2013 though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. Clinton's national voter registration program, called \"Mi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,\" was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee. Organizers will remind voters that a Trump presidency would end the Dreamer program, according to the campaign, which is already at risk after a June Supreme Court effectively killed Obama's efforts to give legal status to some of the 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The program is part of an aggressive effort by Clinton's campaign to woo the record 27.3 million Latinos eligible to vote in 2016. Polling shows Trump doing worse with Latino voters than any GOP presidential candidate since 1996. Much of the new effort will focus on battleground states including Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina and Florida, where Latinos and other immigrants make up an important part of the voting base. Though Obama's campaign had no formal organization program for Dreamers, door-knocking by those young immigrants, who have lived and attended school in the U.S., helped mobilize many Latino voters who could vote. Clinton believes she can harness their power in a more formal way, particularly given her opponent. Trump's immigration rhetoric has sparked outrage and fear within the Latino community, though the Republican nominee says it's critical that the country start rigorously enforcing its immigration laws. He's promised to revoke Obama's executive orders within the first 100 days of his presidency, calling them the \"most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president.\" Clinton has made revamping the country's immigration system a key plank of her presidential campaign. She has said she will introduce legislation during her first 100 days in office, vowed to restore and expand Obama's programs, close private sector detention centers and to \"take a very hard look at the deportation policies\" now in force. Last month, she called on Latino voters to help stop what she called GOP rival Donald Trump's efforts to \"fan the flames of racial division.\" The following is the full Clinton campaign statement on the latest program, per The Washington Examiner: On DACA's Four- Year Anniversary, Hillary for America Launches National Voter Registration Program, \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" On the four- year anniversary tomorrow when the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' (DACA) enrollment began, Hillary for America is launching a national voter registration program, \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" (My Dream, Your Vote), to organize DREAMers to mobilize their communities and ask voters to consider what is at stake for their families in November. \"DREAMers have played a pivotal role in our campaign, advocating for families who constantly live in fear of deportation \u2014 so we've created a program that aims to turn these stories into action,\" said Lorella Praeli, National Director of the Latino Vote. The program calls on DREAMers across the country to join the campaign's grassroots efforts to secure commitments from their community to vote for their future in November. \"We founded this program on the premise that, one by one \u2014 through friends, families, co-workers or classmates \u2014 DREAMers' futures would be considered on Election day, \" stated Praeli.\" \"We may not have the right to vote, but \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" will help ensure that our stories are heard and it will send a clear signal to Donald Trump that we cannot be silenced,\" said Astrid Silva, Nevada DREAMer and immigrant rights activist. Hillary for America will be holding events across the country this week, including in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina, to unveil the program. \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" will also serve to remind voters of Donald Trump's hateful and dangerous agenda, highlighting his pledge to eliminate DACA and deport millions of DREAMers and immigrant families.

            "article_content": "Terror in America: ISIS and Election 2016 - A look at how the Orlando massacre illustrates the scope and diversity of ISIS' threat and whether Trump and Clinton have the plan to counter the terror group Newly obtained congressional data shows hundreds of terror plots have been stopped in the U.S. since 9/11 \u2013 mostly involving foreign-born suspects, including dozens of refugees. The files are sure to inflame the debate over the Obama administration\u2019s push to admit thousands more refugees from Syria and elsewhere, a proposal Donald Trump has vehemently opposed on the 2016 campaign trail. \u201c[T]hese data make clear that the United States not only lacks the ability to properly screen individuals prior to their arrival, but also that our nation has an unprecedented assimilation problem,\u201d Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told President Obama in a June 14 letter, obtained by FoxNews.com. The files also give fresh insight into the true scope of the terror threat and cover a wide range of cases, including: While the June 12 massacre at an Orlando gay nightclub marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 2001, the data shows America has been facing a steady stream of plots. For the period September 2001 through 2014, data shows the U.S. successfully prosecuted 580 individuals for terrorism and terror-related cases. Further, since early 2014, at least 131 individuals were identified as being implicated in terror. Across both those groups, the senators reported that at least 40 people initially admitted to the U.S. as refugees later were convicted or implicated in terror cases. Among the 580 convicted, they said, at least 380 were foreign-born. The top countries of origin were Pakistan, Lebanon and Somalia, as well as the Palestinian territories. Both Sessions and Cruz sit on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, which compiled the terror-case information based on data from the Justice Department, news reports and other open-source information. The files were shared with FoxNews.com. The files include dates, states of residence, countries of origin for foreign-born suspects, and reams of other details. Specifically, they show a sharp spike in cases in 2015, largely stemming from the arrest of suspects claiming allegiance to the Islamic State. They also show a heavy concentration of cases involving suspects from California, Texas, New York and Minnesota, among other states. EXPLORE THE DATA IN THE MAPS AND CHARTS BELOW The senators say the terror-case repository still is missing critical details on suspects\u2019 immigration history, which they say the Department of Homeland Security has \u201cfailed to provide.\u201d Immigration data the senators compiled came from other sources. Sessions and Cruz asked the president in their letter to order the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State to \"update\" and provide more detailed information. The senators have sent several letters to those departments since last year requesting immigration histories of those tied to terror. \u201cThe administration refuses to give out the information necessary to establish a sound policy that protects Americans from terrorists,\u201d Sessions said in a statement to Fox News. Asked about the complaints, DHS spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen told FoxNews.com the department \u201cwill respond to the senators\u2019 request directly and not through the press.\u201d \u201cMore than 100 Congressional committees, subcommittees, caucuses, commissions and groups exercise oversight and ensure accountability of DHS and we work closely with them on a daily basis. We\u2019ve received unprecedented requests from a number of senators and representatives for physical paper files for more than 700 aliens,\u201d she said, adding that officials have to review each page manually for privacy and other issues. Cruz ran unsuccessfully this year for the Republican presidential nomination. Sessions, an ardent critic of the administration\u2019s immigration policies, is supporting presumptive GOP nominee Trump. The allegations detailed in the subcommittee\u2019s research pertain to a range of cases, involving suspects caught traveling or trying to travel overseas to fight, as well as suspects ensnared in controversial sting operations which civil-liberties groups including the ACLU have criticized. In a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch said nearly half of the federal counterterror convictions at the time came from \u201cinformant-based cases,\u201d many of them sting operations where the informants played a role in the plot. The report said: \u201cIn some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target\u2019s willingness to act.\u201d But even in some of those cases, federal agents got involved after learning of a serious suspected plot. In the case of the Seattle suspect, Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, authorities said he approached someone in 2011 about attacking a military installation. That citizen alerted law enforcement and worked with them to capture Latif and an accomplice. FoxNews.com\u2019s Liz Torrey contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senior adviser Barry Bennett talks trading hits with Hillary Clinton over Orlando attack While investigators try to piece together what led the Orlando gunman to carry out an unspeakable act of terror, the attack is upending the 2016 campaign debate as the two presumptive rivals go toe-to-toe on terror with two very different messages. In back-to-back speeches Monday, Donald Trump doubled down on his call for a Muslim immigration ban while decrying what he described as a \"deadly ignorance\" that is hurting the country -- and Hillary Clinton renewed her call for an assault-weapons ban while vowing to stop \"lone wolf\" terrorists. Trump, speaking in New Hampshire, focused largely on his plans for an immigration crackdown. Trump said he wants to \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism\" against the U.S. or its allies. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d Trump said of the proposed ban.\u00a0It wasn't immediately clear whether Trump was revising his long-standing proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims entering the U.S., which he also defended, or referring to the same plan. The New York businessman also called the Orlando shooting \u201can assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.\u201d \u201cIt we don\u2019t get tough, and we don\u2019t get smart \u2013 and fast \u2013 we\u2019re not going to have a country anymore \u2013 there will be nothing left,\u201d Trump said. Trump, speaking at St. Anselm College, was quick to slam his Democratic rival, claiming she \u201cis in total denial\u201d and that her ultimate plan is to \u201cdisarm law-abiding Americans\u201d while admitting immigrants who could pose a threat. A few hours earlier at her speech in Ohio, Clinton called for an \"intelligence surge\" and a ban on assault weapons as part of a multi-pronged strategy to confront homegrown terrorism. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, following the Orlando terror attack, called on Americans to fight terrorism at home with \u201cclear eyes\u201d and \u201csteady hands.\u201d She delivered a carefully calibrated message, calling for America to get tougher on terrorists while also renewing gun control proposals that have failed to gain steam in Congress. At the Cleveland campaign event, she drew cheers from the crowd after calling for a ban on assault weapons. \u201cWeapons of war have no place on our streets,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton also said if she were in the White House, a top priority would be \u201cidentifying and stopping lone wolves,\u201d like the Orlando shooter. She also called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State messages from the Internet and said \u201cpeace-loving Muslims are in the best position to help fight radicalization.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech was originally supposed to focus on his case against the Clintons \u2013 but Trump changed his focus following the attack in Orlando that left 49 people dead and dozens injured. The gunman died in a shootout with police. On Monday, President Obama said investigators believe the gunman was not directed by external extremist groups, instead saying the shooter \u201cwas inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the Internet.\u201d He added that there is \u201cno direct evidence\u201d the shooter \u201cwas part of a larger plot.\u201d Clinton warned earlier Monday against demonizing an entire religion, saying doing so would play into the hands of the Islamic State group. \"We can call it radical jihadism, we can call it radical Islamism,\" Clinton said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American-Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion.\" The horrific shooting consumed the White House race just as Trump and Clinton were fully plunging into the general election. It served as a reminder to the candidates and voters alike that the next president will lead a nation facing unresolved questions about how to handle threats that can feel both foreign and all too familiar. Trump said Monday he was revoking the press credentials of the Washington Post after the newspaper published an article with a headline \"Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting.\" \"Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post,\" Trump posted on his Facebook page. Authorities identified the killer in Orlando as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American-born Muslim. FBI officials said they had investigated him in 2013 and 2014 on suspicion of terrorist sympathies but could not make a case against him. Mateen opened fire at the Pulse Orlando club with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He called 911 during the attack to profess his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist organization though it was unclear whether he had any direct contact with ISIS or was just inspired by them.

            "article_content": "How will Donald Trump address these unusual tactics? South of the border, Grupo Beta is seen as a humanitarian organization that steers north-bound migrants through the crossfire of warring drug cartels. But in Texas, many view it as part of a pipeline that sends humans and drugs pouring into the U.S., all with the funding and backing of the Mexican government. Grupo Beta, supported by Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Migration, may be the sole bastion of relief for migrants in Tamaulipas state, across the border from the southeast Texas region which includes such cities as Brownsville, Laredo and McAllen. The 25 year-old agency was created to help Tijuana deal with huge numbers of migrants passing through, but has since expanded its reach across both the northern and southern borders of Mexico. Critics say the agency, whose motto \u201cvocation, humanitarianism and loyalty,\u201d is complicit in breaking U.S. laws. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so much crazy stuff out here,\u201d said Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council. \u201cGrupo Beta was formed with good intention but there have been members of the organization caught smuggling.\u201d Three-quarters of U.S.-bound Central American migrants pass through Tamaulipas, according to Grupo Beta spokesman Luis Carlos Cano. The trail is blazed by the infamous rail line known as \u201cLa Bestia,\u201d which regularly chug northward packed with migrants inside and clinging to the roof under an unyielding sun or monsoon rains. Making the trip even more daunting is the ongoing an indiscriminate war between the Gulf and Los Zetas cartels, which most recently resulted in the massacre of 14 in July in the state\u2019s capital of Ciudad Victoria. Grupo Beta provides medical care, food and essentials for those in need and in transit. Supporters of Grupo Beta acknowledge its blemished history, but say in the current climate of mass migration, it serves a vital purpose. \u201cThere was a time early in the organization's development that they appeared to facilitate smuggling of humans and drugs,\u201d said Victor Manjarrez, Center for Law & Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso, and a former U.S. Border Patrol sector chief. \u201cI don't think that is the case now with the exception of a few rogue instances.\u201d When the organization was first created in Tijuana, Grupo Beta officers carried guns and had law enforcement authority, though it was later stripped by the Mexican government. That, according to Moran, lends itself to looking away or even facilitating crime. \u201cThey lost whatever backing they had so now they have no incentive to contact law enforcement if they come across smugglers because of how powerful the cartels are,\u201d he said, adding that he sympathizes with agents who hesitate to get involved in potentially illegal or violent matters when they have no protection. Cano said that regardless of whether an individual is a drug or human trafficker, if they are in need of medical care Grupo Beta will provide it and will not report them to Mexican authorities. \u201cWe provide the assistance and warn them, but then allow them to be on their way,\u201d Cano said. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask questions or judge, we just provide care.\u201d The danger from cartels is real. In the 2010 San Fernando, Tamaulipas massacre, 72 Central and South American migrants were slaughtered by members of the Los Zetas cartel. Grupo Beta tries to educate migrants traveling through Mexico, and steer them to safety. President Obama\u2019s bi-national campaign to discourage migrants, especially those from Central America expecting automatic residence status in the U.S. on the grounds they are fleeing gangs such as MS 13 in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, has had little impact. According to figures from the U.S. Border Patrol there have been no signs the flood of migrants, especially unaccompanied children, will slow. \u00a0And with the political rhetoric on immigration a focal point of the presidential election, Cano said some may be hoping to make it to the U.S. before policies change. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, from October to May in 2015 there were 13,239 unaccompanied children apprehended just in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. That number skyrocketed to 23,243 over the same time span this year. Mexican officials have seen an increase of more than 50 percent in the number of migrants found in distress since the beginning of 2016 compared to the same period last year. The impact of this increase in migration through Mexico is a mixed blessing. Local economies thrive as peddlers sell supplies to migrants and human traffickers known as \u201ccoyotes\u201d spend some of the estimated $5,000 they reap for each client they spirit into the U.S. Mexico has little economic incentive tightening its border, with more than $40 billion coming back into its economy each year from drug sales, remittances sent back to family from individuals in the U.S., and money spent in the local economies by the migrants as they make their way through Mexico. As in the U.S., it is not illegal to leave Mexico, so once Central and South American migrants enter, the issue is essentially controlled by Grupo Beta, which sees its mission as to ensure safe passage. Efforts have been made by Mexico to control the flow of migrants entering its southern border with little impact. Once they make their way north to the U.S. border, Grupo Beta is ready to help. The do not work with Mexico\u2019s own border officials who are technically tasked with deporting the migrants back to Central America unless they request it. Despite the efforts to mitigate immigration, both the U.S. and Mexico realize they must provide humanitarian help, such as water stations, medical care and shelter when emergencies arise, regardless of the political environment or rhetoric of politicians. On the American side, the U.S. Border Patrol has a special search and rescue unit known as BORTSAR (Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue) whose mission is to rescue lost, ill or injured migrants. In the span of one week from June 13 to June 20, 2016, Laredo Sector Border Patrol alone rescued 87 illegal immigrants. \u201cThe smugglers will leave these immigrants to die,\u201d Mario Martinez, chief patrol agent of the Laredo Sector Border Patrol, said in a press release. \u201cTemperatures will only get hotter and they have to understand that it is a dangerous trek to enter this country illegally.\u201d The 1998 Border Safety Initiative encourages the U.S. Border Patrol to prevent deaths and increase rescues of illegal immigrants who fall prey to \u201ccallous, unscrupulous human smugglers who place them in dangerous situations to fend for themselves with the proviso that these individuals will be processed upon apprehension.\u201d Moran said the Border Patrol\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump came largely on the strength of his pledge to secure the border and stem the flow of drugs and migrants coming across the U.S. border. \u201cMexico does what it wants, when it wants,\u201d Moran said. \u201cMaybe that will change.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP candidate explains his latest policies and strategies on 'The O'Reilly Factor' Donald Trump told Fox News on Monday he wants to have a \u201cfirm, but fair\u201d stance on illegal immigration, amid signs the Republican presidential nominee may be rethinking his approach on the hot-button campaign issue. Trump\u2019s newly installed campaign team has suggested in recent days possible changes in the candidate\u2019s tough immigration proposals. The nominee\u00a0had been scheduled to deliver a speech on the topic Thursday in Colorado, but has postponed it. In an interview Monday night on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d Trump said: \"I just want to follow the law.\u201d \"The first thing we're gonna do, if and when I win, is we're gonna get rid of all of the bad ones. We've got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. We're gonna get them out,\" he said. \"As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process,\" he said, while citing the policies of President Obama and former President George W. Bush as examples. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the same thing. We\u2019re going to do it in a humane manner,\u201d Trump said, adding that the \u201cbad ones\u201d are known by law enforcement. Asked whether\u00a0Trump's\u00a0plan still included a deportation force, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Sunday it was \"to be determined.\" \"Even Sen. Jeff Sessions,\" a hard-liner on immigration, \"he doesn't deport 11 million people in his plan,\" Conway said on CNBC. There have been signs for weeks now that\u00a0Trump\u00a0may be shifting course. Hispanic business and religious leaders who would like to see\u00a0Trump\u00a0move in a more inclusive direction have reported closed-door conversations with\u00a0Trump\u00a0in which they say he has signaled possibly embracing a less punitive immigration policy that focuses on \"compassion\" along with the rule of law. At last month's GOP convention, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic communications, Helen Aguirre Ferre, told reporters at a Spanish-language briefing that\u00a0Trump\u00a0had already said he \"will not do massive deportations\" \u2014 despite the fact that\u00a0Trump\u00a0had never said so publicly. Instead, Aguirre Ferre said, \"he will focus on removing the violent undocumented who have criminal records and live in the country.\" Indeed,\u00a0Trump's\u00a0first television ad of the general election specifically singles out illegal immigrants with criminal records, claiming that, if Clinton is elected, \"Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay.\" Trump's\u00a0campaign has pushed back on the notion that he's reversing course. \"Mr.\u00a0Trump\u00a0said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech,\" rapid response director Steven Cheung said after the meeting.

In the push to grant illegal immigrants driver\u2019s licenses, Californians had been assured that doing so would spur them to get safety training and insurance coverage. Nearly a year-and-a-half later, there\u2019s no evidence it worked. \u201cIt is hard to pinpoint whether the bill has had an impact or not,\u201d said Jeffrey Spring, spokesman for the American Automobile Association\u2019s California chapter. \u201cWe have no way of knowing.\u201d Brawley felt fortunate she was not hurt, but left with expensive repairs. The law, and a three-year, $141 million program designed to implement it, did not provide for a way to measure if illegal immigrants are any more inclined to buy insurance. \u201cThere are no statistics regarding how many new license holders under AB 60, purchased vehicle insurance,\u201d said California Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Artemio Armenta. \u201cWe cannot relate our vehicle insurance data to driver licenses because the vehicle registration information is only associated with individual vehicles and cannot be used to identify any trends related to AB 60. Drivers under AB 60 are not tracked or singled out any differently.\u201d More than 600,000 illegal immigrants got driver's licenses iin 2015. (Associated Press) \u201cThe DMV cannot relate our vehicle insurance data to driver licenses because the vehicle registration information is only associated with individual vehicles and cannot be used to identify any trends to AB 60,\u201d Armenta said. The DMV estimates that at least 1.4 million drivers will apply for a license over the next three years. As of March, the state had issued approximately 696,000 driver\u2019s licenses under the program. The program does not compel them to get auto insurance, and even if they get the coverage required to register a vehicle, they could stop paying premiums as many drivers do. \"I\u2019m sure some drivers bought insurance before they took their test but in many cases they just don\u2019t pay the next month and it\u2019s canceled,\" said anti-illegal immigration activist Don Rosenberg, whose son Drew was killed in 2010 in San Francisco by an unlicensed, uninsured driver who had entered the country illegally but was granted protective status. The law was part of a bundle of immigration measures designed to make California friendlier toward illegal immigrant residents. The state hired 1,000 temporary DMV workers, opened four new processing centers and extended hours in an effort to deal with the anticipated inundation onf the system \u2013 which was reportedly even higher than expected \u2013 as almost half a million applications came through in the first three months alone. It was clear that illegal immigrants wanted driver\u2019s licenses, but there is scant evidence supporters of the law were correct in saying it would spur them to get insurance. If licensed illegal immigrants want to buy auto insurance, the state provides a low-cost option. The California Department of Insurance markets the state-sponsored, Low Cost Auto Insurance Program for low income earners through Spanish-language media. Plans provide minimal liability coverage with annual premiums as low as $241. The coverage is less than what is mandated for other drivers who purchase policies through private insurance companies, paying a statewide average of just below $2,000 per year. Some 650,000 licenses were issued to illegal migrants in 2015 alone, and just 11,348 Californians \u2013 some illegal immigrants and some not - bought Low Cost Auto Insurance policies. Rosenberg and other critics say the subsidized insurance pays victims less than regular policies, leaving them with insufficient protection in the case of accidents caused by illegal immigrants, further undermining a major selling point of the law. \u201cPrior to this program California had the worst property damage coverage in the country and was tied for the third lowest payouts for injury or death,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cTo then offer a program that lowers the payouts even further and eliminates the safe driver criteria to enroll is unconscionable.\u201d Private insurance companies targeted advertising to an expected influx of illegal immigrant customers following passage of the law, but several contacted by FoxNews.com said there is no data to suggest such a market ever materialized. Some insurance company officials noted that despite the law\u2019s main selling point being that it would prompt illegal immigrants to get insurance, they were already allowed to by policies for cars they owned even without driver\u2019s licenses. According to the CDI, an estimated 25 insurance companies sold automobile insurance to those who owned cars but did not have a driver's license. \u201cIt is hard to quantify the effect the bill has had on the safety of California roads,\u201d said Mark Sektnan, president of the Association of California Insurance Companies. \u201cBut the summation is that many already had insurance before they could legally get a license.\u201d Possible evidence that more illegal immigrants are getting insurance could be reflected in numbers that show citations for driving without coverage on the decline. According to the California Highway Patrol, just over 92,000 drivers were cited for lacking proof of valid insurance in 2015, down from 105,500 the year before and 112,081 in 2013. But even those figures are inconclusive, as uninsured driver citations were on a downward trend for at least five years prior to passage of AB 60. \u201cThe bottom line is that the public was sold a lie,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cGetting a license does not mean you will get insurance and what little history there is says that most don\u2019t.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from Modesto Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are spending their final weekend in California, before the state\u2019s big primary Tuesday, rallying voters over immigration issues and warning the state\u2019s diverse electorate about the perils of electing Republican Donald Trump. On Saturday, Sanders expressed confidence that he could win a majority of votes next week in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota and North Dakota. However, the Vermont senator acknowledged that he\u2019ll need a high voter turnout, like those that have helped him win previous state contests. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an uphill battle\u201d Sanders said a press conference in Los Angeles, repeating what he has said many times recently. Still, a report Friday by the state that a record 17.9 million Californians, or 72 percent of eligible state voters, are registered to vote in the primaries could help Sanders. Sanders on Saturday also repeated that the front-running Clinton will not have enough pledged delegates after polls close Tuesday to secure the nomination. He said she will have to instead rely on super-delegates, or those who have previously committed to Clinton, to claim the nomination and that he will continue to try to win over those delegates to take the nomination at the party\u2019s convention in July. \u201cWe look forward on Tuesday to doing very well,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThere will be a contested convention. \u2026 Super delegates can and have changed their candidate choice in the past.\u201d He also focused on the issue of immigration, as Clinton did earlier in the day in California, a state that borders Mexico and where Hispanics will be a key voting bloc. Sanders argued that Trump, \u00a0the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, should not be elected because his \u201cbigotry\u201d against Mexicans, Muslims, African-Americans and others \u201ccannot be tolerated.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump cannot be elected president,\u201d Sanders said. He also spoke Saturday to supporters at his campaign headquarters in Los Angeles. Clinton, in a panel discussion in Slymar, Calif., expressed optimism about passing legislation to overhaul federal immigration law. Clinton argued that as U.S. senators she supported bipartisan Senate reform legislation while Sanders did not. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were people from every part of the planet who were so hopeful. \u2026 I believe that after this election, if all goes well, we will have a chance to pass immigration reform.\u201d She also said Trump plans to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, calling such talk \u201cthe most unfair and dangerous kind of conversation\u201d that has veered off \u201ctoward anger and fear.\u201d Other scheduled events for Clinton this weekend included a stop Saturday in Oxnard, Calif. Trump campaigned this week in California, despite having enough delegates to secure the GOP nomination, but held no events Saturday. Some of those events brought violent protests outside the venues. One of California\u2019s most influential daily newspapers, The San Francisco Chronicle, this weekend endorsed neither Clinton, Sanders nor Trump. That the Chronicle wouldn\u2019t endorse Trump was not surprising, consider the editorial board for the paper, in liberal-leaning Northern California, had previously expressed its distaste for what it calls his \u201clow-substance, high-insult candidacy.\u201d The paper was also highly critical of the front-running Clinton, pointing out her refusal to meet with the board and her many fundraising forays in the state. However, the Chronicle declined to back Sanders in the neck-and-neck primary Tuesday, suggesting his \u201caggressively progressive promises\u201d can never be realized with so many Republicans ruling Congress. Two other major California dailies -- The Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union Tribune -- have endorsed Clinton. The Tribune this weekend sarcastically endorsed Ronald Reagan over Trump.",

Trump, speaks during the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Thursday, July 21, 2016. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (The Associated Press) CLEVELAND \u2013 Declaring America in crisis, Donald Trump pledged to cheering Republicans and still-skeptical voters Thursday night that as president he will restore the safety they fear they're losing, strictly curb immigration and save the nation from Hillary Clinton's record of \"death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.\" Confidently addressing the finale of his party's less-than-smooth national convention, the billionaire businessman declared the nation's problems too staggering to be fixed within the confines of traditional politics. \"I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,\" Trump said. The 70-year-old celebrity businessman's acceptance of the Republican nomination caps his improbable takeover of the GOP, a party that plunges into the general election united in opposition to Clinton but still divided over Trump. Underscoring his unorthodox candidacy, Trump doubled down on the hard-line immigration policies that fired up conservatives in the primary but broke with many in his party by promising protections for gays and lesbians. His address on the closing night of the convention marked his highest-profile opportunity yet to heal Republican divisions and show voters he's prepared for the presidency. Ever the showman, he fed off the energy of the crowd, stepping back to soak in applause and joining the delegates as they chanted, \"U-S-A.\" As the crowd, fiercely opposed to Clinton, broke out in its oft-used refrain of \"Lock her up,\" he waved them off, and instead declared, \"Let's defeat her in November.\" Yet he also accused her of \"terrible, terrible crimes\" and said her greatest achievement may have been avoiding prison for her use of a private email and personal server as secretary of state. The more than hour-long speech was strikingly dark for a celebratory event and almost entirely lacking in specific policy details. Trump shouted throughout as he read off a teleprompter, showing few flashes of humor or even a smile. He accused Clinton, his far-more-experienced Democratic rival, of utterly lacking the good judgment to serve in the White House and as the military's commander in chief. \"This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,\" he said. \"But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.\" In a direct appeal to Americans shaken by a summer of violence at home and around the world, Trump promised that if he takes office in January, \"safety will be restored.\" As he moves into the general election campaign, he's sticking to the controversial proposals of his primary campaign, including building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border and suspending immigration from nations \"compromised by terrorism.\" But in a nod to a broader swath of Americans, he said young people in predominantly black cities \"have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America.\" He also vowed to protect gays and lesbians from violence and oppression, a pledge that was greeted with applause from the crowd. \"As a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said,\" he responded. Trump was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, who announced a childcare policy proposal that the campaign had not mentioned before. \"As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in place at a time when women weren't a significant portion of the workplace, and he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all,\" she said. Trump took the stage in Cleveland facing a daunting array of challenges, many of his own making. Though he vanquished 16 primary rivals, he's viewed with unprecedented negativity by the broader electorate, and is struggling in particular with younger voters and minorities, groups GOP leaders know they need for the party to grow. The first three days of this week's convention bordered on chaos, starting with a plagiarism charge involving his wife Melania Trump's speech and moving on to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's dramatic refusal to endorse him from the convention stage. Then, Trump sparked more questions about his Oval Office readiness by suggesting in the midst of the convention that the U.S. might not defend America's NATO partners with him as president. The remarks, in an interview published online Wednesday by The New York Times, deviate from decades of American doctrine and seem to reject the 67-year-old alliance's bedrock principle of collective defense. Trump reinforced his position from the convention stage, saying the United States has been \"picking up the cost\" of NATO's defenses for too long. He also disavowed America's foreign policy posture under both Democratic and Republican presidents, criticizing \"fifteen years of wars in the Middle East\" and declaring that \"Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\" \"As long as we are led by politicians who will not put 'America First,' then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect,\" he said. He had promised to describe \"major, major\" tax cuts. But his economic proposals Thursday night were vague, centering on unspecified plans to create millions of jobs. He promised a \"simplified\" tax system for the middle class and businesses, fewer regulations and renegotiation of trade deals that he says have put working class Americans at a disadvantage. At every turn, Trump drew sharp contrasts with Clinton, casting her as both unqualified for the presidency and too tied to Washington elites to understand voters' struggles. Democrats will formally nominate Clinton at their convention next week in Philadelphia. She is on the verge of naming a running mate to join her in taking on Trump and his vice presidential pick, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in the general election. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine has emerged as her top choice. ___ AP writers Kathleen Hennessey, Josh Lederman, Alan Fram and Thomas Beaumont in Cleveland, and John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",

            "article_content": "The Republican nominee is fighting to unite the party Voters say the top issues facing the country are the economy and terrorism. They think Donald Trump will handle one of them better than Hillary Clinton, while the candidates tie on the other. A new Fox News Poll on the 2016 election finds more voters trust Trump than Clinton on the economy (+5 points). He also bests Clinton on handling the federal deficit (+5 points). Those are the only issues where he comes out on top. It\u2019s a draw on \u201cterrorism and national security,\u201d as the candidates receive 47 percent apiece. In May, Trump led Clinton by 12 points on doing a better job on \u201cterrorism\u201d (52-40 percent). Equal numbers of voters say the economy and terrorism are the most important issues facing the country today (22 percent each). Education is the only other one to receive double-digit mentions (11 percent). Here\u2019s the rest of the list: race relations (9 percent), the federal deficit (5 percent), health care (5 percent), climate change (4 percent), immigration (3 percent), foreign policy (3 percent), and drug addiction (2 percent). Clinton beats Trump by wide margins on education (+23 points), and on the lower priority concerns: climate change (+31 points), race relations (+28 points), drug addiction (+19 points), foreign policy (+16 points), and health care (+11 points). She also has the advantage on one of Trump\u2019s signature issues -- immigration (+7 points). Who would do better picking the next Supreme Court justice? That\u2019s a hot topic this election. Voters trust Clinton over Trump by eight points. They also think she\u2019s more likely to \u201cpreserve and protect the U.S. Constitution\u201d (+7 points). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS By a 22-point margin, voters trust Clinton over Trump when it comes to using nuclear weapons (56-34 percent). That\u2019s twice the advantage she held in May (49-38 percent). Yet voters are more likely to trust Trump to destroy terrorist groups like ISIS (+9 points). The candidates now tie on restoring trust in government (43-43). That\u2019s a shift since May when Trump had an eight-point advantage (46-38 percent). Despite Trump\u2019s claim that he understands the concerns of everyday Americans, Clinton bests him on empathy. By a 51-40 percent margin, voters say she\u2019ll do a better job looking out for their family during tough economic times. In June 2012, Barack Obama topped Mitt Romney on this measure by 47-36 percent. Poll-pourri How do voters feel about Trump\u2019s praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin? Fifty-two percent of voters say it\u2019s no big deal. For 44 percent, it\u2019s bothersome. Most Republicans say it\u2019s no big deal (72 percent), while two-thirds of Democrats say it bothers them (66 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,022 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from July 31-August 2, 2016. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton discuss Clinton's handling of classified emails, lowering health care costs and the fate of ObamaCare It\u2019s a strange time to be in St. Louis. For the first time since 2010, the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs. The St. Louis Rams are no more, having returned to their Los Angeles past. Maybe strangest of all: the political Shocktoberfest that is the 2016 presidential election, culminating in the second debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the city\u2019s Washington University. Between Friday\u2019s release of the 2005 video laced with Trump vulgarities and the WikiLeaks data dump of Clinton campaign emails and the candidate\u2019s Wall Street speech excerpts, this debate didn\u2019t lack for build-up. To say nothing of morbid curiosity: a pre-debate survey of Washington University students came up with this summation: \u201ca gruesome debate about who is more an enabler of sexual assault.\u201d Sure enough, a question about the video was brought up, right out of the chute, by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Trump admitted embarrassment, but quickly dismissed it as \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d Cooper pushed him on the subject \u2013 was he a groper, did he force himself on women? \u2013 but Trump wouldn\u2019t play along. Clinton, however, did. She questioned Trump\u2019s fitness for the job, then branched out from the video to past Trump comments about immigrants, African-Americans, POW\u2019s and those with disabilities. \u201cThe question our county must answer is this is not who we are.\u201d The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn\u2019t make the trip west. And then it got even more personal. Trump referenced the four women in the audience \u2013 Paula Jones, Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willey \u2013 who\u2019ve accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Did Clinton defend her husband? Actually, she invoked Michelle Obama: \u201cwhen they go low, you go high.\u201d Make of that what you will. Then she belittled Trump for failing to make past apologies, after which Trump upped the ante by promising to sic a special prosecutor against Clinton if he\u2019s elected. Mercifully, after 30 minutes of such rancor, the Average Joes (in the audience and on Facebook) got their turn. The highlights: An American Muslim woman asked Trump about what to do about Islamophobia on the rise. Trump called for the Muslim community to work more closely with law enforcement. Clinton went into a broader talk about defeating ISIS. That segued into one of Clinton\u2019s weaker moments: defending her plan to expand the Syrian refugee population from 10,000 to 65,000. Clinton invoked a bloodied boy, but couldn\u2019t resist trying to bloody Trump as a recruiting tool for ISIS and chumming the waters yet again over his Iraq war position. (Later, both candidates stumbled through the question of what to do about Aleppo \u2013 Trump sounded na\u00efve; Clinton put herself in a box by ruling out ground forces). Then came the question of the WikiLeaks passage in which Clinton supposedly said a politician sometimes needs \u201ca public and a private position\u201d on certain topics. Hillary tried to make it sound Lincolnesque. Equating Wall Street reform in a paid with the fight to abolish slavery? Sounds like a stretch. The closest anyone got to a question on the economy and tax reform? This query directed at Trump: \u201cwhat specific provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\u201d Two complaints about this debate: The overlap between audience and Facebook question led to a lot of talk about Syria and precious little about the country\u2019s tense mood. Race, the Supreme Court, guns and abortion all were pureed into one serving at the 86-minute mark. And the moderators: CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz were more aggressive in policing Trump\u2019s time and parsing his words (Raddatz, in particular, on Aleppo). Must there always be a question of a fair fight? A funny thing about this race: reports of Trump\u2019s political death may be exaggerated. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted immediately after the controversial audio was released gave Clinton a 42%-38% lead over Trump in a four-way race. Previously, it was 41%-39% in her favor. Something else the poll revealed: only 12% of Republicans think Trump should quit the race; 74% think the GOP establishment should continue to back him. The quandary this presents for Republicans: their nominee is wounded, he struggles to crack the 40% barrier; for down-ticket candidates, shunning the nominee risks alienating the GOP base. I give this debate to Trump. He was in better form than the first encounter in Hofstra. This time around, he wasn\u2019t as clunky when defending his record. Unlike the first debate, when he started strong but fell apart, Trump improved as the night went on. Add to that his decision to bring along the Bill Clinton accusers \u2013 the equivalent of Hillary dropping Alicia Machado on Trump at the end of the previous debate \u2013 and Trump had good night in terms of strategy and surpassing expectations. Clinton\u2019s style and presentation were better than Trump\u2019s \u2013 she seemed visibly more comfortable cradling the mike and approaching the audience. But I\u2019m subtracting points from Clinton for this reason: she could have spent more time on the high road, given Trump\u2019s recent travails, but too often she needlessly threw an elbow. In all, it was an evening that will be hard to forget. Trump thinks Clinton should go to jail. Judging by the look on her face, Clinton would like to condemn Trump to a more subterranean existence \u2013 which is funny, since it\u2019s Trump who thinks Hillary is satanic. And here you thought Hell was that debate stage.",

            "article_content": "Republican strategist John Brabender explains Donald Trump returned Saturday to the heart of his presidential campaign -- promising to stop problems that illegal immigration has created for Americans, after a freewheeling few days in which he flung accusations and attacks at Democratic rival Hillary Clinton over gun control and the President Obama\u2019s citizenship. Trump delivered his law-and-order message to a gathering in Houston of Remembrance Project families, dedicated to helping themselves and others after killings at the hands of illegal immigrants. \u201cYour stories are not featured in the news. You have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf. You have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will,\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said amid more recent polls showing him essentially deadlocked with Clinton in the White House race. A Fox News poll released Thursday shows Clinton ahead of Trump by just 1 percentage point among likely voters in a four-way ballot. Clinton receives 41 percent and Trump 40 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 8 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 3 percent. In the head-to-head matchup with Clinton, Trump leads by 1 percentage point. Clinton, whose single-digit lead has slipped since mid-August, spoke Saturday evening in Washington, D.C., at a Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s awards dinner, her third day on the campaign trail after taking off a few days to recover from pneumonia. Trump, a first-time candidate, nabbed the GOP nomination from a field of experience politicians in large part with a tough immigration stance that included a vow to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d along the southern border to keep out dangerous illegal immigrants and to deport the estimated 11 million people now living illegally in the U.S. After struggling in recent weeks to find an immigration policy that would appeal to voters in the general election, Trump has essentially returned to his hardline positions, while trying to portray Clinton, a former secretary of state, as soft on illegal immigration. \u201cThe matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton\u2019s (State Department) desk,\u201d Trump said Saturday. \u201cBut she failed to take forceful action and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don\u2019t take back their citizens.\u201d He also said she has declined Remembrance Project\u2019s offers to meet and argued Clinton, if elected, would extend President Obama\u2019s \u201copen border\u201d polices and attempts to delay deportation through executive action. \u201cShe will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHer plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days. \u2026 \u00a0Sanctuary Cities, ignoring visa overstays, closing detention centers and a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States.\u201d His comments follow a wild past few days in which the Clinton and Trump camps exchanged attacks -- with Trump again using innuendo to go after Clinton and attract free publicity. On Wednesday, Trump declined to say definitively that President Obama was born in the United States -- roughly eight years after stoking controversy about his citizenship, then dropping the issue in 2011 when the president made public his birth certificate documents. Trump on Friday declared the issue over, but not before suggesting that the Clinton campaign, in its hard-fought 2008 Democratic presidential primary against Obama, was pushing the rumor that he was born in Kenya. Clinton said on Twitter that Trump pushing the birther issue was \u201cdeplorable.\u201d And on Saturday, the campaign told Fox News that neither Clinton nor the 2008 campaign suggested Obama was born outside of the U.S. Trump also made the statement at the end of a campaign event at his new luxury hotel in Washington, D.C. -- after suggesting beforehand to expect a \u201cmajor announcement.\u201d And he mused aloud about what might happen if Clinton\u2019s Secret Service detail no longer carried weapons, an apparent effort to further suggest Clinton, if elected, would further take away Americans\u2019 rights to own guns. \"I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,\" Trump said. \"Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her.\" Trump made a similar suggestion in May about her Secret Service detail. The Clinton campaign denounced the most recent remarks. \u201cThis kind of talk should be out of bounds for a presidential\u00a0candidate,\u201d said campaign manager Robby Mook. \u201cHe is unfit\u00a0to be president, and it is time Republican leaders stand up to denounce\u00a0this disturbing behavior in their nominee.\"",

            "article_content": "William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles Two years ago, the Obama administration referred to the surge of Central American children and families coming into the U.S. as a \"humanitarian crisis.\" This year, it's worse \u2013 as Border Patrol agents apprehend even more Honduran, Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants claiming asylum. But due to a backlog in the courts, there is even less of a chance they\u2019ll be deported. \"Where the backflow and choke point is occurring is in the immigration judge docket system -- 800,000 on the dockets right now,\" said former Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection David Aguilar. \"So, that backlog, that inability to basically send these people back, remove them back to their countries of origin, is causing a draw of more of these people coming into the country.\" According to the latest CBP figures, agents detained 27,754 unaccompanied minors from Central America in the first six months of the fiscal year, almost double last year's total of 15,616 and just shy of the 2014 record of 28,579. The numbers for immigrants traveling as families is even higher, with 32,117 apprehended -- almost triple last year's total of 13,913 and well above the 2014 \u201csurge\u201d figure of 19,830. Taken together, the exodus from Central America\u00a0represents the largest mass immigration to the U.S. since the Mariel boatlift out of Cuba in 1980. \"These people are allowed to remain here. They are given employment authorization -- therefore, they are sending a message back home 'come on over',\" Aguilar said. There are push-and-pull factors to any mass immigration, but agents and immigration experts point to several drivers. Agents are concerned the system, though, is so overwhelmed that few immigrants\u2019 criminal records are adequately checked, endangering the public. \"We don't know who we're releasing and we don't know what they're capable of,\" said Shawn Moran, a Border Patrol agent in California and a member of the union. Fellow agent and union representative Art Del Cueto echoed, \"You can't find out if they've murdered, you can't find out if they've molested minors.\" The immigration rush isn't just at the southern border. According to the Department of Homeland Security, almost 500,000 immigrants who entered the U.S. legally last year overstayed their visa. Yet, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency removed fewer than 3,000 overstays, or less than 1 percent. \"Over 40 percent of the illegal entries, illegal people that stay in the United States come in by visa and just plain overstay,\" said Aguilar. \"So the ability to locate them, to identify them and put them in removal proceedings and very critically remove them as quickly as possible from the country is critical.\" The U.S. does not have the means to easily track visa overstays, despite a law and millions of dollars appropriated by Congress to do so.",

            "article_content": "Senior adviser Tana Goertz sounds off on 'Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro' Top Trump campaign officials on Sunday expressed optimism about recent poll numbers amid the fallout from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s FBI email investigation and sought to defend the Republican presidential nominee's immigration plan in advance of the White House race intensifying after Labor Day. \u201cThe polling data that you showed earlier really tells the tale,\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton is having a hard time being accepted as a truthful and honest candidate vis-\u00e0-vis the American people.\u201d Clinton\u2019s poll numbers have dropped in recent weeks amid further revelations about her use of a private email server while secretary of state and connections between Clinton Foundation donors and the State Department during and after her tenure at the agency. The RealClearPolitics polls average showed Clinton leading Donald Trump by as many as 8 percentage points in mid-August, when the first-time candidate made a series of campaign missteps that some political analysts predicted would be too damaging to overcome. However, the RCP average is now at about 4 points, though Trump trails by larger margins in such key battleground states as Ohio and Pennsylvania. \u201cWe're taking Pennsylvania very seriously,\u201d said Conway, acknowledging Democrats have won there in the past six presidential elections but dismissing the argument that the state is do-or-die for Trump. \u201cWe have several different paths to victory,\u201d she said. The Trump campaign also faced repeated questions Sunday about Trump\u2019s immigration plan, which critics argue is vague on the issues of deportation for illegal immigrants and whether the United States or Mexico will pay for Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the southern U.S. border. GOP vice-presidential nominee Gov. Mike Pence\u00a0said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the plan begins with building the wall for border security and makes a priority of \u201cenforcing the laws of this country,\" including removing \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d and people who've overstayed visas. The Indiana governor also shot back that voters understood the plan, despite repeated questions from some in the media. \"What the American people want to see today is to establish the borders of this country, enforce the laws of this country. And Donald Trump has created a road map to do that,\" said Pence, who bristled at the suggestion that Trump hadn't been definitive enough in explaining his plan. \"Some 10,000 people in Arizona last week, it wasn't the way they see it,\" Pence said. \"As I travel across this country campaigning with Donald Trump and for Donald Trump, I think people hear him loud and clear. And he's been completely consistent on this point.\" Conway faced similar questions -- including one about managing the deportation of millions of people -- after a week in which\u00a0Trump hinted about a possible \u201csoftening\u201d in his immigration stances, met Wednesday with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, then delivered the Arizona speech hours later in which he appeared to return to his hardline positions on immigration. \u201cHe'll manage it the way it should have been managed all along, by enforcing the law and relying upon those law enforcement officers and those (federal immigration) officers to do their job,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut at least you have a presidential candidate putting forth a 10-point plan.\u201d She also criticized Clinton for failing to hold a full-fledged press conference in 274 days and for staying off the campaign trail for several days to fundraise in such wealthy enclaves as the Hamptons and Martha\u2019s Vineyard while campaign spokespeople and surrogates such as running-mate Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine pushed forward in the effort. The Clinton campaign announced Sunday that Clinton would return to the trail Tuesday with an event in Tampa and issued a statement on Trump\u2019s immigration plan, saying it\u2019s an attempt to \u201cmislead\u201d Americans. \u201cDonald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented, something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cWhat we saw today is Mike Pence and Trump\u2019s top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics.\u201d Kaine on Sunday brushed off repeated questions about the FBI investigation of Clinton's secret server, saying she requested the public release of her secretary of state emails and the release of the FBI notes from the agency\u2019s interview with her last month. The federal investigation found that some emails sent or received by Clinton included classified information. However, no criminal charges were recommended. \u201cThe reason these materials are being made public is that Hillary Clinton said I want the public to see them,\u201d Kaine told ABC. \u201cShe said it was a mistake.\u201d Kaine instead pivoted to Trump's refusal to release his tax returns -- many of which Trump says he can't release because they're under audit -- and statements from Trump that appear to show support for how Russian President Vladimir Putin runs his country. \u201cTalk about national security,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cHe has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyber hacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyberattack on the (Democratic National Committee) was likely done by Russia...This is serious business.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ed Henry reports from Lafayette Park President Obama launched into his second term with a sharply worded inaugural address Monday -- using the platform to \"reject\" steep cuts to entitlements, press for an immigration reform package and wag the finger at Washington's penchant for \"name-calling\" and \"spectacle.\" Hours later, the president took the traditional ride down Pennsylvania Avenue back to the White House. As he did four years ago, he and first lady Michelle Obama exited the limo and walked the final stretch, waving to the crowd as they went. Obama's 20-minute inaugural address, delivered to a packed crowd on the National Mall right after he took the oath of office, effectively set the tone for the next four years. After a rocky four years marked by bitter battles between the White House and Republicans in Congress, Obama made clear he would continue to press those lawmakers to move toward him on some of the toughest policy questions ahead. The president quickly toggled through a host of agenda items, but used some of his most forceful language to defend costly entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that could be the target of cuts in upcoming fiscal talks. Declaring that the country cannot succeed \"when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,\" he described those programs as a vital safety net -- though, without some intervention, budget forecasters warn they will not be sustainable in the long term. Check out FoxNews.com's full coverage of Inauguration 2013 \"We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future,\" Obama said. \"The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\" While setting his terms for looming budget fights, the president also worked in a call for immigration reform. \"Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country,\" he said. Further outlining his goals for a second term, he said the administration would \"respond to the threat of climate change.\" The president, in closing, appeared to chide the minority party, saying: \"We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.\" At the same time, he urged the country to set aside differences and work together toward addressing challenges ranging from the country's tax code to its education system. \"Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation, and one people,\" Obama said, on the west front of the Capitol. \"My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.\" Obama, over the course of the speech, appeared to offer a series of assurances to his supporters that he would continue to fight for the issues he campaigned on. However, while Obama was buoyed by his decisive win over Mitt Romney in November, he nevertheless enters the second term facing a packed agenda and a divided Congress he'll have to win over if he wants to get it passed. For the president, the second term essentially began after Election Day, when he started negotiating with congressional Republicans on the fiscal crisis. However, it took a tragic yet pivotal turn Dec. 14 when a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school. Obama, within days, vowed to find at least some measure to curb gun violence. And last week, the 44th president announced the details of his plan, which includes an assault-weapons ban, limiting magazines to 10 rounds, background checks for prospective buyers and extending mental health treatment to young Americans. His near-term legislative agenda will encompass both the gun-control issue as well as renewed talks with House Republicans over three pressing fiscal matters: the debt ceiling, massive cuts to federal spending and a budget resolution. With all of those challenges, though, Obama faces the task of bridging the divide with Congress. Partisan lines, as a result of the November elections, appeared only to harden, with Democrats locking down control of the Senate and Republicans doing likewise in the House. Washington was able to craft a last-minute deal to avert the fiscal crisis at the start of 2013, but the deal merely kicked off the big decisions -- on entitlements, on tax reform -- for another day. In the first year of Obama's second term, it should be clear whether Washington will start to make those decisions, or continue to punt. More immediately, Obama has stated that Congress must increase the debt ceiling to keep the country from defaulting on its bills and that he will not negotiate on the issue. However, the White House has already put Congress on notice that budget talks could be delayed because Obama will miss the legal Feb. 14 deadline to submit his plan. Despite having to deal with those issues right away, Obama appears committed to addressing immigration reform in the early months, purportedly in a one-step, comprehensive package. Still, the expected partisan wrangling must wait until after Monday. The inauguration ceremonies were not so cloaked in history as in 2009, when Obama became the nation's first black president before a crowd of 1.8 million. Officials expect up to 700,000 to attend Monday's ceremonies, a day-long gala throughout the District that includes the traditional inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. The president and his family started the day with services at St. John's Episcopal Church near the White House. The president and the first lady will close out the day's festivities with two official inaugural balls Monday night. Obama was sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts on two Bibles: one belonging to President Lincoln and the other from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The invocation was given by Myrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Among those performing in the roughly three-hour event were James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonc\u00e9, who sang the national anthem. The Rev. Luis Le\u00f3n delivered the benediction. In his address, the president who was the first in history to endorse gay marriage also included a reference to the cause of gay rights. \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,\" he said. Come Tuesday, the president returns to work trying to build on a first term which was largely defined by him getting Congress to pass the comprehensive health-care overhaul that he signed into law in 2010 and ending the hunt in 2011 for 9/11 terrorist Usama bin Laden. He notched other major accomplishments, some more controversial than others. He signed the law repealing the 1990s-era \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, in turn allowing for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U.S. military. He also signed into law the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid the worst recession since the Great Depression. More recently, Obama suspended deportation for younger illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents.",

            "article_content": "Refugees enter amid security debate The Obama administration hit its goal this week of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees -- yet only a fraction of a percent are Christians, stoking criticism that officials are not doing enough to address their plight in the Middle East. Of the 10,801 refugees accepted in fiscal 2016 from the war-torn country, 56 are Christians, or .5 percent. A total of 10,722 were Muslims, and 17 were Yazidis. The numbers are disproportionate to the Christian population in Syria, estimated last year by the U.S. government to make up roughly 10 percent of the population. Since the outbreak of civil war in 2011, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million Christians have fled the country, while many have been targeted and slaughtered by the Islamic State. In March, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. had determined that ISIS has committed genocide against minority religious groups, including Christians and Yazidis. \u201cIn my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims,\u201d Kerry said at the State Department, using an alternative Arabic name for the group. He also accused ISIS of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \"ethnic cleansing.\" Yet, despite the strong words, relatively few from those minority groups have been brought into the United States. A State Department spokesperson told FoxNews.com that religion was only one of many factors used in determining a refugee\u2019s eligibility to enter the United States. Critics blasted the administration for not making religion a more important factor, as the U.S. government has prioritized religious minorities in the past in other cases. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointingly disproportional,\u201d Matthew Clark, senior counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), told FoxNews.com. \u201c[The Obama administration has] not prioritized Christians and it appears they have actually deprioritized them, put them back of the line and made them an afterthought.\u201d \u201cThis is de facto discrimination and a gross injustice,\u201d said Nina Shea, director of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom. Experts say another reason for the lack of Christians in the make-up of the refugees is the make-up of the camps. Christians in the main United Nations refugee camp in Jordan are subject to persecution, they say, and so flee the camps, meaning they are not included in the refugees referred to the U.S. by the U.N. \u201cThe Christians don\u2019t reside in those camps because it is too dangerous,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThey are preyed upon by other residents from the Sunni community and there is infiltration by ISIS and criminal gangs.\u201d \u201cThey are raped, abducted into slavery and they are abducted for ransom. It is extremely dangerous, there is not a single Christian in the Jordanian camps for Syrian refugees,\u201d Shea said. However, Kristin Wright, director of advocacy for Open Doors USA \u2013 a group that advocates for Christians living in dangerous areas across the world \u2013 told FoxNews.com that another reason is many Christians are choosing to stick it out in Syria, or going instead to urban areas for now. \u201cMany have fled to urban areas instead of the camps, so they may be living in Beirut instead of living in a broader camp, meaning many are not registering as refugees,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThey may still come to the U.S. but may come through another immigration pathway.\u201d However, others called on the Obama administration, in light of its genocide declaration, to do more to assist Christians, including setting up safe zones in Syria or actively seeking out Christians via the use of contractors to bring them to safety. In March, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced legislation that would give special priority to refugees who were members of persecuted religious minorities in Syria. \u201cWe must not only recognize what's happening as genocide, but also take action to relieve it,\" Cotton said. \u201cThe administration did the right thing by recognizing genocide, but by not taking action, it deflates it and makes it so Christians and others are not receiving any help,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all words and no actions, it\u2019s just lip service on the issue of the genocide.\u201d This week, the ACLJ filed a lawsuit against the State Department for not responding to Freedom of Information Act requests about what the administration is doing to combat the genocide. For Shea, the question is not just about helping refugees, but the very survival of Christianity in the 2,000-year community that has existed since the apostolic era of Christianity. \"This Christian community is dying,\" she said. \"I fear that there will be no Christians left when the dust settles.\"",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's new campaign manager weighs in on 'Fox News Sunday' Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump announced late Sunday he'll be making a speech on illegal immigration on Wednesday in Arizona, after a week of speculation that he might be softening his promise to deport 11 million people living in the United States illegally. The announcement of the speech, posted in a Tweet, was initially set for last week in Phoenix, but was pushed back as Trump and his team wrestled over the details of what he would propose. There has been debate within his campaign about immigrants who haven't committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses. The candidate's evolving stance hasn't made it easy for top supporters and advisers, from his running mate on down, to defend him or explain some campaign positions. On Sunday, Trump\u2019s campaign and his supporters were challenged again to explain the candidate\u2019s evolving policy but appeared to find solid ground in arguing it was the opposite of Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan. \u201cThere are very few issues where they're more different,\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIn fact, Hillary Clinton is to the left of Barack Obama on immigration.\u201d Trump won the GOP primary largely by appealing to the party\u2019s conservative base with vows to deport all of the country\u2019s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants and to build a wall along the entire southern-U.S. border and have Mexico pay for the construction. However, Trump has in recent weeks appeared to search for a less austere approach, knowing that he\u2019ll need some support from Hispanic and other minority voters to win the General Election race against Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. Conway said Trump indeed wants to find \u201cthe fair and humane way\u201d to address the issue, which includes whether to separate families to enforce federal law. But she made clear that Trump still intends to build the wall and that he supports neither amnesty nor legalization for people who entered the country illegally. \u201cWe all learned in kindergarten to stand in line, to wait our turn,\u201d said Conway, who argued Trump has stopped talking about a deportation \u201cforce\u201d to remove people. \u201cGive Donald Trump credit for at least trying to address a complex issue and not pretending like Hillary Clinton does, that we don't have these problems,\u201d she said. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls shows Clinton leading Trump by 6 percentage points. Such polls also indicate Clinton is ahead in some of the most competitive and pivotal states, with 72 days remaining before Election Day. The nominees\u2019 first presidential debate is set for Sept. 26. \u201cThe real issue is look at the two plans,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\" \u201cLook at where Hillary Clinton is. She wants to put Barack Obama's immigration plan on steroids. The issue is that this is an election of choices: One, allow everyone in through complete amnesty, or number two, a tough plan that's fair and humane.\u201d The Clinton campaign argues that Trump\u2019s plan remains as \u201cdangerous\u201d as before, despite efforts to make it seem different. \u201cHe may try to disguise his plans by throwing in words like \u2018humane\u2019 or \u2018fair,' \" said campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri. \u201cBut the reality remains that Trump\u2019s agenda echoes the extreme right\u2019s will -- one that is fueling a dangerous movement of hatred across the country.\u201d GOP vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence said Sunday the main tenets of Trump's immigration plan will include building the wall, no path to legalization or citizenship and stronger border enforcement. The nominee and Indiana GOP governor also sought to distinguish Trump\u2019s position from Clinton\u2019s. \u201cIt is going to be fair. It is going to be tough,\u201d Pence told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe has said that very consistently -- the contrast with Hillary Clinton, who supports amnesty, open borders, who wants to implement executive amnesty again on Day One, even though the Supreme Court of the United States rejected it.\u201d Pence did not answer questions on whether the campaign\u2019s position, as Trump has said, is that children born to people who are in the U.S. illegally are not U.S. citizens. Native-born children of immigrants, even those living illegally in the U.S., have been automatically considered American citizens since the adoption of the 14th Amendment in 1868. Pence also could not definitively say whether Trump was sticking with his vow to remove those living in the U.S. illegally, with the help of a deportation force. \u201cWhat you heard him describe there, in his usual plainspoken, American way, was a mechanism, not a policy,\" the nominee said. Trump has focused lately on deporting people who are in the U.S. illegally and who have committed crimes. But who Trump considers a criminal also remained unclear Sunday. Pressed on the question, Priebus replied: \"I just don't speak for Donald Trump.\" FoxNews.com's Joseph Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Reaction from Ambs. Nancy Soderberg and Adam Ereli Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are scheduled Sunday to meet separately with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a critical meeting in which each is expected to seek support for their respective White House bids from a country often called the United States\u2019 most important ally. U.S. presidential candidates often visit Israel to meet with leaders. But neither Trump nor Clinton has in the 2016 election cycle. Trump, the Republican, in December 2015, postponed a trip to Israel to meet with Netanyahu after the prime minister\u2019s office criticized his proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants -- in the aftermath of several terror attacks inspired or executed by radical Islamic terrorists. Trump tweeted that he would make the trip \u201cafter I become President of the U.S.\u201d A Clinton aide on Friday confirmed with Fox News the meeting between the Democratic nominee and Netanyahu. None of politicians' aides will say when or where the meetings will take place. Netanyahu is in the United States, where he met with Obama and addressed the U.N. General Assembly this week in New York. In the 2012 presidential race, GOP nominee Mitt Romney made the trip to Israel. Trump, like Romney, has suggested that President Obama and his administration have failed to maintain strong ties with Israel, which has provided Western nations with support and stability amid decades of Middle East turmoil. The U.S. also provides billons annual to Israel in military aid. Most recently, Trump and fellow Republicans have agreed with Netanyahu that the recent, administration-brokered Iran nuclear deal hurts Israel, Tehran\u2019s enemy, because it lifts economic sanctions without sufficient safeguards to ensure Iran has indeed curbed efforts to build a nuclear weapon.

            "article_content": "Trump or Clinton administration will take office just as the latest ObamaCare enrollment tally comes in - after a year of big insurers complaining about losing money. 'The Hill's' Sarah Ferris goes 'On the Record' On the roster:\u00a0Remember ObamaCare? - Time Out: We\u2019ll see you on the radio - FBI: Foreign hackers got in state election systems - Here we go again: Clinton foundation sought access for donors - Intense scoring driveREMEMBER OBAMACARE?One of the core advantages of delaying big chunks of ObamaCare\u2019s implementation past three election cycles is that its namesake would face less of the blowback for the unpopular portions. But that also means that President Obama may have little to say about what happens to his signature initiative as it comes unwound. And unwinding seems to be exactly what is happening to the law. The brand-new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2013 among the most influential boosters for universal insurance coverage \u2013 says that the core part of the law, subsidized insurance markets on the state level, are failing. Big insurers like Aetna, UnitedHealth and Humana have fled the exchanges as promised profits failed to materialize. And because of the successful bid by congressional Republicans to block \u201crisk corridors\u201d that would have allowed the Obama administration to directly bail out big losses, there\u2019s little incentive to stick around. That means that with the law\u2019s requirements that insurers must cover those with pre-existing conditions, the companies that do remain in the exchanges find themselves with the most expensive customers to cover and far fewer of the desirable \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d the law\u2019s other key component \u2013 fines for those who refuse to enroll \u2013 have failed to deliver. The mandate that was at the heart of the legal challenges to the law and considered to be the key to the law\u2019s fiscal success appears to be failing. And since the president delayed the mandates on medium-sized businesses to provide coverage amid fears of economic slowdown, there\u2019s been no help on that side either. The result is that residents in nearly a third of the counties in America will have only one option for health insurance coverage through ObamaCare. And once these trends have strongly taken hold, reversing them seems unlikely. As the WSJ tells the story today: \u201cJoseph Devoy, a 31-year-old construction worker who lives in Arizona\u2019s Pinal County, said he had to switch insurers to UnitedHealth this year after his previous provider, the\u00a0co-op\u00a0Meritus, stopped selling plans. Now, with UnitedHealth leaving Arizona, Mr. Devoy, who has to buy coverage through the ACA marketplace to qualify for a federal subsidy, isn\u2019t sure if any insurer will be offering a plan he can buy for next year. Without one, he fears he could face a penalty under the law. \u2018I don\u2019t know what to do now,\u2019 Mr. Devoy said. Even if an insurer does come into Pinal, \u2018at that point, it\u2019s a monopoly.\u2019\u201d Obama had a solution in mind for this prospective problem even beyond the subsidies and penalties: a government run insurance provider to compete with the private sector companies. Democrats rejected the idea in the end, though, for fear of a moment just like this one in which private companies would balk and taxpayers got stuck with the sickest consumers and costs rapidly spiraled out of control. We\u2019ve long suspected that ObamaCare would not survive in its original form and we once imagined that a hefty chunk of the 2016 election would be dedicated to the fight over its replacement. Certainly no domestic issue has more consequences for more voters than the shape of health care for the next generation. And yet\u2026 It\u2019s understandable that Hillary Clinton would not be eager to tackle the subject. She is lashed to the basic concept of the law but would not like to be seen as the kind of Democrat who goes around creating brand new unfunded entitlements like another government insurance program. Does she want to go with a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan? How much will it cost? What will happen to the already ruined delivery systems if millions more non-seniors come into the system? No doubt she would rather call her rival a racist and call it a day. But as Byron York reports, neither is her rival discussing it. Donald Trump has taken sundry positions on health insurance and health care over time, but of late has limited himself to calls for the current law to be repealed and replaced. Does Trump favor universal health insurance as a right? If so, how would he deliver the coverage without breaking the bank? If not, what would he plan to do with the people like Devoy who are falling through the cracks under the current law? Trump might also rather call his rival a racist and move along himself. This is arguably no bigger issue that the next president will face than the ObamaCare implosion but the subject has gotten next to no attention amid this nastiest and most personal presidential election in modern history. There is a lot for voters to not like about 2016, but the longest-lasting regret may be not getting the next president pinned down on this and other essential subjects.TIME OUT: WE\u2019LL SEE YOU ON THE RADIO Charles Osgood announced Sunday that he is stepping down as the anchor of \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d after 26 years. Osgood\u2019s all-American, impossibly decent, respectful and smart style has earned him the adoration of millions of devoted fans. And it all started quite by accident\u2026AP: \u201cCharles Kuralt retired in 1994 after molding the position in his own easygoing image and hosting for 15 years. Mr. Osgood seemingly had an impossible act to follow. But with his folksy erudition and his slightly bookish, bow-tied style, he quickly clicked with viewers who continued to embrace the program as an unhurried TV magazine that, as before, seemed defined only by the curiosity of its host and staff. Even then, Mr. Osgood already was a CBS veteran. In 1967, he took a job as reporter on the CBS-owned New York news radio station. Then, one fateful weekend, he was summoned to fill in at the anchor desk for the TV network\u2019s Saturday newscast. In 1971, he joined the CBS network. \u2026 He once described himself as \u2018a radio guy who finally stopped being terrified of the camera.\u2019 His \u2018Sunday Morning\u2019 trademark signoff included: \u2018I\u2019ll see you on the radio.\u2019\u201d Indeed we will.

In emails dated December 2010, Clinton State Department aide Huma Abedin and then-top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band discussed potential guests for the lunch with the Chinese president -- including three executives from groups that had donated millions to the foundation, according to an ABC News report late Saturday. Among the possible guests discussed were Bob McCann, then-president of wealth management at UBS; Judith Rodin, Rockefeller Foundation president, and Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek.\u201dHillary\u2019s press conference pressure grows -WaPo: \u201c[I]t\u2019s beyond debate that Clinton has honesty and trustworthiness issues with the general public. In an\u00a0August WaPo-ABC poll, 62 percent of voters said Clinton was neither honest nor trustworthy. (That number includes 69 percent of independents who say that Clinton isn\u2019t honest or trustworthy.) Refusing to hold a news conference plays into that distrust \u2014 and might even magnify it. But put even the political calculation aside. Clinton is, without question, the favorite as of today to be elected the 45th president of the United States. Given that, she owes it to the public to demonstrate how she thinks on her feet and how she responds to unwanted or tough questions. The best \u2014 and maybe only \u2014 way to do that is via news conferences\u2026Her resistance to any real engagement with the media in the campaign sets a dangerous precedent for how accountable and transparent she might be as president.\u201d TRUMP SET TO DELIVER IMMIGRATION SPEECHFox News: \u201cRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump announced late Sunday he\u2019ll be making a speech on illegal immigration on Wednesday in Arizona, after a week of speculation that he might be softening his promise to deport 11 million people living in the United States illegally.\u00a0The announcement of the speech, posted in a Tweet, was initially set for last week in Phoenix, but was pushed back as Trump and his team wrestled over the details of what he would propose. There has been debate within his campaign about immigrants who haven't committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses...On Sunday, Trump\u2019s campaign and his supporters were challenged again to explain the candidate\u2019s evolving policy but appeared to find solid ground in arguing it was the opposite of Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan. \u2018There are very few issues where they're more different,\u2019 Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u2018In fact, Hillary Clinton is to the left of Barack Obama on immigration.\u2019\u201dPoll says voters leery of illegals, but oppose Trump wall, favor path to citizenship - The Hill: \u201cA new poll by the Pew Research Center shows that 67 percent of Americans think illegal immigrants are more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes, data that may hearten\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0given the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s tough stance on illegal immigration\u2026But while two-thirds of respondents nationwide think illegal immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes, 61 percent oppose building a wall along the U.S-Mexico border, which Trump has endorsed throughout his presidential campaign. A plurality, 45 percent, believe that creating a path for illegal immigrants to become citizens and strengthening border security, along with the enforcement of immigration laws, should be given equal priority\u2026Trump has recently opened the door to proposals that would allow illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens.\u201dTrump rolls out first big ad buy\u00a0-\u00a0AP: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign is planning its biggest ad buy to date, upward of $10 million on commercials airing over the next week or so.\u00a0The campaign expects the ads to begin airing as soon as Monday in nine states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, where the campaign has already been on the air, along with New Hampshire, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada.

            "article_content": "Adam Housley reports from California SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Despite national outrage after a Mexican man killed a woman along a waterfront pier, San Francisco officials upheld the city's strict\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0protections for people who are in the country illegally. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday for a measure that clarifies when city workers, including police officers, can notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement of a person's immigration status. Generally, the defendant must be charged with a violent crime and is someone who has been convicted of a violent crime within the past seven years. The measure, however, also grants San Francisco's sheriff leeway to contact immigration authorities in the limited cases of defendants charged with a felony if they have been convicted of other felonies in the past. The vote comes at a time of deep distrust between law enforcement and minority communities in San Francisco. Last week, the police chief was forced to resign after officers shot to death an unarmed black woman, the third such death since December. Advocates of\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0protections at the board meeting cheered the proposal's passage, even with the discretions given the sheriff. They say that a clear division between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is needed to foster trust. The\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0law dates back to 1989. The killing of Kate Steinle in July 2015 and the arrest of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez put San Francisco's leaders on the defensive as critics and outside politicians, including presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, called for a change in the city's\u00a0sanctuary\u00a0law. The sheriff at the time, Ross Mirkarimi, cited the law in defending the release of the man, a repeat drug offender and habitual border-crosser. Mirkarimi, already facing tough re-election prospects, lost to a candidate who said she would have considered greater communication between the city and federal government. That sheriff, Vicki Hennessy, fought the board's original proposal and said her office should have more discretion. As a constitutionally elected officer, she does not have to follow board orders. Supervisor John Avalos, the measure's chief sponsor, said that a judge must find that the defendant is likely guilty of a violent felony before the rule can kick in. That's a higher standard than a simple charge by the district attorney's office, he said. \"This is actually legislation that sets a clear standard for how we practice our sanctuary-city policies in San Francisco,\" Avalos said. Hennessy said she worked on a compromise because she \"felt it was better for the city to have one unified policy and still have more options for review than what we have now.\" The ordinance allows the sheriff to share release information with ICE if the person is charged with a felony and has been convicted of one serious felony or convicted of three other qualifying felonies within the previous five years. Hennessey said Tuesday that she would not have contacted ICE in the case of Lopez-Sanchez because he was not wanted on a felony. \"We reached agreement that will serve public safety, family unity and bring our community together,\" she said.",

The murder last week of Brentwood High School students, Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 15, and the discovery of two sets of human remains, males ages 17 and 19, in a wooded area adjacent to the Long Island Railroad have allegedly been linked to the MS-13 gang that has wreaked havoc in Brentwood. Mickens' family said they believe gang members tried to kidnap Cuevas, and investigators say Mickens may have been killed trying to help her friend. Nisa Mickens, (l.), and Kayla Cuevas, (r.) Suffolk County police said on Friday that the department was launching an \"all-out assault\" on gangs in the 11-square-mile town as well as in Central Islip and Wyandanch. Area residents are worried and frightened given the notorious El Salvadorean gang's growth in the area, which they say has coincided with an influx of illegal immigrants. \u201cWithout a doubt the community is scared, but I know of instances where residents have heard things and have called police,\u201d says Ray Mayo, executive director, Brentwood\u00a0Association for Concerned Citizens. Mayo said that while he has seen a direct correlation between the infusion of Central American teens in the community and the increase in gang activity, the community is not putting up with it. \u201cWe have been in regular talks with the police to come up with some strategies,\u201d says Mayo. He said residents are supportive of immigrants, even undocumented, who have come to Brentwood to better their lives and who are law abiding, paying their taxes, and striving towards citizenship. It is the other, growing and nefarious immigrant element that concerns Mayo. Law enforcement officials say MS-13 is the largest gang on Long Island with Suffolk County \u201ccliques\u201d concentrated in the villages of Brentwood, Huntington, Copiague, Farmingdale, and Islip. Suffolk County Legislator for Brentwood, Monica Martinez, a former teacher and school district administrator, says she has seen a transformation in recent years of this predominantly African-American and Hispanic working class community 47 miles east of New York City. \u201cWe have seen an influx of them to the district, one in which no child was denied access to an education,\u201d Martinez says. \u201cThere is no indication that the current incidents have been a result of the influx of unaccompanied children.\u201d Martinez said these types of incidents have occurred in waves. \u201cWe had a surge in 2012-2013 and unfortunately we are seeing it again,\u201d she says. \u201cActually after researching a bit myself the sharpest increase in violent crime was in 2010,\u201d Between October 2013 and July 2016 nearly 3,500 unaccompanied children from Central America were placed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Suffolk County, one of the highest placement areas in the country. The overwhelming majority are law-abiding and welcome, say residents. But some come with gang experience and others are ripe for recruitment, according to law enforcement sources. Even before 2013, Brentwood was a hotbed for gang violence with skirmishes between MS-13, the Latin Kings and Bloods.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, the Salvadoran gang claimed a violent stranglehold on the community. Some of the more heinous acts of violence Brentwood experienced began in 2008, when members of MS-13 were involved in a non-fatal shooting incident in a Brentwood park. In 2009, several MS-13 gang members attacked suspected rival gang members at a house party killing one. This was followed in 2010 when the violence spun out of control. MS-13 gang members, committed two murders and one attempted murder in February and March 2010. One member was convicted in connection with the murder of 21-year-old David Sandler and the attempted murder of 20-year-old Aaron Galan in Brentwood. One of the prime suspects convicted in many of these violent crimes was already an MS-13 member in El Salvador when he entered the U.S. illegally. Also in 2010, the Sailors clique of the MS-13 suspected that fellow member Rigoberto Gomez was cooperating with local law enforcement. As a result, the Sailors put a \u201cgreen light\u201d on Gomez, authorizing other MS-13 members to kill Gomez on sight. In the early morning hours of Aug. 31, 2010, Hector Torres, then second in command of the BLS clique, together with a Sailors clique member, who has also been charged federally, spotted Gomez as they drove through Brentwood. They lured Gomez into the car, inviting him to smoke marijuana with them at a nearby park. Gomez was shot three times in the head and killed. Most recently, before the Mickens and Cuevas killings, three teen age gang members were charged with the brutal gang rape of a 16-year-old girl by the Brentwood Country Club in 2015. The discovery of four dead teenagers in one week, possibly at the hands of MS-13, has sparked outrage. Lenny Tucker, president, Brentwood Association for Concerned Citizens, said the community was taken by surprise with the influx of Central American teens and is outraged at the impact the violence the gang has had on their community as well as the lack of attention paid by the federal government. \u201cAfter all of the community\u2019s hard work to keep our children safe, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the federal government has done its due diligence or us any justice.\u201d Tucker says the children coming into Brentwood have been exposed to violence in their countries and have a mindset of lack of control to violent behavior. Mickens was buried Wednesday and Cuevas on Friday.",

            "article_content": "Haunting images of young boy rescued after air strike hit family's home in Aleppo, Syrian civil war all he's known As President Obama enters his final five months in office \u2013 five years after demanding Bashar Assad \u201cstep aside\u201d \u2013 the U.S. is faced with the likelihood that Obama will be gone long before the Syrian strongman. Syria\u2019s ruthless leader is now only more entrenched in Damascus \u2013 atop a crumbling nation whose civil war has killed hundreds of thousands, produced millions of refugees and entangled the U.S. and its allies in a convoluted warzone alongside regional powers all with different aims. No matter who wins the 2016 election, the worsening stalemate leaves a Middle East mess for the next president. \u201cThe United States can't fix Syria. It never could, it never did, and what Syria will go down as is the poster child of President Obama having policies in his head that work fine, but on the ground, make no sense whatsoever,\u201d the Heritage Foundation\u2019s James Carafano said. The human toll of the war -- and the impact of the refugees who have overwhelmed neighboring countries, changed the face of Europe and now pose thorny security questions for U.S. immigration policy -- cannot be overstated. The world was reminded of this once again this week, when an opposition group released chilling footage of a child rescued from the rubble of an Aleppo airstrike. The boy can be seen, dazed and bloodied and covered in dust, staring vacantly from an orange chair. It was the latest example of how the rhetoric of 2011 and the reality of the present are at sharp odds. On Aug. 18, 2011, Obama made his first formal call for Assad to go. \u201cWe have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way.\u00a0He has not led,\u201d Obama said. \u201cFor the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.\u201d The death toll since 2011 now is estimated to be as high as a half-million, as Assad continues to repel rebel advances. According to the Associated Press, government forces blunted a new rebel assault near Aleppo on Monday, forcing them to retreat from areas they had just seized. Meanwhile, the migration crisis has swelled to astonishing levels. According to the United Nations, nearly 5 million refugees have registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The U.N. also reports more than 1 million Syrians have entered asylum applications in Europe. The Obama administration is also trying to vet and process thousands of Syrian refugees, fueling security concerns about whether the U.S. can adequately screen for terror ties. On Thursday, discussing the five-year mark, State Department spokesman John Kirby defended the progress made to date, noting that in the same 2011 speech Obama also noted the U.S. would not impose a transition but would pressure Assad to leave while supporting the rights of the Syrian people. \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve done since then has supported that overarching goal,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWhat the president said five years ago, you have to take that in totality and all its context.\u201d Part of the administration\u2019s challenge in pursuing Assad\u2019s ouster all along has been finding credible opposition groups to support \u2013 the group pushed back near Aleppo earlier this week, for instance, reportedly includes Fath al-Sham, which previously was the Al Qaeda affiliate in the country under a different name. The administration also has been accused of dragging its feet in providing support to moderate opposition it could identify, and faulted for not backing up its \u201cred line\u201d threat when Assad was accused of using chemical weapons. \u201cDictators look for clues from world leaders \u2026 around what they\u2019ll do to stop or not stop them,\u201d Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent now mounting an independent bid for president, told Fox News. \u201cFor [Assad] to see that President Obama didn\u2019t back up that line gave him the green light to continue attacks on Syrian civilians.\u201d Meanwhile, the U.S. and its allies \u2013 and its adversaries \u2013 are actively fighting the Islamic State, not Assad. While the defeat of the deadly terror network is a near-universal goal among nations, that military campaign has helped diminish yet another one of Assad\u2019s foes inside Syria, even as ISIS expands its global influence via affiliates and poses a rising threat to the West with its attempt to inspire lone-wolf attackers. Further, while actors like Russia are helping fight ISIS, they are openly supporting Assad\u2019s claim to power. A top Chinese military officer also visited Syria this week to show support for the Syrian president\u2019s regime, according to an AP report. It is unclear whether the U.S. will stick with a policy of seeking Assad\u2019s ouster. Obama in November reiterated that Assad must go, arguing that fighting in the country will rage on as long as he\u2019s in power. But other influential voices have questioned this view. According to a McClatchy report in May, Clinton adviser and former White House official Phil Gordon wants the U.S. to shelve its demand for regime change as a condition for peace talks. Obama\u2019s former Defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, also said in January that the administration has been \u201cparalyzed\u201d by its Assad-must-go demand. Bloomberg reported in December that there is disagreement within the administration on whether regime change is necessary to end the civil war. Meanwhile, the administration continues to blow by targets and deadlines and red lines in the struggling quest for peace. The U.S. and Russia reportedly plan to convene for another meeting on Syria\u2019s civil war on Aug. 26, in an attempt to forge a cease-fire. But the AP reported that the U.S. issued no change in policy even as a target for political transition passed on Aug. 1. Secretary of State John Kerry originally warned in May of \u201crepercussions\u201d without progress on a transition by that date. Earlier this month, Kerry said the U.S. would keep trying to bring all sides together in political talks. He told reporters that it\u2019s critical for Russia to \u201crestrain\u201d itself and the Assad regime from further \u201coffensive operations,\u201d and it is the U.S. responsibility to get opposition forces to do the same. \u201cNow, my hope is that we can arrive at that. If we can\u2019t, nobody\u2019s going to sit around and allow this pretense to continue,\u201d Kerry said, without specifying what the consequences for the stalemate might be.",

Rudy will be the chairman \u2026 He should be able to come back quickly [with findings],\u201d Trump told Fox News. After the presumptive Republican presidential nominee earlier this week first floated the idea of naming the Giuliani to lead the group, he told Fox News on Friday that he\u2019s since spoken with Giuliani about the job. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at the problem. We\u2019re going to study the problem -- it\u2019s a temporary ban,\u201d Trump said. And he said the group would look at the U.S.-Mexico border, which he said is like \"Swiss cheese.\" While offering more details about the commission, Trump also helped settle some confusion about whether the \u201ctemporary ban\u201d \u2013 arguably the candidate\u2019s most controversial proposal of his entire campaign \u2013 is still being considered. Trump said earlier this week it\u2019s only a \u201csuggestion.\u201d Trump also had told Fox News earlier this week, before a high-profile set of meetings with GOP leaders in Washington, that he would like to \u201cback off as soon as possible\u201d on the ban. He made clear on Friday that he still wants to study the idea, but continued to say it\u2019s just a \u201csuggestion,\u201d as many of his campaign proposals are. \u201cAnything I say right now -- I\u2019m not the president, everything\u2019s a suggestion,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI feel strongly we have to do something.\u201d Meanwhile, the plan continues to fuel likely general election rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s stump speech warnings about Trump. Earlier this week, Clinton cited the plan in calling Trump a \u201cloose cannon\u201d and decried what she described as his \u201chate rhetoric.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NORFOLK, Va. \u2013 Khizr Khan, a Muslim-American whose son was killed in Iraq, held back tears Wednesday as he again took on Donald Trump, saying the Republican presidential nominee is peddling hate and no less than the \"future of the earth\" is at stake in the Nov. 8 election. \"There comes a time in an ordinary citizen's life where you have to gather all the courage you have and you stand up and speak against tyranny and speak against un-American hate,\" Khan said in a reference to Trump's stance on immigration, which has ranged from a complete ban on foreign Muslim immigrants entering the United States to \"extreme\" vetting and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from countries and regions plagued by extremism. \"This hate,\" Khan said at the Masjid William Salaam mosque, \"is un-American.\" Trump fired back with a familiar refrain, telling ABC News that Khan's son, who died in Iraq trying to protect his unit from a suicide bomber, would still be alive had Trump been president in 2004 instead of Republican George W. Bush. \"I wouldn't have been in Iraq,\" Trump said, once again falsely insisting he was opposed to the Iraq War before it started. \"Had I been president, Capt. Khan would be alive today.\" Fumed Khan, \"This is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents.\" Khan first gained national attention from the podium of the Democratic National Convention when he paid homage to his son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in Iraq in 2004. Khan held up his pocket-sized Constitution and said Trump has sacrificed \"nothing.\" The elder Khan's Norfolk visit comes after a new Hillary Clinton campaign ad that features him tearfully discussing his son's death. The campaign said last week that it would air the ad in seven battleground states. Trump won most of the southeastern cities and counties along the James River in Virginia's March 1 Republican primary. And a survey of the nation's service members conducted last month by the Military Times and Syracuse University showed Trump slightly leading Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, 37.6 percent to 36.5 percent. Clinton had 16.3 percent of their support. Trina Phillips, chair of Military Spouses for Trump, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that her candidate has widespread support. \"I think the Khans have come out and used their Muslim background as a weapon to make him seem more prejudiced against them,\" said Phillips, 46, who lives in nearby Newport News with her husband, an air traffic controller in the Air Force. \"They're also using the death of their child as a weapon,\" she said. \"And that's not very fair.\" But Khayriyyah Azeez, 63, a retired nurse from Norfolk, said she sees support for Clinton. Her son, Kasib Azeez, is a Navy sailor who prayed with Khan at the mosque after Wednesday's speech. \"It's easy to fall for some of the stuff Trump says,\" Azeez said. \"But when I speak to my son, most of the young people (in the military) are voting for Hillary.\" Speaking to the AP after his speech, Khan said the mosque was an appropriate place to stump for Clinton. \"Somehow it has gotten into our minds that places of worship should not be included in your political conversation. Not at all,\" he said. \"This election is a crossroad election for the future of this country.\"",

            "article_content": "Law allows police to question status of possible illegal immigrants A pair of veteran immigration judges have left a widely read legal journal over its ban on the term \"illegal alien,\" calling the decision a case of the \"political correctness word police\" taking control of the immigration debate. Retired U.S. Immigration Court judges Mahlon \"Mick\" Hanson and Elizabeth Hacker, who wrote opinion articles for Law360's \"expert analysis\" section since the beginning of this year, say they used the term \"illegal alien\" without issue. But when they submitted an article in July on sanctuary cities, the editors of the publication declined to publish it unless certain changes were made,\u00a0including the removal of the term illegal alien. \"Language must conform to Law360 style, avoiding what is perceived to be derogatory reference to 'illegal aliens,'\" Christian Lewis, assistant managing editor of Law360, wrote in a July 30 email to Dale Wilcox of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, who was submitting the piece on behalf of the judges because they are IRLI board members. \"The only legally correct term is 'illegal alien.'\" \"I understand based on the authors' June 10 article that they believe this is a semantic argument, however our publication does follow the rule that 'illegal' applies to actions, not individuals,\" Lewis wrote. Law360 -- a subscription, legal news source which boasts a readership of 400,000 and is operated by the Portfolio Media company, a subsidiary of LexisNexis --\u00a0first suggested the judges change the language to \"undocumented alien\" and then \"unauthorized alien.\" In addition, Lewis questioned the sources used by the seasoned immigration jurists in writing their piece, which roundly criticized sanctuary cities following the July 1 murder of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle. Francisco Sanchez, an illegal alien, is accused of killing Steinle, who was shot while walking with her father in San Francisco. Sanctuary cities are communities that have an official policy of not cooperating with federal authorities in the detention of illegal immigrants or handing them over for deportation. Critics of the term say the word \"illegal\" should be used to describe actions, but not people. The judges said they were \"shocked\" by the editorial board's insistence the term not be used -- noting the Immigration & Nationality Act and its various amendments use \"illegal alien,\" as do judges presiding over immigration law cases nationwide. A LexisNexis search of the term's use in case law generates thousands of examples. Hanson and Hacker said they trimmed their article at the editors' request and clarified their sources, but refused to resubmit the piece with language they deemed legally incorrect. \"I was, quite frankly, very surprised,\" Hacker told FoxNews.com. \"We had submitted several other articles to them on immigration-related issues and had used that term, which we consider to be the legally correct term.\" \"I don't want to use inappropriate language, which in my opinion is designed to deceive people as to the state of affairs in the immigration area,\" Hacker said. \"The only legally correct term is 'illegal alien,'\" added Hanson. Hacker, (r.), was appointed a US Immigration judge in 1995, and believes the  term \"illegal alien\" is accurate and inoffensive. In an email to FoxNews.com, Law360 explained that it is simply complying with The Associated Press guidelines for journalists. In 2013, the AP dropped the use of the word \"illegal\" to describe a person who enters or resides in a country in violation of civil or criminal law. \"Like many other news organizations, Law360 follows Associated Press style on the use of the term \"illegal immigrant,\" Cat Fredenburgh, editor-in-chief of Law360, said in the email. \"Per AP, Law360 uses the term 'illegal' to refer only to actions, not people. Law360 requires all third-party contributors to comply with our style guidelines. \"Hon. Elizabeth Hacker and Hon. Mahlon Hanson submitted an article for publication with Law360 but withdrew the article upon learning of Law360's policy against the use of the term 'illegal' to refer to people,\" Fredenburgh said. \"We did not ban the judges from writing for Law360. In fact, we suggested ways the article could still be published while complying with our style. The judges' decision to withdraw the article from consideration with Law360 was theirs alone.\" The editorial board's style change -- and the reason for it -- did nothing to persuade the judges to resubmit their piece. \"I think it's basically a propaganda tool when The Associated Press is starting to tell reporters what term to use,\" Hanson said. \"It's really disappointing because they advertise themselves as a trusted legal resource,\" he said of the law publication. \"You know how definitions are important in court cases in using the precise legal terminology...I was surprised that they pushed it to that extent.\" In an Op-Ed published Thursday for FoxNews.com, Hacker and Hanson blamed the Obama administration and other factors for changing the terms of the illegal immigration debate to push an agenda. \"This administration, a compliant media and the 'political correctness' word police have taken control of the immigration debate with an agenda of deception, doublespeak and censorship.\" Of the term \"undocumented immigrant,\" Hacker and Hanson said it is \"factually incorrect because many of the aliens illegally present in this country have documents.\" \"These documents may range from those unlawfully obtained, like Social Security cards or Social Security numbers, fraudulent drivers licenses, or other documents legally obtained such as 'cedulas' or driver\u2019s licenses,\" they said. \"Also, the term 'immigrant' only applies to a person who has either legally entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident or has been adjusted to that status while in the United States.\" Click here to read the judges' Op-Ed.",

            "article_content": "Woman blamed for hindering arrest of suspect in San Bernardino attack A U.S. immigration official accused in a federal report of hindering law enforcement agents seeking a suspect in the San Bernardino terror attack and then lying about it has been nominated for a prestigious award \u2013 for telling her employees to stay calm and fetching one who was eating lunch in his car. FoxNews.com reported in June that Irene Martin, who heads the San Bernardino U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office, had been nominated for the Department of Homeland Security \u201cAward for Valor.\u201d But the department refused to say what Martin had done to earn consideration for an award previously given to government employees who saved people from sinking ships and burning cars and confronted gun-wielding criminals. The answer was only revealed through a Freedom of Information Act request. As the Dec. 2, 2015, attack unfolded a mile and a half away, Martin \u201cwarned [her] employees to be very careful and to be vigil (sic) about their surroundings,\u201d according to the nominating petition. Irene Martin, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services field boss who clashed with federal law enforcement agents, is shown here in file photo greeting Spc. Brent Kiley, of the US Army\u2019s 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. (Sgt. Giancarlo Casem/Defense Video & Imagery Distribution System) When Martin learned that one member of her staff was sitting in his car after returning from lunch, a security guard refused to go and get him, saying the office was under lockdown. \u201c[Director] Martin took it upon herself to walk out to the parking lot, locate the employee and escort him back inside where he would be safer,\u201d the petition stated, adding that she also soothed members of the public who were temporarily stranded in the building. \u201cMartin\u2019s actions on that terrible day demonstrated not only her professionalism and exceptional leadership, but also her compassion and caring for her employees and the public we serve,\u201d read the nomination. A section on the nominating form for listing \u201cSpecial Honors and Awards for the past 5 years\u201d was left blank. \u201cBasically, Ms. Martin followed standard operating procedures for an emergency situation in the area by addressing the staff, suspending programs and sending everyone home early \u2013 it\u2019s what thousands of supervisors around San Bernardino must have been doing that day,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based research institute. The nomination was made by Martin\u2019s supervisors in Washington on March 3, just over a week before the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth launched his investigation into Martin\u2019s behavior the day after the attack. Roth\u2019s probe found that Martin blocked five armed Department of Homeland Security agents seeking the man authorities now say supplied the firepower in the deadly attack. The report also said she lied to investigators about her actions. Vaughan said she suspects the award nomination was put forward to give cover to Martin, who may have broken the law. \u201cIt certainly appears that the agency is trying to distract from that misconduct by puffing up this incident into an award nomination,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cThe agency leaders appear to believe that egregious poor judgment and a serious act of obstruction can be canceled out by another good deed. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d The DHS award is described as \u201cthe highest departmental recognition for extraordinary acts of valor by an employee or group, occurring while on or off duty\u201d and is reserved for \u201cthose who have demonstrated extraordinary courage in a highly dangerous, life-threatening situation or emergency under extreme stress and involving a specific act of valor, such as saving another person\u2019s life or property.\u201d Martin\u2019s initial actions occurred as Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook killed 14 and wounded 22 at the Inland Regional Center, a social services facility where Farook\u2019s county co-workers were having a Christmas party. Authorities believe Enrique Marquez, who had an appointment with Martin's staff the next day when the authorities showed up, gave the jihadist couple the guns used in the attack. Martin\u2019s role in the next day\u2019s turf war was exposed by unidentified whistle-blowers who went to Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who then requested the Inspector General\u2019s investigation. Roth\u2019s report found Martin improperly hindered the work of five armed agents on site just 24 hours after the attack. It noted DHS agents were sent to the USCIS building to arrest Marquez, who authorities were frantically trying to track down. Marquez, it turned out, had not shown up for his scheduled appointment at the USCIS building, but Martin kept agents waiting 30 minutes before meeting with them, and another hour before she turned over the USCIS file on Marquez. Marquez was eventually arrested and is being held on charges related to supplying the guns as well as marriage fraud. Martin also lied to the Inspector General\u2019s investigators, according to the June 6 report, about her role in what has been characterized as a turf battle. Lying to federal investigators is a felony and can result in dismissal and criminal charges. \u201cWe concluded that the USCIS Field Office Director at the San Bernardino office improperly delayed \u2026 agents from conducting a lawful and routine law enforcement action,\u201d the report stated. \u201cWe have also concluded that the Field Office Director was not candid with OIG investigators during her interview.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Reaction from the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics In the cornucopia of pro-Clinton polling that preceded the 2016 presidential election, two polls stood out as outliers: the USC/LA Times tracking poll and the Investor's Business Daily/TIPP tracking poll. Both polls attempted to measure the national popular vote, but wound up capturing the scale of Donald Trump's victory in the Electoral College. \"As far as I was concerned, I was anticipating a Trump win,\" said\u00a0Raghavan Mayur, President of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts the IBD/TIPP poll. The final poll, released on Election Day, showed Trump with a two-percentage point lead over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Mayur compared Tuesday's election to 2004, when enthusiasm among Republicans helped George W. Bush get re-elected president despite exit polls favoring then-Sen. John Kerry. He also saw \"very robust enthusiasm\" for Trump among independents, which canceled out the registration advantage held by Democrats. \"Since Sept. 1, the number of Republicans [in the poll sample] was much higher than the number of Democrats,\" Mayur said. \"It was a new phenomenon in the data [and] I was not sure what is happening here.\" \"Day after day, I was weighing down Republicans until the final four or five days [of the race],\" Mayur continued. \"What I am seeing is ... a good amount of enthusiasm ... so I was going to predict who would show up.\" \"Polling is as much an art as science,\" said IBD Commentary Editor Terry Jones. \"It requires judgement ... [Mayur] sort of sensed this move and our polling responded to great enthusiasm. \"If you turn [voters] out, you'll get them enthused, and last night we saw that.\" The USC/LA Times tracking poll, notable for interviewing the same 3,200 respondents over a period of several months, gave Trump a 3.2-percentage point lead the day before the election. Since it premiered in early July, the poll results were about six percentage points more favorable to the real estate mogul than the national average. \"To be honest, I was surprised,\" University of Southern California economist Arie Kapteyn, who developed the poll, told the Los Angeles Times. \"I thought Clinton would win. But that shouldn\u2019t change the numbers.\" The poll surveyed voters on their likelihood, on a scale of 0-100, of supporting a certain candidate, as well as their likelihood of actually going to the polls. That helped Kapteyn and colleague Jill Darling detect white voters who sat out the 2012 election, but broke for Trump on Election Day. The pollsters' decision to weigh the sample based on voters' self-reported 2012 choices raised eyebrows and skewed the results toward Trump, according to former U.S. Treasury economist Ernie Tedeschi. The problem, according to Tedeschi, is that many people will incorrectly claim to have voted for Obama in 2012, when they actually voted for Romney or another candidate. On Election Day, Tedeschi ran his own version of the poll that gave more weight to census factors, such as marital status. The result showed Clinton leading the popular vote by just under 2 points, closer to the likely final outcome of the election. REVISED: Census-reweighted LAT/USC, Nov 8: Clinton +1.9https://t.co/NgjGMaBkfU pic.twitter.com/wXLxK3XZU4 \"It was an exercise to try to figure out what made the poll an outlier,\" Tedeschi said. \"I actually like the poll [method] a lot. \"If they had looked around and thought 'Boy, we're really out of line' and changed it,\" he added. \"That is in and of itself a form of bias.\"",

            "article_content": "'Fox News Sunday' exclusive interview with Donald Trump's campaign manager Top Donald Trump aide Corey Lewandowski on Sunday defended Trump\u2019s recent criticism of New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a fellow Republican, and deflected a host of other complaints about Trump's presidential campaign, saying the real issues are jobs and the economy. \u201cThe governor is not doing the job,\u201d Lewandowski said about Martinez on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d in a sharp exchange with host Chris Wallace. \u201cLet\u2019s get it right. \u2026 This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democratic issue. We stand by our statement.\u201d Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, is being chastised by party leaders and others for attacking a Latino Republican governor, in her home state, particularly when Republicans sorely need the minority and female vote to win the general election. \"Your governor has got to do a better job,\" Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Albuquerque, hitting Martinez on high state unemployment and other issues. \"She's not doing the job. Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico. I'll get this place going.\" The remarks quelled speculation that Trump might pick Martinez, also chairman of the Republican Governors Association, as his running mate and brought to her defense such GOP leaders as House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Martinez endorsed for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Martinez's office responded by telling reporters in a statement: \"Apparently, Donald Trump doesn't realize Governor Martinez wasn't elected in 2000, that she has fought for welfare reform, and has strongly opposed the president's Syrian refugee plan.\" Lewandowski on Sunday argued the real issues are jobs, the economy and immigration. \u201cWe need to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to put people back to work, cut taxes. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d Lewandowski also argued his purported disputes with fellow top campaign adviser Paul Manafort are media hype, saying they speak several times daily and work together on key decisions. He also defended Trump\u2019s decision not to debate Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, suggesting the billionaire businessman was joking when he brought up the idea. Lewandowski said the campaign is \u201csolely focused\u201d on beating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to waste our time debating Bernie Sanders when he\u2019s not going to be the nominee,\u201d he said. Sanders said Friday night on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d that he would still \u201clove\u201d to debate Trump and essentially asked him to reconsider. \u201cTrump claims to be a real tough guy, pushes people around. Hey Donald, come on up and let's debate about the future of America,\" Sanders said. Lewandowski also defended against criticism that the campaign staff is too small to win a general election against one as deep and far-reaching as Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been leaner with better results,\u201d said Lewandowski, arguing the campaign won\u2019t have 700 or 800 people, like Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe spent less money, got better results.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Campaign surrogate and former congressman Pete Hoekstra explains why on 'America's Newsroom' Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in what was billed as a major foreign policy address, on Monday backed off past threats to withdraw from the NATO alliance -- saying that if he's elected, the U.S. will work with the 28-member bloc to defeat the Islamic State. During his speech in Youngstown, Ohio, Trump called for working \"very closely with NATO,\" describing radical Islamic terrorism as the dominant global threat and one that must be confronted at all levels. In doing so, Trump acknowledged having previously described NATO as \"obsolete\" for not dealing adequately with terrorism. \"Since my comments, they have changed their policy,\" Trump said, calling this apparent development \"very, very good.\" Trump's latest NATO comments indeed mark a turnaround from warnings that if he's president, the U.S. might not come to the aid of alliance members if they are attacked by Russia or another country. Those remarks, made earlier this summer, drew heavy criticism from not only from Democrats and Republicans but also from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \u201cI will not interfere with the U.S. election campaign, but what I can do is say what matters for NATO. Solidarity among allies is a key value for NATO,\u201d Stoltenberg said. Part of the NATO treaty established in 1949 requires that if one member nation is attacked, all the other nations must come to that country\u2019s defense. Trump also on Monday called for an American policy shift, vowing to focus resources on stopping the spread of radical Islam. \u201cIf I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end,\u201d Trump said. The Republican presidential nominee noted he opposed the Iraq war more than a decade ago, while blaming what he called the \"disastrous\" decisions of President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his 2016 rival, for the spread of radical Islamic terror. \u201cWe cannot let this evil continue,\u201d Trump said of the radical Islam threat. During his speech Trump proposed \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and visitors to the United States, vowing once more to block those who sympathize with extremist groups or don't embrace American values. He said the policy would first require a temporary halt in immigration from dangerous regions of the world. \"We can never choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies,\u201d Trump said. Ahead of Trump's address, Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden vigorously challenged the Republican nominee's preparedness to be commander in chief. Biden called Trump's views \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and warned that Trump's false assertions last week about President Obama founding the Islamic State could be used by extremists to target American service members in Iraq. \"The threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks,\" he said. While Trump has been harshly critical of Obama's handling of the threat posed by the Islamic State, his own policies for defeating the group remain vague. His most specific prescriptions Monday centered on changing U.S. immigration policy to keep potential attackers from entering the country. Trump's campaign aides said a new ideological test for admission to the United States would vet applicants for their stance on issues like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights. The government would use questionnaires, social media, interviews with friends and family or other means to determine if applicants support American values like tolerance and pluralism. The U.S. would stop issuing visas in any case where it cannot perform adequate screenings. Trump did not clarify how U.S. officials would assess the veracity of responses to the questionnaires or how much manpower it would require to complete such arduous vetting. Nor did the campaign say whether additional screenings would apply to the millions of tourists who spend billions of dollars visiting the United States each year. Trump also slammed Clinton, saying she lacks the \"mental and physical stamina\" to take on ISIS. He said destroying the terror group would be the centerpiece of his foreign policy and he would partner with any countries that share that goal -- specifically singling out Russia as a nation the U.S. could have a better relationship with. The Republican nominee's foreign policy address comes during a rocky stretch for his campaign. He's struggled to stay on message and has consistently overshadowed his policy rollouts, including an economic speech last week, with provocative statements, including his comments falsely declaring that Obama was the \"founder\" of the Islamic State. Trump spent much of the speech building a case that Obama and Clinton are to blame for the creation of the terror group that has roiled the Middle East and carried out attacks in the West. He specifically highlighted the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011, arguing the move created a vacuum for terror groups to thrive. Reiterating a favorite criticism of Republicans, Trump also panned the Obama administration for not using the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\" to describe sympathizers. Obama, Clinton and top U.S. officials have warned against using that kind of language to describe the conflict, arguing that it plays into militants' hands. Trump's immigration proposals were the latest version of a policy that began with his unprecedented call to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from entering the country -- a religious test that was criticized across party lines as un-American. Following a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June, Trump introduced a new standard, vowing to \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\" That proposal raised numerous questions that the campaign never clarified, including whether it would apply to citizens of countries like France, Israel, or Ireland, which have suffered recent and past attacks. Trump had promised to release his list of \"terror countries\" soon. But aides say the campaign needs access to unreleased Department of Homeland Security data to assess exactly where the most serious threats lie. Clinton pre-empted Trump\u2019s speech at a rally earlier Monday with Vice President Biden in Scranton, Pa., where she claimed Trump often \u201chas no plan\u201d when it comes to foreign affairs. She also criticized him, before he softened his rhetoric on NATO, for past comments questioning America\u2019s NATO commitments, accusing him of discussing \u201cwalking away from our European allies.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "FILE - In this Dec. 18, 2013, file photo, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks at a news conference at the Sheriff's headquarters in Phoenix, Ariz. (AP) PHOENIX \u2013 The sheriff for metropolitan Phoenix trounced three rivals Tuesday to win his Republican primary in what could be the toughest campaign in his 24 years in office as he faces a storm of legal troubles stemming from his immigration patrols. Sheriff Joe Arpaio easily beat former Buckeye Police Chief Dan Saban and two lesser-known Republicans. Arpaio has raised a staggering amount of money for a local sheriff's race \u2014 $11.3 million and counting, most from people living in other states. The 84-year-old lawman moves on to face the race's sole Democrat, retired Phoenix police Officer Paul Penzone, in the Nov. 8 general election. Penzone lost the 2012 sheriff's race by six percentage points, marking his second closest election in Arpaio's political career. Arpaio is seeking a seventh term as he experiences the worst legal troubles in his career. Over the past four years, a federal judge has ruled that Arpaio's officers racially profiled Latinos during traffic stop, and the sheriff was found in civil contempt of court for defying court orders in the case. The judge recently recommended that Arpaio face criminal prosecution over the contempt case for prolonging his immigration patrols months after the court ordered them stopped. He could be sent to jail if he is found in violation of criminal contempt-of-court charges. Arpaio rose to national political prominence by cracking down on illegal immigration and by jailing inmates in tents in triple-degree temperatures and dressing them in pink underwear. The sheriff has been criticized for saddling taxpayers with huge legal bills by creating contentious immigration and jail policies that were later challenged in court. The taxpayer costs from the racial-profiling case alone are projected to reach $54 million by next summer. In recent years, Republican presidential candidates have sought Arpaio's endorsement. He has thrown his support this year behind Donald Trump and stumped for the GOP nominee during his visits to Arizona, including a huge gathering in March in the affluent Phoenix suburb where the sheriff lives. He also gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he said Trump would prevent immigrants from sneaking into the country. He is scheduled to speak before Trump on Wednesday as he delivers a much-anticipated immigration speech in Phoenix. Arpaio has seen his popularity wane over the past four elections. The 2012 race marked his second-closest election as sheriff; he defeated Penzone by 6 percentage points. Still, the $11.3 million in campaign money Arpaio has raised far exceeds his opponents' fundraising. Saban raised $30,000, while retired sheriff's deputy Wayne Baker brought in $40,000 and former sheriff's posse volunteer Marsha Hill reported $15,000. Arpaio's challengers have promised to bring more professionalism and less self-promotion to the job. Arpaio's critics say he wastes taxpayer money by pursuing flimsy cases that get him publicity but ultimately get thrown out and result in costly lawsuits.",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) Donald Trump has surged in national polls but his prospects for winning the presidency remain dim. His weakness among suburban voters, especially women, leaves him trailing by about 7 points in Pennsylvania, and it is tough to construct a plausible scenario giving him the 270 electoral votes needed to win without the Keystone State. Similarly, his strength with blue collar men is likely not be enough to overcome his weakness among more-educated, middle class women in several other battleground states\u2014even if not by such a wide margin. New revelations about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and her obsession with secrecy, laid bare by her bout with pneumonia, gave Trump an opening to reintroduce himself as a more reasonable choice to those women. Instead, he resurrected the birther issue and pounded on the evils of immigration and free trade, and poor Mexico. Middle class women work outside the home, and often employ or work alongside immigrants. They shop at Walmart, are skeptical about balancing family budgets without inexpensive goods from China, and many recognize the United States can\u2019t simply rip up NAFTA without wholly destabilizing Mexico and causing millions more to try to cross our southern border. A more reasoned approach to immigration\u2014one giving priority to applicants with skills in short supply and committed to assimilating\u2014would benefit our economy but he still talks about building a wall and getting tough to make our country safe. It reminds me of a mother\u2019s admonition, \u201cIf you yell, no matter what you say, people remember you as a screamer and not your message.\u201d On trade, Trump has failed to effectively state the obvious. We want to trade with Mexico, China and others and benefit from what they do best, but we don\u2019t want the game rigged by foreign government subsidies and other gimmicks so that we can\u2019t make and sell what we do best. It\u2019s all about giving everyone a chance to prosper\u2014including the most ordinary Americans. His advisors indicate that is where he would take U.S. trade policy, but when he threatens to rip up NAFTA and slap a big tariff on China\u2014without explaining how he would use those to negotiate more equitable terms and sustain international commerce\u2014he is screaming. Historically, well-educated suburban women vote Republican but the culture has changed since George W. Bush was elected. The party has not adequately moved with the women that are an important part of that change. Consider how much the country has altered views on gay marriage and other gender related issues, and even the minimum wage. Americans are less hued to religion and whatever their beliefs are much less inclined to generalize about Catholics, Protestants, Jews and most importantly, Muslims. Frustrations with health care insurance companies, rising cable rates and chiseling by banks like Wells Fargo have impelled women to look more toward government for solutions. They may not like ObamaCare, for example, but if Trump wants to come across as an attractive alternative to Clinton, he needs to do more than promise to replace ObamaCare with something great. He can\u2019t leave the minimum wage to the states, and he must display some leadership to calm the culture wars on gender, race and religion\u2014instead of inflaming those by promising to subject Muslims to special scrutiny. His child care proposals were a small step in the right direction but even those he left to his daughter to champion. He can\u2019t subcontract to surrogates convincing educated women he is worthy. The debates will give Trump the national stage and his last real chance to more effectively present his positions on immigration, trade and other issues that strike directly at the interests of middle-class women. Promises to make America great and safe\u2014without explaining clearly and simply how his specific policies would make ordinary Americans better off and more secure\u2014would ensure that Clinton wins.",

But it takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency \u2013 and neither candidate can get there without winning in toss-up territory. \u201cHillary Clinton starts off with an advantage,\u201d said Daron Shaw, Fox News pollster and University of Texas political science professor. \u201cBut as always, if you look at the toss-up states, this thing is going to be much more competitive, I think, than maybe a lot of us thought.\u201d According to the Fox News projections, 120 electoral votes are at stake across nine states considered pure toss-ups. These include traditional battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida, but also North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. And several additional states could be brought into play. Wisconsin and Michigan, for instance, \u201clean\u201d Democrat, but Shaw suggested Trump could put them in play given his appeal to union members and others. Likewise, Arizona and Georgia \u201clean\u201d Republican, but Clinton enjoys \u201ccore Democratic constituencies\u201d in those states, Shaw said.",

            "article_content": "John Roberts reports from New York Donald Trump put to rest Friday the speculation and revealed the worst-kept secret in Washington: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will be his running mate. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee made it official with a tweet: Pence responded that he was \"honored.\" Honored to join @realDonaldTrump and work to make America great again.  https://t.co/J8esm9LU6g Trump had originally planned to roll out his pick at a news conference in New York on Friday, but postponed the event because of the terror attack in Nice, France. Per his tweet, that event will take place Saturday morning. While the initial postponement of Trump's announcement fueled speculation that he might be having second thoughts, it was widely expected that Pence was in line for the job. The Pence pick follows a very-public vetting process that included meetings in recent days with Pence, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, among others. The selection of Pence, who went from dark horse to leading contender in a matter of days, presumably is aimed at galvanizing support from the party\u2019s conservative base as Trump charges into the Republican nominating convention. Pence was selected from a slimmer-than-usual short-list -- of candidates not only favored by Trump but also willing to stake their political future on the unconventional and unpredictable White House contender. Several prominent names publicly took themselves out of the running. Pence, also a former member of House Republican leadership, emerged relatively late in the vice presidential stakes. But he moved almost immediately to the top of the list, considering he gives the Trump campaign much-needed social conservative credentials without the kind of political baggage that Democrats had hoped to exploit in other finalists like Christie or Gingrich. Consideration of Pence also put Trump on the clock. Pence faced a Friday deadline to file paperwork to appear on the official state ballot as either a gubernatorial or vice presidential candidate. Under state law, his name could not appear on the ballot twice. Fox News learned Thursday Pence would not seek re-election, a clear sign he was gearing up for the VP announcement. And on Friday, he filed the paperwork to withdraw. The Hillary Clinton campaign quickly unloaded on Trump\u2019s decision, calling him \u201cthe most extreme pick in a generation.\u201d \u201cBy picking Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families,\u201d campaign Chairman John Podesta said in a statement. Pence, now in a tough re-election bid, spent 12 years in Congress including as the leader of the House Republican Conference. While Democrats are hammering his Tea Party ties in Congress, the 57-year-old Pence also could help Trump with critical fundraising, considering the Trump campaign has roughly $1.3 million in the bank as of the last filing, compared with Clinton, whose campaign has $42 million and a network of donors assembled through her lengthy career in politics. Pence\u2019s deputy chief of staff was a former spokesman for Koch Industries and his chief of staff in Congress later ran the Koch brothers\u2019 political umbrella organization. Still, Pence is not without some negatives, particularly his handling last year of the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The original law, which he signed, allowed residents and companies being sued by a private party to cite their religious beliefs as a defense. However, critics argued the law would allow discrimination against gays and others. The national and widespread criticism was so damaging it forced Pence and the state legislature to revise the law to clearly prohibit businesses from denying services to customers based on their sexual preference or gender choice. And it appeared to end Pence\u2019s 2016 presidential aspirations. But he was considered for VP at a time when many Republicans are steering clear of the Trump campaign and national convention. The usual clamoring to be considered for running mate didn\u2019t happen this year, in part because potential candidates were concerned about Trump\u2019s stances and comments, particularly on immigration, women, Mexicans and Muslims. Some supporters thought Trump had top-tier candidates in Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and first-term Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who might have helped Trump better connect with women voters. However, both dropped out earlier this month. Corker declined after appearing with Trump at only one campaign event. Pence, a Catholic, earned a law degree from Indiana University in 1986 and ran two unsuccessful congressional campaigns before getting elected in 2000. While in Congress, he opposed President George W. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind policy, warning it would grow the federal government. In 2006, he unveiled a \u201cno amnesty\u201d immigration plan that called for increased border security and other measures but it did not pass. He also pushed to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood and opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Though Pence ascended the House ranks to eventually become part of the chamber\u2019s GOP leadership, he lost a bid in 2006 to then-Ohio Rep. John Boehner to become the chamber\u2019s GOP minority leader. Pence passed on the opportunity to run for Senate in 2010, then made trips to early-voting states Iowa and South Carolina, which fueled speculation that he would run for president, until he launched his bid for governor in May 2011. \u201cPence is a through-and-through conservative,\u201d said Caleb Burns, a Republican strategist and partner in the Washington law firm Wiley Rein, adding Pence could \u201cenergize the workhorses of the party.\u201d He said: \u201cGiven the options, Pence was the really the only one who delivered any amount of value to the campaign. \u2026 There was no real contingency that either Gingrich or Christie would have given you -- neither geographically nor in some pocket of the party.\u201d Had he not been picked, Pence would have been facing Democrat John Gregg for a rematch of their 2012 gubernatorial face-off which Pence won by a narrow margin; polls this year suggested a rematch would be similarly close. Trump didn\u2019t meet with Pence and his wife until July 2, at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. They appeared together at a rally in central Indiana, then at a Trump high-dollar fundraiser in Indianapolis \u2013 before Trump ultimately made his choice.

Clinton is unveiling her plan to strengthen the nation\u2019s defenses against terrorism with a speech in Minnesota on Dec. 15, a state that has wrestled with terrorism recruiting for years. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (The Associated Press) Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during the 2015 National Immigration Integration Conference in New York, Monday, Dec. 14, 2015. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (The Associated Press) ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is unveiling her plan to strengthen the nation's defenses against terrorism with a speech in Minnesota, a state that has wrestled with recruiting for extremist groups for years. The middle American setting and the political timing are no accident. Fear of new attacks inspired by Islamic extremists is among voters' top concerns. And Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the United States. The community is a target for militant networks \u2014 including al-Shabab in Somalia and, more recently, the Islamic State group, according to authorities and community members. Clinton, who has been addressing the homeland security issue more forcefully in the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris and southern California, will announce her proposal Tuesday. Her campaign said she would propose a comprehensive strategy to address every step in the process that could lead to an attack like the one that occurred in San Bernardino, including recruitment, training, planning and execution. Clinton planned to point to local efforts in the Twin Cities as evidence that \"America has what it takes to meet this challenge,\" her campaign said. Some in the Somali community said they welcome Clinton's message, and hope she chooses her words carefully. \"The prevention or intervention of recruitments should be a top priority of any U.S. citizen of this country,\" said Jibril Afyare, a spokesman for a Somali-American community task force. \"We welcome her message.\" Authorities have said about a dozen Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to join jihadist groups since late 2013, and several more have tried. Just last week, a ninth Minnesota man was arrested on a charge of conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State group. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the group al-Shabab. Somalis in Minnesota have tried to stop the recruiting with strong anti-terror messages and programs aimed at creating opportunities. Minneapolis is one of three cities participating in a Justice Department pilot program that seeks to combat terror recruiting by engaging young people in their communities. The Minneapolis program will include a mentorship program, youth leadership opportunities and other initiatives, with more than $850,000 in public and private funding secured so far. Afyare, whose group is leading the Minneapolis pilot program, said it's also important for Clinton to deliver a message of unity and reject divisive, inflammatory language that has singled out Muslims. \"We don't want to brand actions of a few to be what our country is all about, what America is all about,\" he said. \"America is bigger than Donald Trump. America is bigger than hate. America is about welcoming immigrants.\" The ongoing federal investigations in Minnesota have left many Muslims, particularly those in the Somali community, feeling like they are being unfairly targeted. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said terrorist recruiting is a sensitive issue in the state. \"This community has been identified to be the no-go zone. It's been identified as an extremist community, a conservative community. It's been identified as a hotbed for terrorism,\" Hussein said. \"I think she should be very careful in choosing her words,\" he added, saying Clinton shouldn't use Minnesota's Somali community as a scapegoat or paint the entire community as extremists. Clinton has often said political leaders shouldn't demonize Muslim Americans because they can help law enforcement in rooting out extremists. \"The vast majority of Muslims are on our side of the battle unless we drive them away,\" Clinton said in a speech earlier this month in Washington. \"Declaring war on Islam or demonizing the Muslim-American community is not only counter to our values, it plays right into the hands of terrorists.\" Clinton's speech will be held at the University of Minnesota. A private fundraiser will also be held in the state, which holds March 1 caucuses. ___ Forliti reported from Minneapolis.",

Border cops pull the men, aged in their early 20s, out of their ingenious hiding places as the car attempts to cross from Morocco into the North African Spanish territory of Melilla. Footage and pictures released by the authorities show how the migrants hid in the custom-built compartments under the car and dashboard. Police said the vehicle was stopped after an officer patrolling the border area saw a young man getting out and running back towards Morocco. They then searched the car, finding the men \u2013 from Guinea in West Africa \u2013 concealed inside and showing signs of hypothermia. The driver, a 25-year-old Moroccan, was later apprehended and detained, while the migrants were taken to the Centre for Temporary Stay of Immigrants (CETI). The route is a popular one for people trying to get into the EU, as it is the only land crossing between Africa and a European country. Police say there are networks of people smugglers offering passage across the border for large sums of money. But despite being aware of this, they cannot search every car trying to cross because of concerns over queue sizes. More auto news from The Sun",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Young Americans have education and the economy at the top of their minds as they think about this year's presidential election. But their thoughts on some of the other top issues facing the country \u2014 and which of those issues are most important to them \u2014 vary among young people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. That's according to a new GenForward poll of young adults ages 18-30. The poll is conducted by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and is designed with a particular focus on the voices of young people of color. Here are some things to know about what young people think about top issues facing the country: ___ EDUCATION Asked to choose from a list of 22 topics driving their choice of a political candidate this year, education emerges on top for young Americans, with 31 percent listing it among their top three issues. Education is the top issue for young whites, African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans alike, though racism and immigration come close for young blacks and Hispanics, respectively. The survey shows that reining in the cost of college is a major concern for young adults. Three-quarters support free college education, a major policy proposal supported by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in his bid for the Democratic nomination. Young black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans are especially likely to support free college education, and to support it strongly. ___ ECONOMIC ISSUES Nearly a quarter of young Americans put economic growth at the top of their list of important political issues this year, while 18 percent say income inequality is among their top issues. Most say they see the distribution of wealth in the U.S. as unfair. Most support raising the federal minimum wage, but they prefer the incremental approach supported by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the larger increase that was supported by Sanders in his bid for the Democratic nomination. Forty-three percent say they want it raised to the $12 an hour proposed by Clinton, while 19 percent want it raised to the $15 proposed by Sanders. Another 7 percent want to go further, raising it to $20 an hour. Nearly 8 in 10 young adults support raising taxes on people making more than $1 million a year. The poll shows more young adults think free trade agreements have been good for the economy than bad, 46 percent to 20 percent. And most think free trade agreements have probably helped rather than hurt their own family's financial situation. ___ IMMIGRATION The survey shows that 6 in 10 young people think immigrants living in the United States illegally should be allowed to stay \u2014 but that feeling is not universal. That view is shared by 79 percent of young Hispanics, 75 percent of young Asian-Americans and 67 percent of young African-Americans, but just 48 percent of young whites. Two major immigration proposals put forth by businessman Donald Trump in his bid for the White House are overwhelmingly rejected by young people. Seven in 10 say the United States should not build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration. Opposition is particularly strong among young Latinos and Asian-Americans. And 69 percent oppose a temporary ban on Muslims who are not U.S citizens entering the country. Three in 10 young Hispanics say immigration is among their top issues in deciding who to support as the next president, nearly as many as say education is among their top three. ___ FOREIGN POLICY A majority of young adults say they support airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. But support varies dramatically by race and ethnicity, with young people of color far less likely than young whites to support military action. Sixty-three percent of whites age 30 and under say they support airstrikes. But only 44 percent of young Asians, 42 percent of Hispanics, and 39 percent of African-Americans say the same, with about a third of each group saying they're ambivalent. Young adults are divided on ground troops in Iraq and Syria, 35 percent in favor to 38 percent opposed. Two in 10 say terrorism and homeland security is among their top political issues this year, with young whites especially likely to say so. Overall, it tied with health care as the third most important political issue for young adults this year. ___ GUNS Americans age 18 to 30 are closely divided on whether it's more important to protect Americans' rights to own guns (48 percent) or to control gun ownership (52 percent). But there are significant differences depending on their racial and ethnic background. An overwhelming majority of young Asian-Americans \u2014 83 percent \u2014 say controlling gun ownership is more important, as do 58 percent of young African-Americans and 56 percent of young Hispanics. On the other hand, 55 percent of young whites say it's more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns. For young Asian-Americans, gun control is in their top five political issues this year. ___ The poll of 1,965 adults age 18-30 was conducted June 14-27 using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. The survey was paid for by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago using grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Ford Foundation. Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone. ___ Online: GenForward polls: http://www.genforwardsurvey.com/ Black Youth Project: http://blackyouthproject.com/ AP-NORC: http://www.apnorc.org/ ___ Follow Emily Swanson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/EL_Swan",

Congressional sources confirmed the comments, made Thursday during a summit in Baltimore, as Republican lawmakers held their own summit in Hershey, Pa. The president, who already has issued a string of veto threats in the opening days of the 114th Congress, indicated he's prepared to keep opposing legislation he finds objectionable. This includes legislation with bipartisan support. Not only has Obama threatened to veto bipartisan legislation authorizing the Keystone XL oil pipeline, he reportedly threatened to veto legislation imposing additional Iran sanctions. That bill is being written by Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, of New Jersey, and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, of Illinois. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., also indicated Thursday, at the GOP retreat, that Congress would seek to have a vote on any nuclear deal the U.S. and its allies strike with Iran. Politico reported that Obama told Democrats in Baltimore he would oppose the Iran sanctions legislation.\u00a0According to The New York Times, Menendez and Obama also traded \"sharp words\" over the issue at Thursday's meeting. The Democratic senator reportedly warned the president that, if nuclear talks failed, sanctions could not be imposed quickly without additional congressional action. Further, the president reportedly vowed Thursday to press ahead with more executive actions, despite a veritable uprising from congressional Republicans over that strategy. Earlier this week, House Republicans voted to reverse his directives from last November sparing millions of illegal immigrants from deportation and offering them work permits. Though Obama met with congressional leaders of both parties at the White House earlier this week, offering a brief show of bipartisanship, the first two weeks of the congressional session point to a turbulent two years ahead -- particularly as the session runs into the start of the 2016 presidential campaign. Obama has threatened to veto the immigration legislation and the Keystone legislation, in addition to a bill easing financial regulations and more. Asked Thursday about the White House meeting with the president, House Speaker John Boehner said they had a \"nice\" and \"polite\" conversation. \"But I don't know that we learned a whole lot,\" he said. Boehner said it's \"too early to tell\" whether the dynamic has changed. \"I'm the guy born with the glass half-full. And I believe hope springs eternal,\" he said. \"The American people want us to find a way to address their concerns. That was the big message out of the elections. You hear it from our members on both sides of the Capitol. I'm hoping the president heard the same message.\" Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

That was a media scream that registered 11 on the Richter scale as Republican Donald Trump defied media demands and went on to win the presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to concede. A nearly unanimous media failed to carry the unpopular Hillary across the finish line. Once again, America rejected the liberal Democrat. Advil set the tone early with a comment: \u201cPolitics giving you a #migraine? Advil\u00ae Migraine is the best candidate for pain relief.\u201d CNN commentator David Axelrod called it a \u201cprimal scream.\u201d ABC\u2019s Terry Moran called it \u201ca rejection of the\u00a0neoliberal world order that has\u00a0been the consensus around the\u00a0world.\u201d CNN commentator and former Obama green jobs czar Van Jones called the election a \u201cWhite-lash against a changing country.\u201d When it appeared that Hillary would not concede, after campaign chairman John Podesta appeared before her supporters in Manhattan and told everyone to go home and get some rest, even some in media criticized her. USA Today Washington correspondent Paul Singer was typical: \u201cStunned that @HillaryClinton did not concede. If @realDonaldTrump pulled that, people would go bananas.\u201d The election was a national rejection of both the traditional media and the Hollywood elite who piled on money, endorsements, appearances and offensive videos telling people to vote. Celebrities went full-on insane. Actor Mark Ruffalo vowed to do a nude scene if Clinton won. Madonna said she would perform oral sex on Clinton voters. It was so overboard that it might well have caused voters to just say no to all of star media. The night went from what CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer called a \u201creal nail-biter\u201d to one his co-anchor Jake Tapper said is, \"going to put the polling industry out of business.\u201d Left-wing Fusion referred to a \u201cTerrifying/exciting state-by-state #ElectionNight.\u201d The New York Times prediction tracker went from overwhelmingly predicting a Clinton win to 94 percent for Trump as the clock neared 11 p.m. Even when Hillary won Virginia, the Times was sending out downbeat emails saying she \u201cpreserved a slim path to victory.\u201d Trump supporter and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee joked: \u201cWouldn't wanna be under that giant glass ceiling if Hillary is forced to concede. That party might end like Carrie's prom.\u201d Fox News contributor and commentator Richard Grenell blasted the news media. \u201cThe media is for sure losing tonight no matter who pulls this off. How wrong they were.\u201d What media and pollsters had predicted would be an early night turned into a long contest. Around 8:40 p.m., liberals and media staff started to panic. Huffington Post Senior Political Reporter and Politics Managing Editor Amanda Terkel showed the tension. \u201cOffice debate right now: \u2018Trump might win!\u2019 \u2018Trump ain't going to win.\u2019\u201d By 9 pm ET it spread. CNN commentator Sally Kohn showed the typical liberal reaction. \u201cIT SHOULDN'T BE THIS CLOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Former CBS anchor Dan Rather summed it up. \u201cNearing cardiac arrest time for team Clinton.\u201d Global Editorial Director, The Huffington Post\u2019s\u00a0Howard Fineman said what was on many lips: \u201cThis is starting -- starting -- to look like an American #Brexit.\u201d The media pointed fingers at FBI head James Comey. Pundit Michael Smerconish\u00a0blamed him for the vote. \u201cChanging my @TIME 2016 person of yr prediction (who most influenced news) to James Comey #ElectionNight.\u201d Atlantic Senior Editor Adam Serwer put it succinctly: \u201cCongrats to the New York FBI office.\u201d He went further later: \u201cCongratulations to Vladimir Putin, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d Atlantic Senior Editor David Frum found another villain \u2013 Russia. \u201cWe may be living through the most successful Russian intelligence operation since the Rosenbergs stole the A-bomb.\u201d Daily Beast columnist Jonathan Alter blamed it on masculinity. \u201cTrump didn't win because of Comey. He won because he's a testosterone candidate and men weren't ready for a woman president.\u201d He continued to hammer out hyperbole: \u201cAmerica has never faced such a crisis before. World War II was 4 years but US always fairly sure we would win. This will be a new menace.\u201d Journalists had earlier celebrated as Hillary broke the \u201cthe glass ceiling.\u201d ABC gave up all pretense of neutrality and had former Clinton staffer and Clinton Foundation contributor George Stephanopoulos moderate election night coverage. Comedian Emo Phillips reflected Hollywood\u2019s agenda in one short Tweet: \u201cI don't get it. We had all the funny tweets.\u201d The New York Times showed that media bias remained an issue into election night, writing that, \u201can intense public distrust in the media is threatening the networks\u2019 traditional role as election night scorekeeper.\u201d In a think piece discussion about coverage of the race, the Times controversial media columnist Jim Rutenberg said Trump, \u201creceived coverage of a billionaire reality-television star who turned politics into performance art.\u201d He followed that up with one of the worst media bubble comments of the election: \u201cThe press needs to explore the frustration of those many Americans who think free trade\u2019s gone too far; that immigration threatens the national fabric; and that insiders from Washington, Wall Street and the media have rigged the system against them.\u201d Election Day brought out the strange in the media, as well. CBS Evening News veteran Bob Schieffer wondered if the nation were \u201cenduring some kind of curse.\u201d He added in nice biblical metaphor: \u201cWhat should we expect next \u2013 that it will rain frogs? I wouldn\u2019t bet against it.\u201d Pollster Nate Silver crowed early because he had been criticized for giving Trump a better chance to win the World Series than Trump had of becoming president. The Cubs won. \u201cThis doesn't seem like an election in which one candidate had a 99% chance of winning tbh,\u201d he Tweeted. Washington Post quasi-conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin bashed the GOP in her election day screed, urging Republicans to help Clinton succeed. \u201cDo I think all this is likely? No, but then we are among the thousands of center-right Americans who think the solution to the sclerotic GOP may very well be a new political party.\u201d Earlier in the day, The Washington Post described the ballot with a mountain full of understatement: \u201cAn acrimonious race reaches an endpoint.\u201d Of course, the Post probably described WWII as an international disagreement. The foreign press chimed in, too. German newspapers warned of a \u201cTrumpocalypse\u201d and called the GOP candidate a \u201cHorror-Clown.\u201d The Daily Mail described the vote as, \u201cClinton, Trump fight for soul of divided US before vote.\u201d Far left media grew more bizarre as the day went on. Huffington Post featured a story headlined: \u201cI Voted With My Vagina And I\u2019m Proud Of It.\u201d Buzzfeed Senior editor Rachel W. Miller retweeted a Cosmo article on anal sex with this classic comment: \u201cPretty sure this experience is worse than any cringey butt sex, Cosmo, but ok.\u201d As the perfect conclusion to the night, Huffington Post decided to stop using the controversial tagline it had on Trump stories. \u201cThe Huffington Post\u2019s editor's note calling Donald Trump as a \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018xenophobe\u2019 is no more, a source in the newsroom tells POLITICO.\u201d",

Sign up\u00a0here.** Buzz Cut: Cruz can\u2019t\u00a0flinch in Trump fight Haley shows\u00a0veepstakes strength in rebuttal Hillary gets\u00a0cold shoulder from Iowans How would a\u00a0Hillary prosecution work? Road hog CRUZ CAN\u2019T FLINCH IN TRUMP FIGHT\u00a0 NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2013 When\u00a0Ted Cruz\u00a0says that\u00a0Donald Trumphas \u201cNew York values,\u201d most Republicans know he means that Trump is not a conservative: personally, socially, fiscally or ideologically. The question is whether Cruz is ready to say that to Trump\u2019s face when they stand next to each other on stage here for the Fox Business Network Debate on Thursday. And it will be a pass/fail test for the Texas senator. After months of giving Cruz belly scratches when he rolled over for him, Trump started kicking his chief rival in national and early-state polls. And Trump is really kicking now. The celebrity businessman started with classic Trumpian concern trolling about Cruz\u2019s Canadian nativity. He was worried, Trump said, that his good friend, Ted, could run intro trouble from nasty Democrats. But as with Trump\u2019s attacks on\u00a0Ben Carson, what began as concern trolling \u2013 in that case, for his friend Ben\u2019s mental health \u2013 turned into lengthy diatribes and full-blown eruptions. Carson wouldn\u2019t respond to Trump, blamed the media and limped out of the fray and is now said to be \u201cretooling his campaign,\u201d politics talk for \u201closing badly.\u201d And so it was for\u00a0Jeb Bush, whose exclamation point began to wilt at once in the harsh orange sun of Trump. Trump would say how much he liked Jeb, and then savagely maul him for 20 minute stretches. It took Bush months to get to the point of saying he didn\u2019t like Trump. He is now promising to use his position at the far edge of the stage to try again to\u00a0assault\u00a0Trump. Like\u00a0George Costanza, Bush has thought of his comeback too late. \u201cWell, the jerk store called, and they\u2019re running out of you\u201d can be the theme for Bush\u2019s campaign denouement. Rather than delaying his response, Cruz wisely delayed the moment of first conflict. But after the start of the New Year, sensing that he was being had and with Cruz continuing to be\u00a0the stud duck in Iowa, Trump started hammering, and hammering and hammering. Cruz, to his credit, didn\u2019t seize up. He has started the response but now has the unhappy task of seeing it through. Trump will not let up and, before he is done, will bring in everything he can, likely including Cruz\u2019s wife\u2019s work for Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. Most candidates won\u2019t attack your spouse. Trump is not most candidates. So Cruz has to be ready to fight on the same terms. And that\u2019s why the \u201cNew York values\u201d attack is a good one (sorry NYC) because it covers the waterfront on Trump: his personal life, his business busts, his social views, his version of Christianity, his insults, his temperament \u2013 total package. But if Cruz tries to flinch from his new path when they get to South Carolina on Thursday it will be his undoing. Think of that moment when\u00a0Tim Pawlenty\u00a0wouldn\u2019t repeat even his lame \u201cO\u2019RomneyCare\u201d jab against GOP frontrunner\u00a0Mitt Romney. Cue the bugler for \u201cTaps.\u201d Making Cruz\u2019s task trickier is that Trump tends to dial back in debates. He knows that the crowd-pleasing attacks from his rallies don\u2019t play well in these forums and holds back. That means Cruz has to take the extra step of trying to draw Trump out and risk looking like the bully himself. But he\u2019s got to get Trump, as Cruz called it, \u201crattled.\u201d Otherwise, Trump will grin under the mindful gaze of the moderators and then go back to shivs, shanks and brickbats as soon as the debate ends. Cruz has to own it and be prepared to go punch for punch with Trump to the end. Cruz\u00a0might\u00a0lose if he fights. But if he follows the path of Bush and Carson, Cruz\u00a0will\u00a0lose.\u00a0 Not just a river in Egypt -\u00a0On Tuesday\u2019s \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Sen.\u00a0Ted Cruzknocked the president\u2019s speech calling it a \u201cstate of denial\u201d and knocking the president on a weak foreign policy in wake of the ten U.S. seamen being captured, and now released, in Iran. Watch\u00a0here. Pro-Cruz PAC puts the amnesty bull\u2019s-eye on Rubio -\u00a0NYT: \u201cLate Tuesday, a \u2018super PAC\u2019 supporting Senator\u00a0Ted Cruz\u00a0released\u00a0a\u00a0long-awaited ad\u00a0yoking Mr. Rubio to Mr. Schumer and Mr. Obama, citing Mr. Rubio\u2019s work on the so-called Gang of Eight effort at comprehensive immigration legislation in 2013. And on Monday, the group Right to Rise USA, the\u00a0super PAC\u00a0supporting\u00a0Jeb Bush, released an ad criticizing Mr. Rubio for having gone from promising to \u2018oppose amnesty\u2019 in his 2010 United States Senate campaign to working on the immigration bill.\u201d Christie says Planned Parenthood donation a \u2018misquote\u2019 -\u00a0In an interview with WaPo Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie\u00a0explains\u00a0the report about him saying he donated to Planned Parenthood: \u201cWhat about a report in 1994 that quoted him as saying he personally gave to Planned Parenthood? \u2018Listen, this is a quote from 21 years ago. I\u2019m convinced it was a misquote. Understand what was going on. In 1994-95, I was fighting\u00a0against\u00a0county funding of Planned Parenthood even though I was pro-choice.\u2019 He said he was making the case then that people could spend their own money on a cause they believed in, just as he did. He is emphatic he was not referencing Planned Parenthood\u00a0specifically\u00a0as the kind of cause he gave money to.\u201d Haley shows veepstakes strength in rebuttal - David Drucker\u00a0writes\u00a0that South Carolina Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley\u2019s rebuttal to\u00a0President Obama\u2019s State of the Union should put her in the top spot for a vice presidential pick. Drucker says, \u201cHaley was praised for her delivery and her eloquent and sharp rhetoric. She displayed an ability to marry an aggressive pitch for conservative values, such as stating that illegal immigration must be stopped, with calls for inclusiveness and respect for people with which Republicans disagree. For a party that is simultaneously looking for strong leadership and a messenger that can help the GOP appeal to an increasingly diverse electorate that has increasingly sided with the Democratic Party in presidential elections. The performance should immediately elevate the second-term Indian American governor, who is just 43 years old, into top consideration for her party's vice presidential nod.\u201d WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 The Oxford English Dictionary,\u00a0the most comprehensive, most authoritative of them all owes a great deal to the work of a madman. Atlas Obscura has theweird, wonderful tale\u00a0of editor\u00a0James Murray\u00a0and\u00a0William Chester Minor: \u201cMurray and Minor wrote each other often, but Murray didn\u2019t learn that his most prolific contributor lived in a psychiatric hospital until he traveled 50 miles to see him in 1896, nearly two decades after they first got in touch. This fact helped to explain why Minor had been strangely absent from society parties and talks, despite seeming so engaged with the literary scene of the day.\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The enthusiasm gap spilled abundantly into view in recent days, from the cheering crowds and emotional outpourings that greeted Mr. Sanders, and in interviews with more than 50 Iowans at campaign stops for both candidates. Voters have mobbed Mr. Sanders at\u00a0events since Friday, some jumping over chairs to shake his hand or snap a selfie\u2026With a new poll showing\u00a0Mr. Sanders surging ahead in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton and her aides have dropped any pretense that they can ignore Mr. Sanders or treat him like a gadfly. They have become zealous and combative as they try new ways to undercut his high favorability ratings.\u201d Keeps attacking on guns -\u00a0Time: \u201cFor a week now, Hillary Clinton and her allies have been hammering Sanders on the vote, making the case that he is a failed progressive champion on\u00a0the crucial issue of gun control\u2026To this, Sanders has not had a clear reply. On the one hand, Sanders has stood by the controversial 2005 law, saying that it was intended to protect mom-and-pop gun shop owners from legal liability. On the other, Sanders has said he might reverse himself in the future, with spokesman\u00a0Michael Briggs\u00a0explaining to TIME he would likely support legislation holding large manufacturers liable\u2014all while still shielding the local dealers in Vermont Sanders wants to protect.\u201d Chelsea joins fray as mom\u2019s attack dog -\u00a0CBS News: \u201c[Campaigning in New Hampshire,\u00a0Chelsea Clinton\u00a0said:] said Sanders would \u2018dismantle\u2019 Obamacare, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and Medicare -- along with private insurance programs. Clinton went even further, arguing that Sanders' plan would \u2018empower\u2019 Republican governors to eliminate health insurance for low-income and middle-income Americans.\u201d Holder endorses Hillary -\u00a0AP: \u201cAs she works to maintain an advantage among African-American voters in her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton has secured an endorsement from the nation's first black attorney general. The Clinton campaign announced\u00a0Eric Holder's support in a statement to the Associated Press. Holder, who served as\u00a0President Barack Obama\u2019s top law enforcement appointee for more than five years, said Clinton \u2018is the candidate that we need in the White House\u2019 to continue \u2018the progress of President Obama.\u2019\u201d How would a Hillary prosecution work? -\u00a0RCP\u2019s\u00a0Charles Lipson\u00a0gives thepossible outcomes\u00a0of the FBI\u2019s long investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email.

ROAD HOGThe Guardian: \u201cRussia has detained a senior prison service official on suspicion of stealing a 30-mile (50km) stretch of public road, investigators said.\u00a0Alexander Protopopov\u00a0oversaw the dismantling of a concrete highway and sold off the slabs while prison service chief in the far-northern Komi region, the Investigative Committee said in a statement. The road, which was made up of more than 7,000 reinforced concrete slabs, was \u2018dismantled and driven away\u2019 over more than a year, between 2014 and 2015. The slabs were subsequently used by a company that sold them on for a profit, investigators said. Protopopov, now acting deputy chief of the national prison service, faces charges of misappropriating state property while using his official position, which could lead to 10 years in jail.\u201d Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

The whale is getting ready to surface \u2022 Can Cameron come out ahead in U.K. kerfuffle? \u2022 But the caucuses were really something UNCOVERED AUDIO: HILLARY WAS \u2018ADAMANTLY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\u2019The RNC today is shelling presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in her bunker with newly uncovered audio from a 2003 radio interview she gave as a senator. Apparently asked about the issue of illegal immigration, which was a hot button in the state at the time, Clinton swung hard: \u201cI am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants.\u201d Clinton, on the campaign trail in Nevada Wednesday, promised to push for citizenship for those in the country illegally. She also vowed to go beyond President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants if Republicans do not acquiesce. Obama\u2019s order has so far been blocked by federal courts.In the audio from the RNC of what the committee says is Clinton\u2019s interview with radio host John Gambling, Clinton calls for more border security and for employers to stop hiring illegal immigrants. \u201cCome up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties, stand in the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx,\u201d she is heard to complain \u201cYou\u2019re going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work.\u201dCLINTONS GET CREATIVE ON CAMPAIGN CASH: IF DISCLOSURE \u2018LOOKS BAD,\u2019 DON\u2019T DISCLOSEIf you thought that\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0would be more bashful about buckraking given the current scandals surrounding her family finances and those of its foundation, you haven\u2019t been paying attention. Clinton is\u00a0vacuuming up\u00a0money in California this week, but behind the scenes her campaign is busy blurring lines on campaign cash. First, Clinton will do what Democrats once reviled and\u00a0raise cash for her super PAC. President Obama endorsed his super PAC, but stopped short of plumping for checks. (Candidates can\u2019t legally make the ask, but they can probably stand next to the guy with his hand out \u2013 wink-wink, nudge-nudge \u2013 and swear up and down that they are not coordinating their efforts.) Second, Clinton is\u00a0so far not disclosing\u00a0the identities of the bundlers, the mostly wealthy partisans who collect checks from their friends for campaigns. You know \u2013 bundlers. Releasing the names is not a legal requirement, but it has been standard practice for presidential candidates of both parties. You\u2019d think Clinton would want to be more forthcoming about where her money comes from these days. But as her husband said\u200b,\u00a0\u201cAny kind of disclosure is a target\u201d that it \u201clooks bad.\u201d So the answer to the lengthening list of questions for the candidate and her campaign is less disclosure and more blurry fundraising lines.Who made varsity this season? -\u00a0A memo\u00a0obtained\u00a0by Bloomberg gives all the names of Clinton\u2019s campaign\u00a0A-team this time around. Not a lot of familiar faces, signaling a desire for change in this election cycle.No pictures allowed, Clinton Foundation guests gather in Morocco -\u00a0ABC News:\u00a0\u201cWhen ABC News producers attempted to take pictures of guests arriving at the front entrance, Moroccan police threatened their arrest. The foundation\u2019s spokesman initially professed not to know where the reception was being held, and the location was among the only not included on schedules handed out to the media and published online.\u201dHillary personal email use \u2018not acceptable\u2019 says State Dept. -\u00a0The Hill:\u00a0\"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account run through a private server was 'not acceptable'\u00a0and happened without officials\u2019 knowledge, a top State Department record-keeper said on Wednesday. 'I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable,'\u00a0Joyce Barr, the State Department\u2019s assistant secretary for the Bureau of Administration, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"TRADE ROILS BOTH PARTIES AS AIR OBAMA HEADS TO NIKEAs he laces up to tout his trade deal at Nike\u2019s Oregon headquarters \u2013 an intriguing choice given the company\u2019s sweat-shop past \u2013 President Obama\u2019s push for fast track authority is proving to be far from a slam dunk in Congress. Indeed, with Obama pressing reluctant Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner are trying put a buzzer beater. But opposition to the deal is stiff on both sides of the aisle and the pact is no more popular with Sixteeners of both stripes. Breaking with GOP frontrunners who support the deal, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee trash-talked the trade pact, warning that American workers could \u201ctake it up the backside\u201d under the current proposal. \u201cFast-track means nobody\u2019s paying attention,\u201d Huckabee said. Among Democrats, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley are strongly opposed. And where is Hillary Clinton in all this? On the bench, where she says she\u2019s \u201cwatching closely.\u201dBernie heckles - \u201cNike epitomizes why disastrous unfettered free-trade policies during the past four decades have failed American workers, eroded our manufacturing base and increased income and wealth inequality in this country,\u201d Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., penned in a letter to the president Tuesday. \u201cJust don\u2019t do it,\u201d Sanders wrote.Why Nike? - National Journal takes a detailed look at the apparel giant, which is headquartered in the U.S. but does most of its business overseas: \u201cNike made $12.4 billion in profits last year, thanks in large part to 1 million subcontracted workers at factories primarily in low-wage countries in Asia. For years, the company has faced allegations that a number of those factories use sweatshop conditions and illegally low wages to produce sneakers and clothes that Nike then sells in much wealthier countries.\u201dWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026One of the most famous photographs in sports journalism is of the 1965 game between rival schools Deerfield Academy and Mount Hermon in which the game went on before full stands as a huge fire consumed Mount Hermon\u2019s science building right behind the bleachers. Would you like to know the story behind the famous photo? NYT has the details: \u201cHalftime came. Officials conferred about how to handle the nettlesome situation. In a decision that surely would not be made in today\u2019s safety-conscious, litigious world, they decided it would be better if the teams just carried on. \u2018We were told to suck it up and play,\u2019 [one Mount Hermon player] recalled.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

THE WHALE IS GETTING READY TO SURFACEAs three more fish joined the growing school of Republican presidential candidates this week, the whale in the race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has be staying far below the surface. Bush has been quiet lately, with no public events and an under the radar op-ed in the Chicago Tribune. Some advisers told the WaPo not to expect an announcement for at least a month. But others have told Fox News First that the official announcement will be sooner than that and done in a low key manner \u2013 as might befit a candidate with 99 percent name recognition among Republican voters. (While a candidate like Scott Walker, still unknown to 1 in 5 Republicans in the latest WSJ/NBC News poll needs a lift from his eventual launch, Bush will be risk-averse.) So when does the whale of a candidate come to the surface? Perhaps his speech at Liberty University\u2019s commencement this Saturday will be just that spray.How Jeb sank Christie - National Journal: \u201cFrom the time a Bush candidacy started looking more likely, the wind came out of [New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s] presidential sails to the point when he was effectively dead in the water. It was mostly because Bush filled a void that Christie planned to fill in himself.

            "article_content": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and his wife, Diana, leave the stage after his concession speech in Richmond, Va., Tuesday, June 10, 2014. (AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Cantor\u2019s defeat, mythbuster edition \u2022 So what the heck did happen? \u2022 Power Play: Can Franken get the last laugh? \u2022 No se puede \u2022 Your winner, by default CANTOR\u2019S DEFEAT, MYTHBUSTER EDITIONA lavish mythology has already arisen around the shocking defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who despite a 28-to-1 cash advantage, a late-game media blitz and 13 years of incumbency, lost to an economics professor at a small college in the district. To know what happened, we first ought to know what didn\u2019t happen. Myth - Cantor was upended in a low-turnout election by a small number of tea party radicals. Reality - The results in Cantor\u2019s defeat, the first-ever primary loss by a sitting House majority leader saw a marked rise in turnout from 2012: a 28-percent turnout increase from the presidential-election year. You may feel free to lament the poor levels of American civic involvement, generally. But this is not a case of low-turnout electoral distortion. Myth - A wave of immigration outrage among downscale voters in lower-income rural and far suburban precincts overwhelmed Cantor\u2019s complacent electoral base in upper-income precincts in and near Richmond. Reality - Immigration seems to be the chief animating issue here, but this was not blue-collar versus white-collar voters. Turnout was up fairly uniformly across the district, including the affluent sections of Cantor\u2019s home county of Henrico, which the majority leader lost too. From precincts with median incomes near the poverty line in places like rural Louisa County to those nibbling strictly upper crust in the West End of Richmond, the electorate was energized and not digging the incumbent. Myth - Democrats crossed over in Virginia\u2019s non-partisan primary to do mischief and sabotage the stronger Republican candidate to improve their chances in the fall. Reality - There is no evidence of any chaos operations here. While turnout was up in every part of the district, the increase lagged in the most Democratic neighborhoods, with the City of Richmond up 22 percent compared to Republican strongholds like Goochland County which jumped 28 percent. Plus, Democrats have slim hopes of winning the district, which leans heavily Republican, this fall. Cantor is all but certain to abide by voters\u2019 wishes and the state party has already blessed Brat\u2019s candidacy. The incentive for mischief was low. And with a 10-point margin of victory, any disingenuous Democrats would be strictly background noise. Myth - The race was another battle in the national civil war between the tea party and the Republican establishment. Reality - New nominee Dave Brat got a big boost from talk radio heavy hitters like Mark Levin, but this was a very local election. While tea party groups are stampeding to Richmond to lay claim to Brat\u2019s success, they\u2019re late in coming. Brat had zero backing from any of the national groups that are forever raising money for their fight against the GOP old guard. Brat is certainly more conservative than Cantor, but he hardly fits the preferred national narrative. [\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a contest between the tea party and the Republicans and all this.\u00a0 Although I had tremendous tea party support and just wonderful people in the tea party grass roots helping me out, and they\u2019re clearly responsible for the win, but I ran on the Republican principles.\u201d \u2013 Dave Brat on \u201cHannity.\u201d Watch full interview here.] SO WHAT THE HECK DID HAPPEN?Eric Cantor has an impressive national organization, deep pockets and has successfully helped shift the national GOP\u2019s thinking on a host of issues other than immigration. But if the folks at home are fed up with business as usual, look out. This race has already been over interpreted and that will only get worse. But just remember what Dave Brat\u2019s key pitch was: he ran as Cantor\u2019s \u201cterm limit.\u201d Americans of all stripes are deeply fed up with the status quo in Washington, and while Cantor\u2019s flip-floppery on immigration certainly provided rocket fuel for the effort to oust him, his role as the face of the GOP establishment in general was a huge hindrance. Veering, sneering - Cantor made several mistakes, ignoring the challenge, then turning bitterly negative in the closing weeks. It was a sour message compared to those of sweetly successful incumbents like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who emphasized the commonalities he shared with his rivals and asked for mercy on disagreements. Graham won easily last night as an avowed moderate in a very conservative state. Cantor wasn\u2019t a straight shooter. He attended a retreat for an anti-tea party group led by former Rep. Steve LaTourette this spring and was clearly part of an effort to beat back the conservative insurgency. But as his own race appeared to grow more competitive, Cantor suddenly shifted. He deep-sixed immigration and vowed no action this year. But then, after his pollsters erroneously declared him safe, Cantor flipped back the other way with approving words for legalizations for limited groups of illegal immigrants. Veering and insincere-sounding, Cantor wrongly believed that his clout, incumbency and money would be enough. [How about a refund? \u2013 A poll from McLaughlin & Associates poll claimed Cantor had a 28 point lead over Brat at the end of May.] Nobody loves you when you\u2019re down and out - Another oft-overlooked piece in all this: the political consequences of a federal debt of more than $17 trillion. When congressional leaders could pour pork on their districts, grouchy constituents could be mollified with new roads and other treats. But there are no ribbon cutting ceremonies for sequestrations. Without earmarks, Cantor couldn\u2019t make the folks at home listen. Leadership without extra spending perks is no prize. MEET DAVE BRATEconomics Professor Dave Brat will head to class with a new title, Republican House nominee. The 49-year old teaches at Randolph-Macon College, a small, liberal arts school north of Richmond. Throughout the campaign, Brat attacked Rep. Eric Cantor as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d in Washington, who has lost touch with Virginians\u2019 wants from ending ObamaCare to reducing debt. A native of Detroit, Brat received his doctorate of economics at American University. He and his wife Laura live with their two children, in Henrico County. Award winning staff? - Cantor\u2019s staff is a large orchestration, with 23 paid employees. David Brat seems to have taken it down a notch with only a couple of paid staffers. Washington Examiner\u2019s Betsy Woodruff interviews Brat\u2019s 23-year-old campaign manager Zachary Werrell who interviewed for a job at Panera Bread Company and has been crashing on the couch of his mentor. Going to be awkward at faculty meetings \u2013 Virginia\u2019s 7th District House race had a Randolph-Macon sweep. Brat will face fellow Randolph-Macon College assistant professor Jack Trammell, 50, to succeed Cantor in the November election. In a heavily Republican district, Trammell didn\u2019t stand a chance against Cantor. Since Brat outshined Cantor, Trammell sees a glimmer of hope heading into the fall. Before Tuesday\u2019s primary, Trammell had a haphazardly designed website. Now it seems that Democrats have thrown support behind the candidate launching a new website and social media outreach. [If the November election was based on the quality of the professor, Trammell would have Brat beat. Students voted Trammell overall quality a 4.3 \u2013out of 5\u2014versus Brat\u2019s 3.4 rating, but students rate Brat to be very easy on the eyes.] GOP LEADERSHIP UP IN THE AIRMajority Leader Eric Cantor has a decision to make: whether he\u2019ll relinquish his role as House majority leader. Republican leaders are meeting to wrestle with that issue this morning. Sources tell Fox News First that Cantor is expected to at least offer to step aside, but whether or not that\u2019s what the conference wants is unclear. But, as the Daily Beast reports, \u201cOne thing is clear: The shuffle to replace Cantor has already begun. While Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the House majority whip and next in line behind Cantor, is sure to run for the upcoming vacancy, his election is not a foregone conclusion at this point. Look to\u00a0former Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), conservative darling Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), and Pete Sessions (R-TX) as potential candidates to mount strong challenges.\u201d Giving them the business - WaPo: \u201cThe country's most powerful business lobbying groups already knew they had a problem with the GOP when Tea Party lawmakers nearly forced the country into a massive default of its debt last year. But with Eric Cantor's shocking defeat Tuesday night, things for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable just got a whole lot worse. For one, they lost a major defender of their favored policies--from the beneficial tax treatment of private equity income to immigration reforms favored by the country's biggest tech companies\u2026.It's true that Cantor enjoyed a strong relationship with business, especially with Wall Street. The industry that gave him the most campaign contributions was the securities and investment sector. Individuals from the private equity firm Blackstone were his biggest financial supporters. Cantor went to bat for the industry repeatedly over politically unpopular issues, including the taxation of income at private equity firms at the lower capital gains rate.\u201d NO SE PUEDEWSJ: \u201cThe defeat Tuesday of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to an underfunded challenger who ran as an immigration opponent is likely to further weaken already shaky prospects the House will consider immigration legislation this summer. For months, Republicans have worried an immigration debate could make incumbents vulnerable to primary challenges from the right, and have put off any House action at least until after primary season. Tuesday\u2019s primaries were the last hurdle before what was expected to be a final push by immigration advocates for action. Mr. Cantor\u2019s defeat is likely to be seen as confirmation immigration politics are too dicey for this election year and may spook rank-and-file members who advocates have been pressing for support.\u201d But Obama can - \u201cThis is the end of the discussion about what's going to happen on any kind of immigration, anything in this Congress. It's a dead letter. It's not coming back because Eric Cantor's defeat has sealed that. The president has been threatening this all along which if the Republicans didn't give what he wanted he would carry through on executive action.\u201d \u2013 Chris Stirewalt on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d OTHER CHALLENGERS HOPE TO GET A GUST FROM BRATThe Hill: \u201cConservative hopefuls across the nation were claiming Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) primary challenger David Brat\u2019s victory as their own Tuesday night. Radiologist Milton Wolf, challenging Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) in his primary, and Tennessee state Rep. Joe Carr, running against Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), both said Brat\u2019s stunning upset had implications for their own equally long-shot bids\u201d. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Real Clear Science features Science 2.0\u2019s Norm Benson as he hoists a cold one to thank beer for civilization: \u201cEvidence mounts almost daily that beer started humans on the path to civilization even before the invention of agriculture some twelve thousand years ago. A paper in\u00a0Evolutionary Anthropology\u00a0says that, based on tests of artifacts,\u00a0cereal grains were collected (sometimes from areas as far as sixty miles away) \u201cfor the purposes of brewing beer\u201d to be used in feasts, which then \u201cled to domestication...\u201d\u00a0That is, brewing led to the collecting of seeds for cultivation. And, feasts in prehistoric times were given for much the same reasons as they are today: to mark religious events or to impress others and also to make social, political, and commercial connections.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Lindsey Graham fended off a field of Tea Party-backed challengers Tuesday night to win the state\u2019s Republican primary and the right to try for a third term in November. The 58-year-old Graham was declared the winner by the Associated Press after taking about 57 percent of the vote with 96 percent of precincts reporting. State Sen. Lee Bright came in second, with about 15 percent. Graham, considered one of the most vulnerable incumbent Republican senators in this year's cycle, needed at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff against one of his six opponents, all of whom had criticized him for not being conservative enough. But Graham, who has been in office since 2002, had a hefty fundraising advantage. He has raised more than $12 million since his last re-election bid, in 2008, while none of his opponents passed the $1 million mark. Graham will face Democratic state Sen. Brad Hutto and Libertarian Victor Kocher in November in the largely conservative state.\u201d PICK SIX: DAN\u2019S THE MAN ON THE FRONTIERRepublicans are hoping to pick up an additional six seats to gain control of the Senate this November. Which Democrat-held seats will prove to be the most likely flips for the red team? The current consensus among Fox News First readers: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and West Virginia. Fox News First reader Barbara Granger, who pointed to Alaska\u2019s vulnerable Democratic Sen. Mark Begich early this year for Pick Six, gives a nod to Republican challenger Mead Treadwell while backing GOP frontrunner Dan Sullivan. \u201c I\u2019ve known Mead Treadwell from working on winning campaigns together,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut Dan is the only one for our senate seat!\u201d\u00a0Alaska\u2019s primary is August 19. POWER PLAY: CAN FRANKEN GET THE LAST LAUGH?Host Chris Stirewalt heads north to discuss the race to secure Senate state in Minnesota and Michigan.\u00a0 Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn, heads into November with no clear GOP challenger yet, but will he be able to hold on the his seat in the land of\u00a010,000 lakes? Watch Chris\u2019s prediction here. YOUR WINNER, BY DEFAULTThere were eight Democrats on the ballot vying to face Gov. Brian Sandoval, R-Nev., in November, and state Economic Development Commissioner Robert Goodman should be fine with 25 percent, right? \u00a0Yes but, Goodman and the rest of the field were bested when the tally showed that Nevadans had turned up their noses and awarded the victory to \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d with a 30 percent of the vote. Nevada allows its voters to select the \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d in elections for President and statewide offices. Of course \u201cnone\u201d can\u2019t actually run, although some in the state think the law ought to be changed on that front, so Goodman gets the nod. But really, when 20,000 voters in your state are motivated to pull the lever for \u201cnone,\u201d beating you by 3,600 votes, it has to take some of the sweetness out of your victory lap. Bolstered by Tuesday\u2019s results, the democrat will take on Sandoval, Nevada's first Hispanic governor, who rolled to victory over four challengers with 90 percent of the vote and is expected to easily defeat Goodman to win a second term. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThe problem with Hillary Clinton that you see in this is her sort of intrinsic insincerity. She\u2019s continually crafting what she says. Crafting what her position is going to be. Crafting her conduct to meet a certain perception. And when you do that day in and day out either on a book tour or on a campaign trail or anywhere in public office, you trip up because you can\u2019t remember the last confection, the last creation of yourself that you put together.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report w/Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.

            "article_content": "San Francisco lawmaker wants to allow undocumented parents to vote in school board elections After two failed bids to grant voting rights to illegal immigrants, some San Francisco officials believe they have found the man who can make it happen: Donald Trump. A proposed charter amendment drafted by Board of Supervisors member Eric Mar would give illegal immigrants with kids in the public school system the right to vote in school elections. Voters have rejected two previous ballot proposals, but Mar is betting on anti-Trump sentiment to carry the pro-illegal immigrant proposal if he can get it on the November ballot. \u201cWith Donald Trump\u2019s racist and anti-immigrant sentiments, there is a reaction from many of us who are disgusted by those politics,\" Mar said. \"I think that\u2019s going to ensure there is strong Latino turnout as well as other immigrant turnout.\u201d Mar is hoping anti-Trump sentiment will get his measure passed. A key promise in Trump's campaign for the Republican nomination for president has been to build a wall on the Mexican border. This week, Trump claimed a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University wouldn\u2019t be impartial because he is of Mexican heritage. Mar staffers confirmed the measure will go before the rules committee within weeks, and could then be presented to the full board of supervisors. If a majority support it, the charter amendment will be on the ballot Nov. 8 when the city and nation votes for president. \u201cThe time is right for San Francisco to make history, to pave the way for immigrant parents to have a say in the policy decisions that impact their child\u2019s education and who gets to sit on the Board of Education,\u201d Mar said in a written statement. In 2004, voters narrowly rejected the same proposal. A similar measure, introduced by California Assemblymember David Chiu, D-San Francisco, failed in 2010 with just 46 percent of the vote. Chiu believes Trump's presence on the ballot, and the fact that one of every three children in the system is now the child of an immigrant parent could make the third time a charm. \u201cWith the anti-immigrant rhetoric from Donald Trump, it is more important than ever that we come together as San Franciscans to stand up for our immigrant communities and support their civic engagement,\u201d Chiu said in a written statement. The plan is \u201cbad public policy,\u201d according to Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Federal Elections Commission member. \u201cIt is wrong to extend the vote to individuals who have not entered the American social compact or made a commitment to the our Constitution, our law, and our cultural and political heritage by becoming citizens,\u201d von Spakovsky said. \u201cIt is even worse to extend the franchise to illegal aliens whose very first act is to violate our laws; that encourages contempt for the law.\u201d While laws in all 50 states bar noncitizens from voting in state elections, and federal law makes it a felony for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, there is an opening in local elections, von Spakovsky acknowledged. Seven jurisdictions - including 6 in Maryland and one in Chicago \u2013 afforded voting rights to noncitizens, Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at Queens College of the City University of New York, told the Chronicle.",

(AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 The opacity of ObamaCare \u2022 Obama: Immigration action \u2018Going to happen\u2019 \u2022 Axelrod to Hillary: \u2018Get out of the cocoon\u2019 \u2022 It\u2019s official, Warren now Senate Dems link to liberals \u2022 Space jam THE OPACITY OF OBAMACARE\u201cWhat we need to do is be transparent,\u201d Health and Human Services head Sylvia Burwell announced earlier this week on the eve of ObamaCare\u2019s reboot. How ironic, given the recent exposure of just how opaque the curtain of deception behind which the president\u2019s unpopular health law was sold has been. As more damaging video of ObamaCare architect Johnathan Gruber continues to hit the internet, Democrats are doing their best to dance away from his disparaging comments about American voters. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi went as far as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. He didn\u2019t help write our bill,\u201d during a press conference Thursday. But that wasn\u2019t Pelosi\u2019s tune leading up to the health law\u2019s passage. Fox News: \u201cAt the time, her office put out a \u2018health insurance reform mythbuster\u2019 press release pointing to the work of \u2018noted MIT health care economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019 in examining the House bill\u2019s impact on premiums. They noted that Gruber found it \u2018would result in lower premiums than under current law for the millions of Americans using the newly-established Health Insurance Exchange.\u2019\u201d Of course the clouds covering an administration\u2019s touted transparency shouldn\u2019t be surprising given sunny forecasts Americans were sold like \u201cyou can keep it\u201d that ultimately fell flat for all to see. [\u201cWe were subjected during the Obamacare debate to a whole lot of stuff that we all knew was not true, not even close to true. And what this insider is saying confirms that they were spinning tales from beginning to end because they knew they couldn\u2019t tell the truth about Obamacare and have a chance of passing it even with a Democratic Senate with 60 votes.\u201d\u2014Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a press conference Thursday.] The hits keep coming - The latest discoveries on the Gruber internet hit parade include a video that shows him bragging about how the Massachusetts health care system he helped design worked by ripping off millions of dollars from the federal government, and another clip from Vermont in which he mocks a critic of single-payer health care, comparing him to an \u201cadolescent\u201d child.\u00a0And there are more. Dr. K\u2019s Prescription: Candid candor - Syndicated Columnist Charles Krauthammer examines what the deluge of demeaning videos from ObamaCare architect Johnathan Gruber reveals about the passage of the law : \u201cThis may have been a stupid idea, but it was no slip. And it\u2019s the law, as written, as enacted and as intended. It can be changed by Congress only, not by the Executive\u2026 It\u2019s refreshing that \u2018the most transparent administration in history,\u2019 as this administration fancies itself, should finally display candor about its signature act of social change. Inadvertently, of course. But now we know what lay behind Obama\u2019s smooth reassurances -- the arrogance of an academic liberalism that rules in the name of a citizenry it mocks, disdains and deliberately, contemptuously deceives.\u201d Shh\u2026it\u2019s ObamaCare 2.0 - Following last year\u2019s disastrous rollout of ObamaCare\u2019s Web site, team Obama is setting the bar significantly lower and taking a much quieter approach to its second enrollment period, which opens Saturday. This time there will be no celebrity glitz and glam, massive advertising budget or Pajama Boy to encourage young people to enroll in the entitlement program. WSJ: \u201cTop administration officials plan to fan out for an appeal that relies on customer testimonial and uses a smaller marketing budget\u2026\u2018Join the millions\u2019 will be part of the pitch during the enrollment period, which ends Feb. 15, officials said\u2026 [T]he administration will rely heavily on targeted digital ads and social media\u2026Officials hope to expand small-scale efforts to organize groups such as bartenders and cabdrivers.\u201d Fine me! - According to a new Gallup Poll, 35 percent of uninsured individuals will opt to pay ObamaCare\u2019s penalties than purchase insurance through its exchanges.

Obama told reporters he would not \u201cstand by\u201d and that his proposed fixes to the nation\u2019s immigration system were \u201cway overdue.\u201d\u00a0The president continued to blame Republican inaction to justify his go-it-alone plans, \u201cI indicated to Speaker [John Boehner] several months ago that if in fact Congress failed to act I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better.\u201d The president was emphatic about his intention to pursue executive action saying, \u201cThat\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s going to happen before the end of the year.\u201dConservatives push funding fight - Washington Examiner: \u201cConservative lawmakers and groups are pushing Republican leaders to pass a short-term government spending bill so that they will have more power to defund any executive action from President Obama on immigration as well as other measures. Government funding runs out Dec. 12, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are leaning toward passing an omnibus appropriations bill funding the government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Doing so, advocates of that strategy say, would avoid a messy and contentious government shutdown or more brinksmanship early in the new year after a wave GOP election in which voters expressed a desire for bipartisan cooperation. But conservative members of the GOP conference argue that passing an omnibus spending bill would give away most, if not all, of the leverage they can exert in the next year against Obama and Democrats.\u201dGOP considers legal action on Obama immigration move - WaPo: \u201cHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) is considering expanding a proposed federal lawsuit over President Obama\u2019s executive orders to include action on immigration. Filing a separate lawsuit over the president\u2019s authority to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation is another option that gained traction Thursday during talks among party leaders.\u201dOBAMA NOT BUDGING ON PIPELINE President Obama would not budge from the \u201cdim\u201d view his administration has of a legislative push on the Keystone pipeline ahead of a key House vote on the project slated for today. At a press conference in Burma, the president said he wants to let a review process \u2013 now in its sixth year - run its course. Pressed by Republican leadership to state where he stands, Obama said his administration believes the project should be judged on the basis of whether it accelerates climate change. Obama also insisted the pipeline would not be a \u201cmassive jobs bill\u201d and would have no effect on U.S. gas prices. Senate Republicans and several moderate Democrats have pushed for the project to be approved for years. Supporters say the construction of the pipeline would create tens of thousands of jobs. But the project divides Democrats, with environmentalists in opposition while some unions as well as energy-state and business-minded lawmakers support it. The Senate is expected to hold a vote on the pipeline Tuesday. Fox News has more. Fox News Sunday: Changing climate - Host Chris Wallace welcomes Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen.

The second manned mission to the lunar surface, carrying astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard Gordon and Alan Bean, started off with harrowing moments of its own. With Richard Nixon, the first president to view the liftoff of a manned mission looking on, lightning struck the ascending Saturn 5 rocket just 36 seconds after launch and again at 16 seconds later. The strikes tripped circuit breakers, cutting off power to the Apollo command module.\u00a0 Fortunately, the rocket continued its ascent normally, power was restored and 5 days later the lunar module Intrepid made a precision landing on the Ocean of Storms. Conrad and Bean spent 32 hours on the moon\u2019s surface conducting two spacewalks. On November 24th, Apollo 12 splashed down in the Pacific, just 3 miles from one of its recovery ships, the U.S.S. Hornet. Universetoday.com retraces the electrifying launch here. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

According to ESA, Rosetta\u2019s instruments first heard the odd sounds from the comet in August when the probe came within 62 miles (100 km) of the comet. The sounds reappeared during recent maneuvers to bring Rosetta into position to release the Philae lander. The comet song capture by Rosetta is produced by \u2018oscillations in the magnetic field in the comet\u2019s environment,\u2019 ESA officials said in a statement.

            "article_content": "Legal panel breaks down heated case from Texas The Supreme Court on Monday is poised to once again enter the fray on the abortion issue, an already divisive subject complicated by election-year politics and a split bench that may lack the votes to rule definitively. The high court will wrap up its work for the summer by issuing a judgment on how far Texas can go to regulate abortion clinics in the state, and whether those provisions have the effect of limiting first-trimester abortions guaranteed by the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.\u00a0Texas reproductive clinics are asking the justices to keep their facilities open in the face of the state restriction. Activists on both sides of the issue are expected to rally outside the court when the ruling is announced. A 4-4 tie would sustain the lower court's ruling, meaning a default victory for Texas, and likely for similar laws in other nearby states, including Louisiana and Mississippi. But no legal precedent would be established, leaving continued uncertainty nationwide. The Supreme Court could later hear new arguments in the case, when a ninth justice has been sworn in to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Tied rulings are becoming common for the post-Scalia court. The justices last week ruled 4-4 on a closely watched immigration case, dealing a setback to President Obama's executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. Scalia, who died in February, was perhaps the most outspoken of the current justices in regards to the abortion issue. A year ago, he, along with three other conservative members of the court, opposed issuing an order delaying enforcement of the Texas law while the case was being appealed. The four liberal justices -- along with swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy -- gave a temporary victory to the clinics in that case, allowing them to remain fully operational. It suggests there may now be five votes to ultimately strike down the Texas restrictions. The oral arguments from March were especially tense, though. Kennedy asked tough questions of both sides and did not tip his hand on how he would ultimately vote. If upheld, all clinics performing the abortion procedure in the state must operate as certified \"ambulatory surgical centers\" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority legislature have said the regulations contained in the 2013 law -- known as H.B. 2 -- would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups counter that the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. Only nine or 10 such health centers would qualify to stay open, and large areas west and south of San Antonio would have no full-time abortion providers. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. A federal judge initially concluded the \"ambulatory surgical centers\" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. But a federal appeal court ruled largely in favor of Texas. The clinics then asked the justices to finally decide the matter. \"There was a lot of talk at arguments about what impact this has on clinics,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department officials in the George W. Bush administration, now a private appellate attorney. \"So it could be the court is working behind the scenes to fashion some sort of compromise resolution where they basically punt, at least for the time being on the constitutional issue, and send the case back for more evidence gathering\" by the lower courts. But some court watchers on the progressive side worry what a tie vote would mean in the short term. \"It will definitely be a dramatic example of the problems of having a mere eight-justice court,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"And if the court splits 4-4 they will leave in place a difference of opinion, in the circuits [courts] below. That means women would enjoy their fundamental rights differently based on the state in which they live and this is not how our Constitution works.\" A Fox News poll from August revealed an even public split on the abortion issue, which has inevitably become enmeshed in presidential election-year politics. Among registered voters, 47 percent surveyed favor abortion rights or consider themselves \"pro-choice\" while 46 percent oppose the procedure or are \"pro-life.\" The number of abortions is at the lowest level since the Roe v. Wade decision, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute. The number remained steady at about 1.1 million reported procedures in the year 2011, down about 25 percent since the all-time high in 1990. Since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, about 53 million legal induced abortions were performed through 2011. What the Supreme Court decides Monday could ripple across other states and in Washington. The court has not ruled substantively on the abortion issue since 1992, when the justices said any such law could not place an \"undue burden\" on women's access to abortions. The swing vote, as in previous cases, came from Kennedy. It appears inevitable his vote will again prove crucial in the Texas dispute. This appeal could effectively be set aside as a political and legal issue in 2016 if the high court is unable to muster a binding majority. By next spring, a new president, and possibly a new member of the high court would then reset the abortion debate in a post-Scalia era.",

            "article_content": "William la Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the REAL ID Act to prevent foreign nationals from fraudulently obtaining a U.S. driver's license -- by requiring that any ID issued based on unverifiable foreign documents look different in \"design or color\" from an official driver's license. That way, TSA and other law enforcement would know the ID holder might not be who they say they are. But more than a decade later, several state and local governments are openly flouting the law, issuing ID cards that are barely distinguishable from a bona fide driver's license. That means those with mere ID cards, like illegal immigrants, might be able to pass off their cards as a driver's license at the airport and elsewhere -- creating a huge gap in security. Examples include Washington, D.C., and Colorado. For card-holders in the nation's capital, a small star in the corner is the only visual cue that distinguishes a D.C. license from a mere ID card. In Colorado, the distinguishing characteristic for the ID cards is a small black band. \"If you could issue a letter grade to the way states are handling this, it would be an 'F',\" said Andrew Meehan, of the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License. From the outset, states have chafed at the new federal rules. They called the policy an unfunded mandate and federal intrusion. More recently, advocates for illegal immigrants have opposed the parts of the law that require \"noncompliant\" cards for undocumented workers to look different than licenses for U.S. citizens and legal residents. \"What we object to is states that gratuitously would try to do much more than necessary for the sole purpose of stigmatizing individuals,\" said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Jon Blazer. \"On the other hand, some states have taken a better approach in this regard, and have put the minimal requirements that they're obliged to put under federal law.\" Meehan said 23 states currently meet Department of Homeland Security standards. However, six of those states issue ID cards that look virtually identical to a standard driver's license, violating the act's language. Since January alone, one of those states -- California -- has issued licenses to 500,000 illegal immigrants. \"In California they are accepting hundreds of documents issued by foreign governments,\" Meehan said. \"They are very difficult to verify.\" Other than the words, \"federal limits apply,\" the California license and ID are identical. Compare those to Illinois, which uses different colors in the two sets of IDs, and Utah, which uses a different design entirely. North Carolina proposed using a bright pink banner to distinguish a license from one issued to illegal immigrant children given lawful status, but it backed down. \"North Carolina proposed to put a hot pink color on the licenses of young immigrants sometimes known as 'dreamers' and one could not really understand any legitimate reason for doing that other than to stigmatize and give them a scarlet letter,\" Blazer complained. In passing Real ID, Congress said the law was about security, not about stigmas. Indeed, three 9/11 hijackers had obtained state IDs using fraudulent documents. One had four IDs from two states. Among them, the 33 hijackers had 33 state driver's licenses. The law is meant to set the standards for states issuing licenses, and the types of acceptable source documents. If unverifiable documents are used, that's when the ID cards are supposed to look different from regular licenses. Meehan says states do not have the resources to verify the accuracy of source documents from foreign countries. Blazer, though, says they do. Typically, states accept one of three forms of ID from Mexico: A passport, a Mexican elections card or a Matricula Consular card, which reports show can be obtained without a verifiable source document. Verification problems have fueled changes at the state level. In 2011, Utah issued 'Marcelo Marquez' a state driver's privilege card. At the time, getting the card required multiple identifying documents, but no fingerprints or photo. It turned out the source documents were fakes. Marquez was really Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, deported twice for violent crimes and drug dealing. Bracamonte used the Utah ID to get around the country until last year, when he killed two California deputies after a car chase. Utah now requires fingerprints for non-residents and changed the look of its ID cards to distinguish them from a license.",

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream reports from Washington, D.C. Fifteen minutes was all it took to show why Justice Anthony Kennedy remains a power on the U.S. Supreme Court when he provided decisive double-play votes last week, Sitting with his seven colleagues on the bench last Thursday, the senior associate justice was finishing reading a portion of his key ruling to keep in place the University of Texas' admission criteria, which takes race into account as one of many factors to ensure a diverse campus. \"It remains an enduring challenge to our nation's education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity,\u201d concluded Kennedy in his low-key clipped voice. Then just before the public session was over, another bombshell: the court dealt a setback to President Obama's unilateral executive action on immigration. The 4-4 ruling, where Kennedy this time backed his right-leaning colleagues, was a victory for states and the GOP Congress that opposed the administration's plan to shield millions of undocumented aliens from possible deportation. Four days later, on the last public session before the summer recess, the final dramatic act: the court by a 5-3 vote struck down a Texas law imposing tough regulations on clinics performing abortions. Kennedy, pivoting again to the left, was the deciding factor to conclude the regulations placed an \"undue burden\" on women seeking access to the medical procedure, affirming earlier precedent that Kennedy himself helped establish. Now more than ever, the court's unapologetic \"swing vote\" is quietly flexing his judicial power on a dizzying mix of hot-button cases. That has been particularly true since his friend and conservative colleague Antonin Scalia passed away in February, leaving the court short-handed for the foreseeable future. Republicans in the Senate have vowed not to confirm Obama's nominee-- Judge Merrick Garland-- leaving the possibility the seat will remain unfilled until next year, when the next President would choose It has left a strategic void that makes Kennedy's unique jurisprudence that much more coveted among his colleagues. Amid uncertainty, he quietly thrives. Do the math: the four reliable liberals and three reliable conservatives now orbit around Kennedy's moderate-conservative credentials, knowing he almost inevitably will provide the crucial deciding vote.\u00a0 While the justice mostly holds to the right, he can move comfortably away when he sees fit. \"The basic principle is, it is Justice Kennedy's world and you just live in it,\" said Thomas Goldstein, a private appellate attorney and creator of scotusblog.com. \"On a court of nine members there almost has to be someone in the middle by definition.\u00a0 His job where he sits on this court is to cast the deciding vote sometimes.\" ___________ After the recent abortion and affirmative action decisions, many political conservatives are now lamenting that Kennedy, who turns 80 this month,\u201d may be a \u201clost cause,\u201d since he had previously sided with the right to a large extent on these issues. The fear on the right is that with the election of a Democratic president, Scalia's replacement would be poised to establish a solid five-vote liberal majority, breaking a quarter-century or more lock held by the right. In order to preserve his crucial role, some legal experts think Kennedy may be setting the groundwork to go left and stay there, hoping to lead that bloc in his final years on the bench. \"Increasingly we are seeing him swinging to the left more and more, this has been really evident in the last few terms where we have seen liberals get historic victories,\" in cases including same-sex marriage, said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network. She told Fox News that despite a reputation as defending states\u2019 rights over federal control. \"I think we see increasingly Justice Kennedy is willing to abandon some those core principles of the constitutional system when it comes to achieving liberal policy goals, and that is discouraging to see.\" But other court watchers-- especially those who know him personally-- think Kennedy will continue to be Kennedy: unpredictably influential and invested on both sides. Many associates deny he is agenda- or legacy-driven. The justice has crafted a powerful, if hard to define, judicial power base-- seemingly in the forefront of every major ruling during his tenure. He was the key behind-the-scenes architect of the 2000 Bush v. Gore drama, a 1992 opinion upholding abortion rights, and perhaps his crowning achievement, last year's decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Kennedy's \"Greatest Hits\" as the key author or swing vote on the high court could fill multiple volumes. He has written majority decisions on campaign spending laws, underage killers, and foreign fighters held by the U-S military in the war on terror. And along with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the two native westerners carved out a jumpy place in the center, before she stepped down a decade ago. Less driven by practical concerns than O'Connor, Kennedy has striven for a loftier sense of the law's impact on society, such as a 1992 opinion affirming Roe v. Wade, but allowing for \"reasonable\" state restrictions: \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\" That earned him nicknames inside and out of the court: Flipper, Errant Voyager, Man in the Muddle. Kennedy's complex, some say unique, views on the law leave little room for consensus among his supporters and detractors. His rulings have been described as both inspired and grandiloquent. \"Justice Kennedy is a man who really doesn't know his own mind,\" said Douglas Kmiec, a former Justice Department lawyer who helped formally vet Kennedy to the high court in 1987. \"And that's not meant entirely as a criticism, because the positive way to say that is: he's open-minded.\" \"He has not been a justice to look at overarching principles, one rule that settles every case,\" said Orin Kerr, his law clerk from 2003. \"His decisions are considered unpredictable because he's not always going to rule in favor of the government, he's not always going in favor of a defendant. He's going to look case by case and that makes his decisions distinctive.\" He has generally supported his conservative colleagues on issues of crime, the death penalty, federalism, and civil rights. But also has backed the left on abortion, homosexual rights, and school prayer. \"These labels have meaning only relative to the other justices, so it has turned out Justice Kennedy has been in the middle of the court, pretty much since his appointment,\" said Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, his law clerk from 2001. \"His judicial philosophy didn't necessarily create a clean answer to every case, so he would have to think them through case by case.\" And a judicial confidence in the California native's own role, and that of the court he has shaped, has long been evident. Judges, he once said, have power and duty to \"impose order on a disordered reality.\" As for Kennedy himself, \"sometimes people think compromise means squishy, centrist,\" he has said. \"It doesn't.\"",

            "article_content": "FILE - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump points at Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as he speaks during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) Republicans have been divided as never before in this election. Some might have wished for a better candidate. Others, who liked the candidate better, might have wished for a better Party. But with only a few days left before the election it\u2019s time for all sides to unite to defeat the Democrats, at the top, middle and bottom of the ballot. It\u2019s time to put aside our differences, elect Trump, and defeat a candidate under an FBI investigation. In America\u2019s government of strong presidentialism, it\u2019s the candidate at the top who matters, and a vote for Trump is the only feasible method of defending the principles of freedom, justice and prosperity Republicans hold in common against the most serious threat we have ever faced, a threat that begins to look like the final defeat of republican government, and permanent decline for the country we love. That\u2019s why 130 respected Republicans thought-leaders have signed a second letter explaining why we support Donald Trump and urging Party unity, at scholarsandwritersforamerica.org. This is the most consequential electoral choice we\u2019ll have in our lifetime. Under Obama we have departed from the Founders\u2019 constitution of separation of powers towards one-man rule by the president. With Mrs. Clinton, we\u2019d see an even greater slide towards an all-powerful presidency, by an imperious person who holds subordinates in contempt and who labels Republicans as enemies and \u201cdeplorables.\u201d She doesn\u2019t have a legislative agenda. She has a regulatory and Supreme Court agenda, and the justices she would appoint could be expected to bless one-person rule by the president. That\u2019s why George Mason called this an \u201celective monarchy,\u201d which he said would be worse than George III. By contrast, Donald Trump has a legislative agenda. The person who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d can be expected to reach across to Congress to enact the sound legislation he proposed in his speech in Gettysburg. He has pledged to appoint judges in the mold of Justice Scalia, judges who would strike down the diktats of a president who ignores Congress as Obama did in his Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program. That program would have legalized 5 million undocumented aliens, and the Supreme Court split 4-4 on it. We know how a future Court would rule, with a new member appointed by Mrs. Clinton. And she\u2019s already told us of her plans to regularize millions of undocumented aliens by executive fiat. Absolute power corrupts, said Lord Acton. Were Mrs. Clinton elected, she\u2019d have the near absolute power of the American presidency. But she wouldn\u2019t need that to become corrupt. She\u2019s there already. Consider, then, what would happen were the \u201cClinton Cash\u201d machine to move into the White House. We\u2019d have a government with the morals of a banana republic; and crony capitalism, the silent killer of the American economy, would increasingly burden entrepreneurs. Wasteful regulations, drafted to benefit the clients of K Street lobbyists, would transfer wealth from dispersed lower and middle-class Americans to the rich and well-connected. The courtier class of Clinton donors would flourish, but woe to those who would fail to partner with the government. It might not be a kleptocracy, but it would be a huge move in that direction. Worse still, all the powers of the state would be unleashed against political enemies, with tax audits, EPA investigations, and charges brought under one of the numberless and technical federal public welfare offences. Montesquieu defined political liberty as the \u201ctranquility of spirit which comes from the opinion each one has of his security,\u201d and a Clinton administration would see to it that its political opponents would never know such tranquility. We saw a bit of this during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, and (whatever else might be said about him) he didn\u2019t have a mean bone in his body. With Mrs. Clinton it would be far worse. She is a very different sort of person from her spouse, and much more closely resembles a Richard Nixon, a Nixon without his accomplishments and with a fawning media that could be relied upon to defend her when it counted, as well as a corrupt administration that would back her to the hilt. And Donald Trump? He\u2019s an American archetype, a Sam Slick who seemingly has taken every legal advantage offered by the Tax and Bankruptcy Codes. And you expected something better from a New York City businessman? But having used all the advantages the law afforded him, he now proposes to curb them, with a Tax Code that would close off the loopholes and with important lobbying reforms that would end the corrupt revolving door between Congress and K Street. This is the most consequential electoral choice we\u2019ll have in our lifetime. Whatever differences might have had during the last twelve months, all Republicans must now unite behind the entire Republican ticket.",

            "article_content": "Jim Steinle testifies at Senate hearing The father of the young woman killed earlier this month along a San Francisco pier on Tuesday blasted the \"legal loopholes\" that allowed the illegal immigrant suspected of pulling the trigger to be released despite a rap sheet that included seven felonies and five past deportations. In dramatic Capitol Hill testimony, Jim Steinle and other relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants called on Congress to pass new laws aimed at keeping illegal immigrant criminals off the streets. \"It's unbelievable to see so many innocent Americans that have been killed by undocumented immigrant felons in recent years,\" Steinle said. His daughter, Kathryn Steinle, 32, was killed July 1, allegedly by Mexican illegal immigrant Francisco Sanchez. The case has re-ignited a national debate over immigration enforcement at the federal level and sanctuary city policies at the local level. Sanchez had been turned over to San Francisco by federal officials in March on a decades-old drug warrant, but was released by the sheriff's office the next month. Federal immigration officials, who asked to be notified of his release, were never informed. Steinle recalled his daughter's spirit and personality in brief but powerful remarks. She loved to travel, he said, and had a \"smile that would light up a room.\" She had traveled to Spain, Thailand, South Africa and beyond. He recalled how he was walking alongside her on the San Francisco pier July 1, when, \"suddenly, a shot rang out.\" \"Kate fell, and looked at me and said 'help me, Dad',\" her father recalled. They were the last words he heard from her. \"Everywhere Kate went throughout the world, she shined the light of a good citizen of the United States of America,\" he testified. \"Unfortunately, due to disjointed laws and basic incompetence at many levels, the U.S. has suffered a self-inflicted wound in the murder of our daughter by the hand of a person who should have never been on the streets of this country.\" Several lawmakers have introduced legislation in the wake of Kate Steinle's murder, aimed at tightening immigration enforcement.\u00a0Her father said that if new legislation helps prevent more killings, \"Kate's death won't be in vain.\" Though Steinle's death has renewed the debate over immigration enforcement, she was one of many Americans killed in recent years by illegal immigrants. In emotional testimony, Susan Oliver, whose husband Danny Oliver was killed last year, urged lawmakers to put policies in place so criminal immigrants can't commit more crimes. Danny Oliver was a Sacramento sheriff's deputy, but was killed in a motel parking lot by an illegal immigrant with a criminal background. \"Not a day has gone by where this has not affected me,\" Susan Oliver testified, choking up at times during her remarks. \"... I don't think I will ever get past that day.\" They testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Panel Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the Obama administration has \"completely failed to do anything about sanctuary cities.\" During the second part of the hearing, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana faced tough questioning from lawmakers -- who like Grassley suggested ICE has not gone far enough to crack down on sanctuary cities. Saldana said she was \"greatly moved\" by the testimony earlier in the hearing and said to them, \"I'm so sorry.\" But she said there's some \"solace\" in bringing perpetrators to justice, as she underscored the importance of seeking the removal of convicted criminal aliens. San Francisco is among dozens of cities with so-called sanctuary policies restricting the coordination between local and federal immigration officials. In San Francisco, however, the sheriff's department went a step further with a directive in March telling deputies not to inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement about detainees' release details. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., faulted this policy at Tuesday's hearing, noting the city never notified the feds about Sanchez. \"A simple phone call would have been enough. But that did not happen,\" she said.",

A recent New York Times headline: \u201cPeter Thiel Defends His Most Contrarian Move Yet: Supporting Trump.\u201d Isn\u2019t it time people started defending their support for Hillary Clinton? Why aren\u2019t Hillary\u2019s backers made to explain how they can vote for a candidate who promised not to trade access for money while she served as Secretary of State, but then did it anyway? Who vowed to reveal all monies collected by the Clinton Foundation from foreign entities while she was in office but failed to do so? AN \"AVALANCHE OF EVIDENCE\" MAY NOW BURY HILLARY Who has lied innumerable times to the American people and who has time and again revealed herself as lacking a moral compass? Whose campaign has engaged in dirty tricks, colluding with the DNC and with the media? Shouldn\u2019t we question those who are putting their money behind Hilary Clinton, the first person to run for the presidency while subject of a criminal investigation? Whose natural instincts are to lie, about matters serious and inconsequential? Whose greed outweighs incandescent ambition? Who offers voters nothing but enraged disparagement of her opponent? It\u2019s a reasonable question that should be asked: how can anyone with good conscience vote for Hillary Clinton? Thiel, the successful founder of PayPal, sinned against the liberal establishment by donating $1.25 million to the Trump campaign. He has come under withering criticism from Silicon Valley elites, followed by \u201cdemands that Facebook drop him from its board of directors and that Silicon Valley\u2019s leading start-up incubator, Y Combinator, sever ties with him.\u201d This, for supporting the standard-bearer of one of America\u2019s main political parties; a candidate who has a real shot at winning. The shunning comes from those accusing Thiel of condoning \u201cracism and intolerance\u201d, says the Times, an organization that seems to being doing its best to further such associations. Indeed, the liberal media, exposed through numerous leaked emails as colluding with the Hillary Clinton campaign, has done a terrific job of turning Trump backers into pariahs. But shouldn\u2019t we question those who are putting their money behind Hilary Clinton, the first person to run for the presidency while subject of a criminal investigation? Whose natural instincts are to lie, about matters serious and inconsequential? Whose greed outweighs incandescent ambition? Despite decades of scandal, Wall Street tycoons and Hollywood eminences gather to promote the Good Ship Hillary, happy to sail with the progressive tides. Even as cranky investigators expose icebergs in their path. And no one calls them to account. Many take solace in following President Obama, who has not stinted in his efforts to elect Clinton. Obama, who remains popular with those who absolve him of his lies about the Iran deal, ObamaCare, Benghazi, and now about his professed ignorance of the Clinton private server, is out campaigning for Hillary, whom he has repeatedly called \u201cthe most qualified candidate in history.\u201d He does not call her the most trustworthy, or the most genuine, or respectable or moral; the man is not a total idiot. He describes her as tough and says she has tenacity. That we know. Obama isn\u2019t campaigning for Hillary Clinton because he likes her; he\u2019s out there hustling for votes because if Donald Trump is elected, Obama\u2019s cherished legacy will melt away faster than ice cream in August. ObamaCare? Gone. Amnesty for undocumented immigrants? Gone. Overreaching EPA rules that will set our power costs soaring? Done for. The Iran deal? Well, chances are that collapses regardless of who succeeds him. Obama knows that Hillary is the protector of the status quo and of his legacy. He also knows she cannot be trusted. When she joined his cabinet, Hillary was required to sign an agreement aimed at minimizing her pay-to-play opportunities while she served at the State Department. She vowed that she would not personally participate in any matter that could impact the finances of the Clinton Foundation or the earnings of her husband, Bill. In a separate agreement, she agreed to reveal all foreign donations to the foundation. We know she broke these promises. In just one of many such examples, after Hillary intervened to solve a tax problem for Swiss banking giant UBS (an unusual gig for Secretary of State), the bank paid husband Bill $1.5 million in speaking fees and donated generously to the foundation. Even more alarming, there were\u00a01,100 foreign donations funneled through the Clinton Foundation\u2019s Canadian affiliate that were received while Clinton was in office\u00a0but never reported. Clinton\u2019s memorandum of understanding with the Obama White House specifies that the \u201cClinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative\u201d (the Canadian branch) is part of the Clinton Foundation and must follow \u201cthe same protocols.\u201d It did not. The estimated net worth of Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2006 was $34 million. In 2015, it was $111 million. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hillary did not rack up such wealth. After all, during her four years as Secretary of State her salary was only $186,000. Filings suggest her net worth in 2006 was about $30 million; in 2015, it was nearly unchanged at $31 million.\u00a0 In 2006 Bill\u2019s wealth was about $4 million; by 2015 that had soared to $80 million. Note that during those years the U.S. financial markets endured one of the worst downdrafts ever, which lopped off a sizeable slug of the country\u2019s wealth. By 2015 financial markets had recovered, but it is safe to conclude that Bill Clinton\u2019s good fortune did not come by way of investment returns. No, Bill made a fortune giving speeches, often to groups also funding the Clinton Foundation, and who had business before the U.S. government. It was a seamy arrangement \u2013 seamy enough to apparently invite scrutiny from FBI agents who were then blocked from pursuing an investigation. Donald Trump is no Boy Scout. His business history is checkered and his personal manner is off-putting. But, the portrayal of him as racist and dangerous has been overblown by Hillary\u2019s team, because they have nothing else to talk about. Hillary fears the appeal of a fresh-start candidate, and especially one who is willing to challenge the status quo and push back at the politically correct idiocy ensnaring our national discourse. Trump is offering voters a real choice, which doesn\u2019t happen often. President Obama campaigned on hope and change, but delivered neither. It is possible \u2013 likely, even \u2013 that it will take an outsider to shift the direction of the country, to upend the corrupt politics of Washington, to stem the unbridled expansion of the federal government and return power to the people, which most Americans seem to want. That outsider, in this cycle, is Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to an exclusive poll released Thursday, a signal that despite years of recovery from the Great Recession, Americans' financial conditions remains precarious as ever. These financial difficulties span all income levels, according to the poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Seventy-five percent of people in households making less than $50,000 a year would have difficulty coming up with $1,000 to cover an unexpected bill. But when income rose to between $50,000 and $100,000, the difficulty decreased only modestly to 67 percent. Even for the country's wealthiest 20 percent \u2014 households making more than $100,000 a year \u2014 38 percent say they would have at least some difficulty coming up with $1,000. \"The more we learn about the balance sheets of Americans, it becomes quite alarming,\" said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute focusing on poverty and emergency savings issues. Harry Spangle is one of those Americans. A 66-year-old former electrician from New Jersey, Spangle said he thought he would always have a job and \"lived for today\" but lost his job before the downturn. He said he would have to borrow from friends or family in order to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense. \"I have a pension and I am on Social Security, but it's very limiting,\" he said. \"It's depressing.\" Having a modest, immediately available emergency fund is widely recognized as critical to financial health. Families that have even a small amount of non-retirement savings, between $250 and $749, are less likely to be evicted from their homes and less likely to need public benefits, an Urban Institute study found. \"People are extremely vulnerable if they don't have savings,\" Ratcliffe said. \"And it's a cost to taxpayers as well. Lack of savings can lead to homelessness, or other problems.\" Despite an absence of savings, two-thirds of Americans said they feel positive about their finances , according to survey data released Wednesday by AP-NORC, a sign that they're managing day-to-day expenses fine. The challenge for many often come from economic forces beyond their control such as a dip in the stock market that threatens their job or an unexpected medical bill, risks that have shattered the confidence of most in the broader U.S. economy. Yet when faced with an unexpected $1,000 bill, a majority of Americans said they wouldn't be especially likely to pay with money on hand, the AP-NORC survey found. A third said they would have to borrow from a bank or from friends and family, or put the bill on a credit card. Thirteen percent would skip paying other bills, and 11 percent said they would likely not pay the bill at all. Those numbers suggest that most American families do not have at least $1,000 stashed away in an accessible savings account, much less under their mattresses, to cover an emergency. Americans' struggle to save isn't new. Three CBS News and The New York Times polls going back to the mid-1990s \u2014 the most recent one done in 2007 before the downturn \u2014 show a majority of Americans would have some difficulty covering a $1,000 emergency. The AP-NORC results also correlate with a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve in which 47 percent of respondents said they either could not cover a $400 emergency expense or would have to sell something or borrow money. And the struggle impacts retirement savings as well. When AP-NORC asked if they will have enough savings to retire when they want to, 54 percent of working Americans say they are not very or not at all confident they will have enough. Only 14 percent say they are confident they can retire on time. The findings in the AP-NORC poll illuminate how many Americans' frustrations over the economy, income inequality and insecurity about their financial futures has contributed to this dizzying presidential election season. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party largely on a populist platform of kicking out undocumented immigrants, renegotiating free trade agreements and a promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" On the left, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont captured voters with a message of dismantling Wall Street and higher taxes on the rich. The reasons why Americans don't save are complex. One economist says it's a holdover from the '70s and '80s, when high inflation ate into the value of money stashed in a savings account. Others say U.S. tax policy rewards saving money for retirement or taking out a mortgage to buy a home over short-term emergencies. The Great Recession and lack of wage growth in recent years have not helped. In the same AP-NORC poll, 46 percent of workers said their wages have remained stagnant in the last five years, and another 16 percent said they've actually seen salary cuts. Meanwhile, costs for basic needs, such as food, housing and health care, have risen. \"The lack of (savings) is symptomatic to other financial problems that families are having,\" said William R. Emmons, a senior economic adviser at the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Many families are still struggling with debt from the housing bubble and borrowing boom. And the recent economic stresses make it much more likely families are going to be fighting basic financial issues.\" Mitchell Timme, 26, said that his wages have remained basically flat for the last few years while his cost of living has increased. Once everything is paid \"there's nothing left to save,\" he said. \"It definitely adds stress to everyday life. It hangs over you. While it's not something you would complain about every day, it's there. And it weighs on you,\" Timme said, who works at a security company in Phoenix. It may not be entirely bad that some Americans do not have much cash savings, Emmons said. In the poll, 21 percent of Americans say they would strongly consider the option of putting the unexpected $1,000 bill on a credit card to be paid in full when their statement came due. \"For financially stronger families, having access to low-cost credit is completely acceptable,\" he said. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,008 adults was conducted April 14-18 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.

I said we could fix it.\u201d \u2013President Obama at a Beverly Hills fundraiser discussing the mass murder at a Charleston, S.C. church.The only really clear mandate after President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election was to not be Mitt Romney. Obama had won more in spite of his policies than because of them, but had successfully convinced voters that Romney was too risky a pick. After the grindingest grind of an election in presidential political history, Obama had won another term of what, exactly? Endless battles with the GOP House on taxes and spending? Foreign policy headaches? More scorched earth fights protecting ObamaCare? Blech. But at that very moment, a meteor crashed into American public life: The senseless slaughter of 20 children and six educators at a Connecticut elementary school less than two weeks before Christmas. A fatherless, mentally ill 20-year-old had killed his mother, stolen her guns and laid waste to a group of students at a nearby school, all aged 6 and 7. Obama wept in private and shed tears in public, as most parents must have. He also found new purpose for the second term of his presidency. Two days after the murders, Obama would make a mighty vow: \u201cIn the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens \u2026 in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.\u201d As an orthodox liberal, Obama had always been a proponent of gun control. But it had hardly been a top-drawer concern. For example, when a gunman killed 13 people at an immigration center in Binghamton, N.Y. in April of 2009, Obama called it \u201csenseless violence,\u201d but did not demand that the Democratic-controlled Congress push through gun control. The Connecticut killings, different in nature and coming as they did when Obama was looking to do more than just defend his legacy, spurred him headlong into the divided Congress with demands for the most sweeping gun control legislation since the Clinton era. Even though the legislation wouldn\u2019t have prevented the shooting had it been in place, gun violence became the animating issue for the Democratic Party. The legislation was cued up and public pressure was enormous. The daily shouts from television, social media and elsewhere were for action, action, action. But before too long, Democrats lost their nerve. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ended up killing even a compromise package that would have required background checks at gun shows and for private sales. All the thunder came to naught. And here we are again. This time it is nine Christians at worship at a historic church in Charleston, S.C. The place that once heard the exultant cries of freed slaves heard the anguished ones of murder victims. It would be wholly unfair to say that the legislation proposed by the president would have in any way prevented the killings. But one wonders why a party and a president who believed that more gun regulations would save lives gave up so easily.

            "article_content": "Reaction from Remi Spencer, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor It will again fuel the speculation. The wonder. The whispers. The conjecture may not be fair. But it will inevitably happen. A decision by Washington D.C. Superior Court Judge Robert Morin to \u201cdismiss without prejudice\u201d the murder conviction of Ingmar Guandique is likely to foster enduring chatter theory, which hasn\u2019t dissipated in the nation\u2019s capital in 15 years. In 2010, the feds convicted Guandique -- an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador -- in the murder of then 24-year-old Washington intern Chandra Levy nine years earlier. Now prosecutors appealed to the court to drop the conviction as the court prepared for a retrial this fall because their case against Guandique crumbled. The U.S. Attorney told the court that his office \u201ccould no longer prove the murder case against Mr. Guandique beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Prosecutors based their conviction on the testimony of what later proved to be an unreliable informant who coughed up information from the slammer. Prosecutors halted their efforts against Guandique following the revelation of an illegally-taped conversation between gang leader Armando Morales and bit-part actress Babs Proller. Morales\u2019s information was key in the conviction of Guandique. Morales and Proller got to know each other when they were neighbors. Proller\u2019s recording purportedly reveals he lied on the witness stand during Guandique\u2019s 2010 trial, which earned him a 60-year sentence for murdering Levy. \" 'Homeboy, I killed that bitch, but I didn\u2019t rape her,\u2019 \u201d Morales testified\u00a0in court about what Guandique told him about Levy. Morales asked for installation in the government\u2019s witness protection program for his testimony. \u201cIt is now clear that the jailhouse informant, who was central to the government case, was a perjurer who too easily manipulated the prosecutors,\u201d said Guandique\u2019s attorneys. And so, the question today is the same as it was 15 years ago: Who killed Chandra Levy? The disappearance and murder of Levy has and always will be a Capitol Hill story. That\u2019s because at the time of Levy\u2019s death, she was having an affair with then-Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif. Carnival atmospheres frequently descend on Capitol Hill: Donald Trump meeting with House and Senate Republicans as he did a few weeks ago. A lineup of baseball stars like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa appearing at a hearing on doping. Bono and Alicia Keys cruising through the Capitol\u2019s marble corridors in an effort to secure funding for AIDS research. But no one has seen a journalism jamboree like the one that unfolded around Condit in the spring and summer of 2001. The Levy case engrossed the entire press corps. News crews from around the world encamped on the Capitol. Reporters staked out Condit\u2019s office. They stalked him near the House gym in the Rayburn House Office Building. They pursued him in and out at the House Agriculture Committee. They waited at all hours for Condit at his home in Washington\u2019s Adams-Morgan neighborhood. They even hung out in front of the home of his chief of staff in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va. There were no suspects in the Levy case. But Condit was eerily mute. His quiet fomented disquiet. What did he know? What did he do? Did he do anything? Prosecutors called Condit to testify in the 2010 Guandique case. When Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Haines presented Condit in court, she noted that the former congressman \u201cwas having an affair with Chandra Levy.\u201d She later said those rendezvous had \u201cnothing to do with the murder of Chandra Levy.\u201d But earlier this year, Guandique\u2019s defense team planned to introduce evidence at a retrial that could implicate Condit. \u201cCondit was fully aware of the cost he could pay if his affair with Ms. Levy became public,\u201d said the defense in court filings. \u201cHe therefore had an obvious motive to kill Ms. Levy in order to keep the relationship secret, and an equally powerful motive to cover up the circumstances of her death if she died while she was with him -- either through intentional conduct or otherwise.\u201d Back in 2001, all eyes -- including those of media and law enforcement -- focused on Condit. The case baffled investigators. There was no murder weapon. They found no body (until 2002). No obvious motive. There was cryptic information from Levy\u2019s computer internet searches about the Pierce-Klingle Mansion in the middle of Washington\u2019s Rock Creek Park. In May, 2002, a man searching for turtles (can this get any weirder?) stumbled upon Levy\u2019s skeletal remains. Notably on Levy\u2019s computer, there was also a search for Baskin-Robbins. After leaving Congress, Condit operated two Baskin-Robbins franchises near Phoenix. Baskin-Robbins later sued Condit and his family for failing to pay franchise and advertising fees to the company. Police eventually ruled Condit out as a suspect. He conceded in an interview he had a tryst with a woman who was nearly three decades his junior. But authorities cleared Condit, despite finding him elusive. Flight attendant Anne Marie Smith also came forward, saying she too had an affair with Condit. The congressman then refused to submit to a police polygraph. Is there any reason this story wouldn\u2019t consume media, in Washington or elsewhere? Condit tried to run for re-election. He lost his primary to a former staffer, Rep. Dennis Cardoza, D-Calif. Condit\u2019s son Chad ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2012. Guandique turned to Levy\u2019s parents when he appeared in court six years ago. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for what happened to your daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had nothing to do with it. I am innocent.\u201d And still, no one knows who did it. But one thing is clear: the recording Babs Proller made of Armando Morales is the lynchpin to clearing Guandique. That\u2019s the only reason people in Washington are chattering about this case again. In a final, warped twist, Babs Proller appeared briefly in an episode of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d In a non-speaking role, Proller appears sitting on the dais in the House chamber when President Frank Underwood addresses Congress for his State of the Union message. Proller\u2019s position in the chamber is usually reserved for the clerk of the House during such elite meetings. The entire Chandra Levy case revolves around quintessential Washington intrigue, even 15 years down the road. A congressman\u2019s liaisons with an intern. Power. An unsolved murder. A media circus. All inside the Beltway touchstones worthy of the program, \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d It appears the government formed its case against Guandique on a house of cards. And perhaps it\u2019s only appropriate that an actress who appeared on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d helped immolate the prosecution and the conviction of Guandique. Who killed Chandra Levy? Well, it\u2019s like something right out of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d",

First reported by the NYT, the cashiering of the Pentagon boss comes after \u201cthe two men mutually agreed\u201d that it was time for the highest profile Republican in Obama\u2019s cabinet to go. But given the fact that the White House was the one pushing out the story, it seems more likely that the president had grown tired of the ongoing pressure from Hagel and members of the top brass to take a more aggressive stance on national security threats abroad. The conflict went public back in August when Hagel openly contradicted White House talking points on the threat posed by Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria. While Obama succumbed to the pressure, Hagel\u2019s ouster shows the president seeking to reassert control over his foundering foreign policy. [Who will replace? - NYT: \u201cAt the top of the list are Michele Flournoy, the former undersecretary of defense; Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and a former officer with the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne; and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of defense.\u201d]Fault finding - Democrats blame disaffection among base voters for the party\u2019s historic defeat earlier this month. And, to be sure, there has not been much for liberals to cheer in Obama\u2019s foreign policy of late. Not only has the president begrudgingly escalated the war against Islamists, the administration has quietly accepted defeat in the president\u2019s bid to get all fighting forces out of Afghanistan. The \u201cendless war\u201d foreign policy combined with stunning revelations about Obama\u2019s expansion of domestic surveillance sent the president\u2019s approval ratings on national security \u2013 once stratospheric after the killing of Usama bin Laden \u2013 to a series of new lows. And among no group was the decline more evident than with Democrats. Given the centrality of Obama\u2019s dovish foreign policy to the building of his coalition, even the reluctant, half-hearted hawkishness of 2014 might be seen as a key culprit by Democrats in the party\u2019s losses. [The good times - Obama often touted his friendship with Hagel as evidence of bipartisan bent, with the right kind of Republican.]That was then - Hagel, who became a hero to Democrats for his relentless criticism of fellow Republican President George W. Bush during the Iraq war, apparently still proved too hawkish for the president and his supporters. That Hagel\u2019s team was recently expressing confidence that he would serve through the end of the president\u2019s term suggests that this reordering came as something of a surprise. Given the harsh critiques of Obama\u2019s other top foreign policy advisers, Hagel\u2019s replacement will be a fraught business. And with the ongoing struggles of Obama\u2019s foreign policy, the debate could further divide Democrats on the most volatile issue for the party and its hawkish 2016 frontrunner.IRAN NUKE TALKS MISS DEADLINEAP: \u201cNuclear negotiators have failed to meet a Monday deadline for a deal that would ease international concerns about Iran\u2019s atomic program and are poised to extend the negotiations for a comprehensive agreement until July 2015, diplomats said. Under the terms of limited agreements reached after a frenetic six days of talks in Vienna, a political accord is to be completed by March 1, with final details contained in annexes to be sealed by July 1, the diplomats said\u2026.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said it \u2018was not possible to meet the deadline\u2019 due to wide gaps on well-known points of contention, including levels of uranium enrichment and the number of centrifuges Iran would be allowed to operate.\u201d [Jerusalem Post: \u201cIsrael has issued a stark, public warning to its allies with a clear argument: Current proposals guarantee the perpetuation of a crisis, backing Israel into a corner from which military force against Iran provides the only logical exit.\u201d]Warren in Tel Aviv with Bibi on deadline day - Jerusalem Post: \u201cWhile it is two full years before the 2016 US presidential race, the parade of possible candidates to Israel began Monday afternoon with a meeting by Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Warren, whose name has been mentioned as a possible challenger to Hillary Clinton for the democratic nomination, arrived Saturday in Tel Aviv, and will also visit Ramallah and Amman. This is the first trip abroad for the senator, elected in 2012 and who has so-far concentrated largely on US domestic issues.\u201d [Washington Free Beacon: \u201cIran\u2019s foreign minister and lead negotiator in nuclear talks is known to frequently scream and shout at Western diplomats, including Secretary of State John Kerry, a practice that has caused alarm\u00a0among bodyguards stationed outside the negotiating room, according to a member of the Iranian diplomatic\u00a0team who spoke to the\u00a0Farsi-language press.]RAND CALLS FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST ISISNYT: \u201cSenator\u00a0Rand Paul\u00a0[R-Ky.] is calling for a declaration of war against the Islamic State, a move that promises to shake up the debate over the military campaign in Iraq and Syria as\u00a0President Obama\u00a0prepares to ask Congress to grant him formal authority to use force. Mr. Paul, a likely presidential candidate who has emerged as one of the Republican Party\u2019s most cautious voices on military intervention, offered a very circumscribed definition of war in his proposal, which he outlined in an interview on Saturday. He would, for instance, limit the duration of military action to one year and significantly restrict the use of ground forces. Unlike other resolutions circulating on Capitol Hill that would give the president various degrees of authority to use force against Islamic militants, Mr. Paul would take the extra step of declaring war \u2014 something Congress has not done since World War II. The president has said he will ask Congress for the explicit authority to fight the Islamic State, though administration officials have insisted that he has the legal power to continue the current campaign.\u201dPaul strengthens McConnell ties with fundraiser hire - National Review: \u201c[Sen.] Rand Paul [R-Ky.] is bringing on [Sen.] Mitch McConnell\u2019s [R-Ky.] national finance director, Laura Sequeira, to play a key fundraising role at his political-action committee ahead of an expected 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d [Flashback: \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a very tight relationship, and I\u2019m for him\u2026I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a final decision on that. But he\u2019ll be able to count on me.\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell in a post-electioninterview.]Air freshener - NYT: \u201cRepublicans also confront a generational decision: They have several energetic governors and senators in their 40s and early 50s lining up to run. \u2026Democrats have had their share of intergenerational battles, but this is relatively new terrain for Republicans. With the exception of George W. Bush, every Republican nominee since 1976 has been over 60.\u201dPoll: No GOP frontrunner in N.H. - Among the tightly packed pool of contenders on the Republican side, a new Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm New Hampshire poll ties Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., at 16 percent each. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., follows close behind at 14 percent. The remaining potential candidates remain further behind with less than 10 percent each. When 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney is added, he jumps way ahead of the field at 30 percent. While on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton enjoys a substantial lead at 62 percent over her next closest competitor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at 13 percent.Carson gets warm welcome from Iowa evangelicals - USA Today: \u201cDr. Ben Carson, a prominent retired neurosurgeon widely mentioned as a\u00a0prospective 2016 presidential candidate, got a warm and enthusiastic reception Saturday night from a key group of Iowa Christian conservatives\u2026Carson pulled no punches in his hour-long remarks, affirming his support for traditional marriage and opposition to abortion while criticizing the Affordable Care Act and President Obama's plans to allow up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to remain in the country.\u201dIG report could dog Kasich - Mark Tapscott reports: \u201cOhio Gov. John Kasich is often mentioned as a potential 2016 Republican presidential hopeful, but there could be an unexpected roadblock for him, a new Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report said. \u2018Although Ohio took steps in recent years to improve its management of funds awarded under the Homeland Security Grant Program, [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] cannot be assured that Ohio effectively managed grant funds from fiscal years 2010 through 2012,\u2019 the IG said\u00a0in a report made public\u00a0Nov. 18, 2014.\u201d OBAMA: VOTERS WANT \u2018NEW CAR SMELL\u2019 IN CANDIDATE, BUT 22-YEAR VETERAN HILLARY WOULD BE \u2018GREAT\u2019Fox News: \u201c[President Obama] says voters want a \u2018new car smell\u2019 in the 2016 White House race and that [Hillary Clinton] would be \u2018a great president.\u2019 But would Clinton pass that particular smell test? In a nationally televised interview broadcast Sunday, Obama seemed to suggest that any Democrat other than him would provide the turn of the page that he says voters are interested in. He acknowledged the \u2018dings\u2019 to his own political standing during nearly six years of sometimes bruising battles with Congress and said Americans will want something new. \u2018They want to drive something off the lot that doesn't have as much mileage as me,\u2019 Obama said in the interview with ABC's \u2018This Week,\u2019 which was taped Friday in Las Vegas following a public appearance there by the president.\u201d [Ed. note: And she\u2019s \u201clikable enough\u201d to boot!

The Atlantic explores the birth of the delicious single servings of mozzarella that inhabit lunch boxes and bags for Americans young and old. As it turns out, there\u2019s nothing magical (or synthetic) about getting the mild mozzarella into its stringy state, just a different handling and packing process. The magazine follows the trail to \u2013 where else? \u2013 Wisconsin to discover how it all began. \u201cFrom its humble three- to five-inch length origins, Baker Cheese quickly designed a stick that was thinner, more holdable, and lighter (current string cheese clocks in at 28 grams; prehistoric string cheese was in the 40 to 45 gram range). That was in 1976. But it wasn\u2019t until the a few years later, when string cheese had become cylindrified from its original twisted rope state and retail opportunities abounded, that string cheese catapulted from a local oddity to a national craze that caught on with the younger set.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The numbers generated by that law \u2013 a little more than 140,000 \u2014 further indicate that the universe of potential applicants was much smaller than 1.5 million, especially given that the law eased restrictions even more.

Mary Landrieu, his opponent in Louisiana\u2019s hotly contested Senate runoff\u2026Obama\u2019s executive order puts Landrieu in a difficult position. It reminds voters in Louisiana, a conservative state where Obama is widely disliked, that the president and Landrieu belong to the same party. Landrieu, the underdog in the Dec. 6 runoff against Cassidy, would prefer that voters focused on other things.

            "article_content": "FILE - July 28, 2016: Khizr Khan, father of fallen US Army Capt. Humayun S. M. Khan and his wife Ghazala speak during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on the website US Defense Watch. It is reprinted with permission. Dear Mr. Khan, I, like millions of Americans saw your speech at the DNC on Thursday night. I wish to offer my sympathy for the death of your son, Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq. As a former US Army officer, and a veteran of the Gulf War, I can certainly understand the pain and anguish that you and your wife endure every day. Your son died saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. As Jesus told his disciples, according to the Gospel of John, Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Captain Khan is a hero. I am sure the soldiers he served with regard him as one. I know you and your wife do. Rest assured that millions of veterans regard your son as a hero as well. To paraphrase from the Book of Ecclesiasticus, your son\u2019s name liveth for evermore. Your son made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, a country that was new to you and your family and one which you openly embraced and certainly love. When you and your family arrived to America from Pakistan, you assimilated into our country. You adopted American ways, learned our history and apparently you even acquired a pocket Constitution along the way. Good for you sir. But, there are many Muslims in America who not only have no desire to assimilate, but wish to live under Sharia Law. That is unacceptable to Americans. There is only one law of the land. That is the U.S. Constitution. As you well know, Mr. Khan, we live in violent times, dangerous times. Muslim madmen from ISIS and other radical Jihadi groups are on a murder and terror spree across the globe. Your religion of peace, Islam, is anything but that in 2016. That is a fact that is confirmed every time a Muslim shoots, bombs, beheads and tortures innocent men, women and children. This does not mean that every Muslim is a terrorist, but most terrorists, sir, are indeed Muslims. A Muslim terrorist attack has become the sign of the times. Regardless of what the feckless, na\u00efve, leftist ideologue Barack Obama and his dimwitted colleagues John Kerry, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel state, the United States and the West are at war with Radical Islam. It is the job of the president of the United States to protect his nation from all enemies; foreign and domestic. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama romanticizes Islam and refuses to accept reality, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people across the world. Groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda have one goal, the complete destruction of the Judeo-Christian culture, our religions and our way of life. Many Americans have families that have been here for decades, even centuries. Many families like mine have relatives who fought in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm. Some families have relatives who fought in the American Revolution. We don\u2019t plan on letting our country be devoured by Muslim maniacs. We are Americans sir, and not unarmed, socialist European zombies. We will do what is necessary to protect the United States. While many Democrats and liberals see the world through rose colored glasses, conservatives understand that there is good and evil in this world. Evil must be destroyed before it destroys us. Strong measures, wartime measures, must be taken to protect this country from those that wish to annihilate us and our way of life. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to temporarily halt immigration from Muslim countries that are known to either support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups is not only pragmatic, but indeed it is constitutional. It is the constitutional duty of the president of the United States to protect this nation. There is simply no way to vet hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from war zones like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Europe is being destroyed because reckless leaders like Angela Merkel have opened the continent\u2019s doors to a flood of over one million undocumented Muslims arriving with nothing more than a bad attitude and a haversack of Jihad. Do you think Americans are stupid? While the left lives in a dream world, the right does not. Mr. Trump understands the threat to his nation and the threat, sir, is not from Swedish Lutherans named Anna and Lars. The threat, sir, is from radical Islam. How in God\u2019s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of a 22-year-old Syrian man? It is impossible. You know it is impossible. How in God\u2019s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and thousands of other sundry Muslims who wish to arrive on our shores? It is impossible. You know it is impossible. Whether you, your wife, the Muslim world and millions of Democrats are offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s realistic view of the world is irrelevant. Whether you, your wife and son would have been prohibited from emigrating from Pakistan to America under Mr. Trump\u2019s wartime plan is irrelevant. The security of this great land supersedes your desires and the desires of others who wish to come here now. The United States of America has no obligation to open its doors in order to placate foreigners and liberals in our government. To adopt any other course but Mr. Trump\u2019s would be a cause for further endangering the lives of Americans every day. That, sir, is unacceptable. You attacked Mr. Trump in front of a worldwide audience, yet you can\u2019t understand the fact that he defends himself against attacks from you, Hillary Clinton and the left. What else is one to do sir? We must live in a world of reality, not a world of denial, delusion and fantasy the Democrats inhabit every waking day of their lives. Radical Islam is the enemy of everyone on this planet who believes in freedom and justice. Until it is destroyed, this nation must protect itself from enemies both foreign and domestic.

CLINTON PUTS SQUEEZE ON DEMS CAMPAIGN CASHHaving celebrated Independence Day with a mobile rope line to keep the press away, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is looking to clamp down an iron fist on the purse of Democratic National Committee. \u00a0The staff behind Clinton, who has seen her poll numbers plummet on trustworthiness, has been \u201cstruggling for months to finalize a joint fundraising agreement\u201d with the DNC, Politico reports. The problem:\u00a0 Team Hillary \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust the national party structure with the money.\u201d \u201cThe Clinton campaign\u2019s chief administrative officer, Charlie Baker, is serving as the point man to start laying the groundwork for what Clinton aides expect will be an eventual takeover of the national party structure, according to sources familiar with both DNC and Clinton activity. While DNC staffers are officially neutral, most see her as the eventual nominee, and several staffers describe a \u2018first among equals\u2019 approach to her when dealing with the primary field. A joint fundraising agreement would enable events to raise the $2,700 maximum for Clinton and the $33,400 level for the DNC from the same donors\u2026.The campaign has insisted that any money raised through joint fundraising activities be put in what\u2019s essentially a lockbox until the general election campaign. The DNC wanted access to all the funds immediately.\u201dHillary uncorked? - Campaign insiders tell #mediabuzz\u201d host Howard Kurtz that Clinton has decided to make herself more available to the media and will begin doing national TV interviews in the next week. After an internal debate and realization that keeping her at arm\u2019s length from the press has damaged her campaign, \u201c\u2026a consensus has formed around the notion that allowing more routine access will drain the drama from each encounter.\u201d [Prologue - The Atlantic\u2019s David Frum contrasts the approach to the press taken by legacy candidates Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush: \u201c[W]hat we\u2019re seeing from these two leading candidates are deep personality traits that developed long before the 2016 campaign began\u2014and will continue into their presidencies, should either win the presidency.\u201d]Sanders: Clinton is the \u2018establishment\u2019 - \u201cClinton\u2026is the candidate of the Democratic establishment\u2026but I think what is equally interesting is the fact that all over this country, ordinary people, working people, elderly people are moving in our direction because they do want a candidate to take on the establishment.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on CNN.[Sanders holds a town meeting in Portland, Maine\u2019s Cross Insurance Arena.

Washington St. He has hired directors in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and has someone on deck for South Carolina. The group has accumulated about 100,000 signatures on petitions imploring Biden to make his third try for the presidency.\u201d WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Belfast-born writer Clive Staples Lewis will have one of his most famous books \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\u201d commemorated with sculptures of his notable characters including Mr. Tumnus, and the White Witch, reports the Belfast Telegraph. Set in a newly designed public square in East Belfast, the characters will be placed in strategic locations throughout that area to reflect their role in the story. Lewis\u2019 contribution to literature was more than just a fantasy story for children\u2019s imaginations, though. His main identity was as a Christian apologetics writer; a type of writing that provides reasoned basis for Christian faith. Christian symbolism bled into his children\u2019s stories, particularly in \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u201d The story is supposed to be an allegory of Christ\u2019s resurrection with Aslan the lion representing Jesus Christ. Aslan\u2019s sacrifice for Edmund after he is taken by the White Witch symbolizes the Christian belief that Christ sacrificed himself for their sins. When Aslan is resurrected the Stone Table, depicting the Mosaic Law in the story, breaks representing the end of the stricter Old Testament for the redemption seen in the New Testament of the Bible after Christ\u2019s death.

Over the weekend, Trump brought in the death of Kathryn Steinle, the young woman gunned down by an undocumented worker in San Francisco, to prove his point. But most GOP rivals baulked. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., said, \u201cTo make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., added Trump\u2019s comments were, \u201coffensive and inaccurate.\u201d There is understandable cringing within the party, but candidates like Bush and Rubio are also able to use Trump as the bogie man. While advocating secure borders, rivals can increase their appeal to Hispanic voters, pushing their own immigration policy as less extreme. Although Trump fired blistering retorts at Bush and Rubio, and his overall poll numbers are high, his rhetoric may simply result in making him increasingly an outlier and benefit his opponents. \u201cHispanics in America and Hispanics in Texas, from the Alamo to Afghanistan, have been extraordinary people, citizens of our country and of our state.\u00a0 They have served nobly.\u201d \u2013 Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, on ABC. \u201cI salute Donald Trump for focusing on [immigration]. He has a colorful way of speaking. It\u2019s not the way I speak, but I\u2019m not going to engage in the media\u2019s game of throwing rocks and attacking other Republicans. I\u2019m just not going to do it.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on NBC. How to confront the Trump - Wash Ex\u2019s David Drucker looks at how the GOP plans to weather the Trump storm in the early campaign cycle.

In the process, he has both neutralized the sort of criticism that helped tank Mitt Romney by paying the highest federal rate possible while simultaneously buying the credibility to argue for tax reform that\u2019s born of shared experience with many millions of Americans who believe they're paying the IRS too much.\u201d [Dems directed fire - The Hill tallied the DNC\u2019s social media mentions of Republican presidential contenders to see whom the group has been hitting the most over the past year: \u201c[Rand Paul] ranks as the DNC\u2019s top target, with 203 mentions. [Chris Christie] follows with 202 attacks, and Bush trails closely behind him with 199.\u201d] Rubio gets heat from NYT\u2026again - This time it\u2019s about Cuba. The NYT traveled to Cuba to talk to people about Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and how they feel about him. The answer: not good. As one person said, \u201cHe\u2019s against Cuba in every possible way. Hillary Clinton understands much more the case of Cuba. Rubio and these Republicans, they are still stuck in 1959.\u201d The piece then went into the Rubio\u2019s family history in Cuba, but Rubio said that the Cuban people\u2019s opinion is no surprise since all their media is state-controlled. Head of Iowa GOP said that Walker\u2019s lead won\u2019t last - The Hill: \u201cThe head of Iowa\u2019s Republican Party does not think Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s lead in polls there will last. Jeff Kaufmann said on Sunday that it\u2019s far too early for the Hawkeye State to have made up its mind. \u2018I don\u2019t see that gap between Gov. Walker and the rest of the candidates, I don\u2019t see that holding where it\u2019s at right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this thing is going to tighten and that it is going to continue to tighten.\u2019\u201dCruz rakes in the cash - USA Today: \u201cRepublican Ted Cruz says he\u2019s raised $14.2\u00a0million since announcing his presidential campaign in late March,\u00a0positioning himself as a formidable fundraiser in what\u2019s becoming a crowded field for the GOP nomination.

(AP) FILE: Nov. 5, 2014: President Obama at a news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, D.C. (AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

But he is plowing ahead tonight anyway. The president\u2019s strategy for unveiling his executive orders is getting much praise from supporters, particularly because it will \u201ccoincide with the Latin Grammy Awards on Univision, which will cut away to air the president\u2019s address, thus guaranteeing excellent ratings among the Spanish language audience.\u201d Obama also teased the speech in conjunction with one of his corporate backers, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, by using Zuckerberg\u2019s site and then celebrating each other\u2019s posts. It may sound more like a way to launch a new flavor of potato chips or a Nickleback single than a major shift in public policy. But by handpicking media partners who support the action, Obama can guarantee favorable coverage for target audiences and dial back some of the consequences with the nation as a whole. [Watch Fox: President Obama delivers an address on immigration at 8pm ET. Stay with Fox News for full coverage and analysis.] Same old song - After a relatively poor showing this fall among Latino voters in key races, Democrats are keen to show vigorous action on immigration. So, narrow-casting his remarks to the Latin Grammy audience and then heading to Nevada for a campaign rally Friday is a logical step. It\u2019s also exactly how Obama has dealt with prior problems: Give a speech and then hit the road to complain about \u201cWashington.\u201d And while Democrats surely hope for Republicans to catch impeachment fever or at least offer the chance to force a government shutdown, there is little reason to believe this gambit will work any better than his previous talk treks. Remember how Democrats tried to rally black voters ahead of the midterm vote with targeted, often incendiary, outreach through African-American media outlets and direct mail. This is the same approach on a larger, risker, scale. After all, word will certainly get out. \u201cIf President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress will act. We\u2019re considering a variety of options. But make no mistake. When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act.\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, in a Senate floor speech today. One mouth, two sides - The message the president would like the audience for the Latin Grammys to take away is that this is a big deal and that he is audacious and decisive. The message for the rest of the country is that this is no big deal, and just like what previous presidents of both parties have done to deal with a \u201cbroken\u201d immigration system. Despite lots of evidence to the contrary, there will be a strong effort by the president to downplay these actions as temporary, necessary and normal. But with the results of the Nov. 4 elections still fresh on Americans\u2019 minds, it will be hard for them to see this as anything but vindictive and obstinate behavior by a president who can\u2019t deal with his new political reality. [The Federalist\u2019s Gabriel Malor truth squads claims that Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration is comparable to those of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush: \u201cThey were trying to implement a complicated amnesty that Congress had already passed \u2026 Obama is clearly contravening both ordinary practice and the wishes of Congress\u2014as expressed in statute\u2014by declaring an amnesty himself.] What\u2019s in the plan, man? - The White House has not released the official details of President Obama\u2019s executive action, but there have been lots of breadcrumbs from the White House. Fox News first reported the contours of the plan to grant temporary amnesty to an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants. Since then, a steady flow of reports have offered clues to what Obama will declare: [Teepees - Buzzfeed got a glimpse at the White House\u2019s immigration talking points sent out to Democratic congressional offices.] Governors ready suits - NYT: \u201cGov.

Boehner, R-Ohio, warned of blowback. \u201cIf \u2018Emperor Obama\u2019 ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue \u2014 and many others,\u201d said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.\u201d [Boehner adviser Matt Wolking lists 22 instances in which Obama claimed to lack the lacks the power to act unilaterally.]Rand: So sue him - The Hill: \u201cSen.

Under the watchful eye of Coach Anatoli Tarasov, the nation\u2019s hockey team won 3 straight Olympic gold medals and 10 consecutive world championships. Nick Paumgarten of The New Yorker explores the political and cultural crossover between the team from behind Iron Curtain and the Western World especially at the height of the Cold War, a dynamic that peaked at the 1980 Winter Olympics with the Miracle on Ice game against the United States. The Soviet cultural phenomenon is explored in greater depth in a documentary, \u201cRed Army,\u201d slated for wide release in January. In the film, Captain Slava Fetisov examines the rise and fall of the Soviet hockey team as national heroes to political enemies and during similar social and cultural ups and downs.

Jim Webb, D-Va., has officially launched his exploratory committee for a presidential run in 2016. Webb posted a 4-page letter and accompanying video to his 2016 website saying, \u201cA strong majority of Americans agree that we are at a serious crossroads. In my view the solutions are not simply political, but those of leadership. I learned long ago on the battlefields of Vietnam that in a crisis, there is no substitute for clear-eyed leadership.\u201d Webb added that, \u201cI made this decision after reflecting on numerous political commentaries and listening to many knowledgeable people.

Webb staunchly supports gun rights, but also backs access to elective abortions and same-sex marriage.Resume - A 1968 graduate of the Naval Academy, Webb served in Vietnam earning numerous awards before entering a law career, serving as counsel to the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee until 1981. Webb then served as Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration. After leaving government, Webb wrote numerous books and screen plays before winning the Virginia Senate seat in 2006. While Webb\u2019s history of the Scots-Irish in America was a massive success, some of his other writings have been controversial. [WashEx: \u201cDemocrats sharpen Wall Street criticism\u201d]WARREN: DEMS HAVE \u2018LONG WAY TO GO\u2019 TO BE PARTY OF THE PEOPLEThe Hill: \u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Wednesday warned that the country is headed in the wrong direction and pushed Democrats to demand a government that does more for working-class citizens. In remarks before the Center for American Progress, the newest member of Senate Democratic leadership argued that the public broadly supports major pieces of the Democratic agenda, but she implied that the party has lost sight of its priorities in recent years. \u201cOur country is headed in the wrong direction,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American dream is slipping out of reach. \u201cThere is a long way to go before Democrats can reclaim the right to say we\u2019re working for America\u2019s people ... but don\u2019t forget the good news: our agenda is America\u2019s agenda,\u201d Warren added. Senate Democrats added Warren to the leadership team following a midterm election drubbing that saw the party lose its Senate majority.\u00a0As a strategic policy adviser, she\u00a0will serve as a liaison to progressive groups.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate joins 'The O'Reilly Factor' to weigh in on his policies and the race for the White House While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don\u2019t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check. LifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a \u201cjoint border security fund\u201d -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border \u2013 for border construction and maintenance. Trump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table. \u201cThere are many ways that they can pay for the wall,\u201d Trump said, calling it a \u201cnegotiation.\u201d But he again insisted, \u201cThe United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.\u201d Breitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins. Trump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night. Speaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used \u2013 though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources. \u201cRecognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThat money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That\u2019s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.\u201d Trump has not addressed such details on the stump. He declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, \u201cMexico will pay for the wall \u2026 they don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay.\u201d That came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn\u2019t discuss \u201cpayment,\u201d while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money. According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto\u2019s claims. If a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher. Estimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically. The U.S. government estimated a decade ago that Mexican traffickers make nearly $14 billion on drug sales to the U.S.",

Putin waved away the urgent rhetoric from Washington about a Russian invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, saying that he had already ordered troops near the region back to their bases. The masked, armed men who look so much like Russian special forces patrolling the streets in Crimea, Putin explained, are just local fighters who have taken to the streets to defend the Russian majority population. But the real troops might show up again, Putin said. Why? Because he wants to protect democracy. From Reuters: \u201c\u2018There can be only one assessment of what happened in Kiev, in Ukraine in general. This was an anti-constitutional coup and the armed seizure of power,\u2019\u00a0 said Putin, looking relaxed as he sat before a small group of reporters at his residence near Moscow. \u2018As for bringing in forces. For now there is no such need but such a possibility exists,\u2019 he said. \u2018What could serve as a reason to use military force? It would naturally be the last resort, absolutely the last.\u2019\u201d Time is on his side - This doesn\u2019t sound like a guy who is smarting from President Obama\u2019s ruling Monday that Russia was \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d Obama, talking to reporters with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, whittled down some of his tougher talk from Friday, saying that \u201cover time\u201d Russia\u2019s incursion would be a \u201ccostly proposition.\u201d The message Putin seems to have taken is that he has time to shore up Russian control of the region before the eventual resolution. Given the international community\u2019s unwillingness to make stark determinations about such things as invasions, especially when they involve a permanent UN Security Council member that is the primary energy supplier to Western Europe, Time does seem to be on Putin\u2019s side, whatever history eventually adjudges. Like this\u2026 KERRY ARRIVES AMID SIGNS OF RUSSIAN TROOP BUILDUPFrom Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen in Kiev : \u201cDispatching sizable troop reinforcements into Crimea on Monday, Russia consolidated its military control over the southeastern Ukrainian territory and may be preparing for a wider invasion of the country, senior U.S. officials traveling with Secretary of State John Kerry to Kiev, the restive Ukrainian capital, said early Tuesday. \u2018We still have a very real concern that the Russians have other plans in the Ukraine,\u2019 said one senior U.S. official, briefing reporters aboard Kerry\u2019s official airplane en route from New York to Kiev. \u2018They may be planning other moves.\u201d More [Watch Fox: Sen.

This, of course, came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry touched down in Kiev. As that real-time back-and-forth continues, the long-term political impact in Washington is beginning to sink in. Politico offers a piece on how tethered Hillary Clinton is to Obama foreign policy. After all, she is the face of the infamous \u2018reset with Russia.\u2019 And the behind-the-scenes story about that painful PR moment when Clinton presented her Russian counterpart with a novelty \u2018reset button\u2019 is actually worse than many originally thought. These could make uncomfortable questions on the 2016 campaign trail.\u201d\u00a0- Bret Baier. OBAMACARE VICTIM RETURNS FIRE IN NEW ADNYT: \u201cAmericans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group being challenged by Democrats over the content of its ads attacking the health care law, is pushing back with a new commercial that will begin airing Tuesday in Michigan. The commercial features Julie Boonstra, a Michigan woman who was the subject of an earlier ad, in which she said she had lost the health plan that she preferred for treatment of her leukemia and was facing higher costs because of the health care law. Lawyers for Representative Gary Peters, a Democrat who is seeking Michigan\u2019s open Senate seat, wrote to television stations asking them to demand verification for the claims in the initial commercial\u2026 In the new ad, Ms. Boonstra says the attacks on her credibility have been devastating and accuses Mr. Peters of trying to silence her. \u2018All I want is to be listened to,\u2019 she says in the commercial. \u2018There are thousands of people out there who are hurting because of Obamacare.\u2019\u201d [Watch the new ad here] VULNERABLE DEMS, INSURERS WANT FAST ACTION ON OBAMACARE DELAYThe Hill says a formal announcement of a long-promised change to ObamaCare rules could come as soon as this week as Democrats brace for more backlash from cancelled policies. The change would extend the president\u2019s move to temporarily waive federal regulations that banned millions of existing individual insurance policies. The president issued the waiver after the uproar that followed the revelation that his oft-repeated \u201cif you like it, you can keep it\u201d pledge was false. From WashEx: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t see how they could have a bunch of these announcements going out in September,\u2019 one consultant in the health insurance industry said. \u2018Not when they\u2019re trying to defend the Senate and keep their losses at a minimum in the House. This is not something to have out there right before the election.\u2019 \u2026 The administration\u2019s decision to pursue another extension was confirmed by insurance sources who predicted a public announcement would be \u2018imminent.\u2019 It is unclear how long the extension will be, though one source believed it could last to the end of Obama\u2019s second term, and perhaps beyond\u2026 Health insurers are meeting in Washington, D.C., this week for two major conferences hosted by their trade group, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. Several sources said they had heard chatter about an extension but that the administration had not made efforts to discuss the possibility with industry officials.\u201d [Yeah, but - The waiver may help give Democrats something to say about the false promises they made when passing and defending the law in 2010 and 2012, but it\u2019s not clear that state insurance commissioners can or will comply with this talking-point generation system.

Now, everybody knows that Congress isn\u2019t doing any fiscal rock breaking between now and Election Day. This plan, like the Republican alternatives starting to dribble out, is about trying to win those elections. For the president, that means incentivizing his base to get out and vote. Washington Examiner has the details on Obama\u2019s vision for a future without Republican budget worrywarts, including expanding and making permanent a $60 billion-a-year program that gives tax refunds to people who don\u2019t pay federal income taxes. \u201c\u2026the budget will include an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, as well as other tax changes to aid college students and help promote retirement savings. Although the White House did not specify the budgetary cost of its proposed programs, it said in a release that the tax breaks would be offset in the budget by raising taxes on certain high-income earners. \u2026 The main feature of the White House\u2019s plan would be to make permanent the expansion of the EITC to families with three or more children from the 2009 stimulus, and to increase the tax break even further by expanding it for childless workers\u2026 The EITC is intended to aid poor people while also encouraging work. It is a refundable tax credit that accrues to low-wage workers, phasing out with income.\u201d [Watch Fox: Sen.

John Cornyn after his challenger ran a campaign so disastrous that even top grassroots activists in Texas have disavowed him. Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican as minority whip, should have little trouble securing the GOP nomination Tuesday in his bid for a third term, even though some activists dismiss him as too moderate and his firebrand colleague, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, has refused to say whether he'll vote for him. Cornyn appears safe because the best-known of the seven Republicans vying to unseat him is U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman. The congressman stunned political observers when, just three months before the primary, he withdrew his re-election bid to his suburban Houston district and filed to run for Senate.\u201d Cruz:\u00a0 I\u2019m no Mr. Congeniality - In an interview with columnist Cal Thomas, Sen.

Lee says in a statement: \u201cNebraskans need Ben Sasse to represent their values, reformers in the Senate need his conservative vote, our country needs his voice.\u201d Lee\u2019s endorsement adds to a growing list for Sasse, including Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Club for Growth and the Jim DeMint-founded Senate Conservatives Fund. [The Hill: Republican Shane Osborn nabbed the endorsement of social conservative leader Phyllis Schlafly in his bid for Senate in Nebraska.

I think they understand me better.\u2019\u2026 Boehner stopped short of saying he will serve out the entire term in Congress if he is re-elected.

It\u2019s what Marc Ambinder calls \u201cthe last, best hope for Democrats\u201d to save the Senate. The plan calls for broad executive action by President Obama to legalize illegal immigrants to goad Republicans into a similar fight as last year\u2019s failed effort to strip funding from ObamaCare. The next shutdown deadline comes on Sept. 30 and if the president drops his executive action on immigration on schedule (\u201cend of the summer\u201d) it would be just in time to chum the water ahead of votes on a short-term budget measure. Ambinder writes: \u201cGo big on immigration. Wait for the GOP counter-reaction. Quietly pray for the government to get shut down. Use it like a cattle prod to wake voters up just before the midterms.\u201d [Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who says he\u2019s been \u201clistening very carefully\u201d in meetings at the White House hinted to Sean Hannity that he believes \u201cover six million undocumented workers\u201d will be granted amnesty by the president.]Hitting the sweet spot - The president would need to find a sweet spot in which his allies in big business and his liberal base both like the action, but it doesn\u2019t create further uproar among Democratic Senate candidates who are taking increasingly harsh lines against Obama\u2019s vaunted \u201cpen power.\u201d Georgia Senate nominee Michelle Nunn, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu have all raised warnings about executive overreach. It\u2019s not surprising. If Obama goes too far, the voter backlash could be intense. Fashioning the kind of action that can please business, activists and red state Democrats is no easy task, especially since Obama will need some legal defense in order to not have a court toss it out before the plan can even get started. [Daily Caller: \u201cClose to 80 organizations, including the National Council of La Raza and the AFL-CIO, are asking the administration to allow illegal immigrants who are granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status to seek health coverage on Obamacare exchanges.\u201d]Fantasyland - Obama could hit a hole-in-one in \u2013 please his business-activist coalition but still manage to enrage conservatives enough to demand a shutdown to block the president. That\u2019s the scenario that is providing some comfort to Democrats these days, but as we see on other issues Democratic unity is no sure bet these days. The most likely scenario seems to be that Obama comes up with something unsatisfying to most involved and that Speaker John Boehner can convince his members to deny Democrats a shutdown just ahead of the election, but stranger things have happened. Not many, though.ENDANGERED DEMS NAME AND SHAME OBAMA ON GLOBAL WARMING EXECUTIVE ACTIONWashington Examiner: \u201cSen. Mary Landrieu [D-La.], chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is warning the president against agreeing to any climate pact that would \u2018negotiate away\u2019 the nation\u2019s growing energy sector. And Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., pledged to work with Congress \u2018to do everything we can\u2019 to stop executive branch moves that hurt the coal industry\u2026 \u2018It is important that all nations do what they can to reduce carbon in the atmosphere,\u2019 Landrieu said in a statement. \u2018But the president should not take any action that undermines the American Energy Revolution currently underway that is creating thousands of high-paying jobs for middle-class families in Louisiana and across the country.\u2019Bad timing - Politico today rhapsodizes about how Rep. Gary Peters, who is struggling to hold a Senate seat for Democrats in Michigan, is an outlier in his party on the issue of global warming. Peters is under fire for investments that don\u2019t match his environmental rhetoric and for doing the bidding of political patrons. [A new ad launched by the National Republican Senatorial Committee seeks to paint Peters as out of touch for supporting the Wall Street bailout that benefitted his old company. Democrats, meanwhile, are returning to abortion attacks on Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land.]DEMANDS GROW FOR SYRIA AUTHORIZATIONWhile Democrats are pinning their hopes to save the Senate on a government shutdown, they may not have noticed the growing fight over whether the president needs congressional authority to expand his air war against Islamist militants across the Iraq border to Syria. AP reports that one way around congressional authorization for the escalation would be to obtain \u201cback-channel consent to American attacks\u201d from the genocidal dictator Bashar al Assad. If the administration\u2019s claims are as reedy as that count on serious bipartisan blowback .Rand smacks Hillary on Syria stance - In a WSJ OpEd, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., argues that interventionist like 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton have aided the rise of the terror group ISIS: \u201cTo interventionists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, we would caution that arming the Islamic rebels in Syria created a haven for the Islamic State. We are lucky Mrs. Clinton didn't get her way and the Obama administration did not bring about regime change in Syria. That new regime might well be ISIS.\u201d [The Hill: \u201cHillary Clinton and President Obama plan to both address a women's forum hosted by the Democratic National Committee next month in Washington\u2026 Both Clinton and Obama are scheduled to speak on Sept. 19\u2026]WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... Judah Bellin at City Journal looks at some solutions springing from states to tame the runaway cost of college education. Oregon, Washington, Tennessee and Texas are trying radically different ideas, including the Oregon plan to set student loan repayment as a percent of future income not a dollar amount and Tennessee\u2019s plan to offer free two-year tuition at community and technical colleges. But Texas\u2019 effort may be the most revolutionary. The Lone Star State is \u00a0challenging schools to develop low-cost degree programs for students for who the idea of a four-year, full-time undergraduate degree program is unrealistic: \u201cPerhaps the program\u2019s biggest innovation is that it awards credits for mastery of material, not time spent in the classroom. The \u2018school year\u2019 is divided into six seven-week terms, and students pay a flat fee of $750 for each term that they\u2019re enrolled. Students are free to finish as many credits as they can within each term. \u2026They can proceed at their own pace, giving them significant control over the cost of their degree\u2014a novel notion for American higher education.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Likewise, Begich said several times he needed to educate Sullivan on issues he did not understand, like how the Senate works\u2026 The candidates also clashed on healthcare reform. When it was Sullivan\u2019s turn to ask Begich a question, he asked if the senator could go back and cast the deciding vote on the president\u2019s health-care law again, would he do it again?... \u2018The issue of health-care is a tough call.

Trende\u2019s point is that it\u2019s too soon to say and that defining a \u201cwave\u201d is subjective, anyway. A gain of five seats for the GOP, the low-end expectation for Republicans, would be huge by historical standards, but if the media metric sets the bar at eight seats this cycle, then the wave is called a ripple: \u201cSo to a certain degree, I think the question of why we don\u2019t see a wave today involves a false premise: We see evidence of one right now. I suspect our expectations for a 2014 wave were simply set too high during the Obamacare rollout.\u201dPICK SIX: SUN SHINES ON GOP IN SOUTH DAKOTARepublicans need six additional seats to win control of the Senate and as Fox News Correspondent John Roberts reports today from Pierre, prospects for a pick-up in South Dakota has the GOP smiling in the late summer sun. With incumbent Sen. Democrat Tim Johnson retiring after seventeen years, the seat is wide open and the prospects look good for former Republican Gov. Mike Rounds in the solidly red state. Rounds faces Democrat Rick Weiland. The lack of enthusiastic support expressed earlier this month by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid may have been on Weiland\u2019s mind when he accidentally \u201cceded\u201d the race to Rounds in the candidates first debate.

On January 27, Clinton sent an e-mail to top aide Cheryl Mills and State Department undersecretary Patrick Kennedy. \u2018The Brits have just called for their citizens to leave Somalia. What\u2019s our position?\u2019 she asked. Kennedy gently replied that the American government \u2018[has] a long-time published travel warning against all travel to Somalia.

The already paranoid Stalin saw Kirov\u2019s rise to leader of the Communist Party in Leningrad as a new provocation, despite Kirov\u2019s long support for Stalin. Historians also believe that Kirov\u2019s hedonistic lifestyle was an embarrassment to Stalin\u2019s push for ascetic conformity in the new workers\u2019 paradise. Stalin was publicly supportive of his old comrade, proffering \u2013 and then deferring \u2013 promotions to high office in Moscow. But all the while, Stalin was plotting. With the help of one of Kirov\u2019s security deputies, Stalin found an assassin to take out his could-be rival. Of the millions Stalin killed, Kirov\u2019s death still stands out. The murder was the pretext that Stalin would use to launch the next and most dramatic round of the purge of his enemies from within Soviet government and life. The enemies of the revolution, Stalin said, were responsible for Kirov\u2019s murder and needed to be rooted out.\u00a0 How right he was\u2026 Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Const. Scott Heron was charged in September 2012 following an investigation into an operation involving the purchasing cases of cheese in bulk from south of the border and bringing it into Fort Erie without declaring the cheese or paying duty. Once in Canada, the cheese was sorted and prepared for distribution to a variety of restaurants in the region. At the time of the arrest, the NRP said there was significant money to be made from the operation. Police say about $200,000 worth of cheese was smuggled in, generating a profit of about $165,000.\u201dAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThe idea that the terrorists attacked in Paris because they wanted to prevent the leaders of the world of having a meeting over the rise of the ocean in a hundred years is simply absurd.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201dChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "FILE- IN this June 11, 2015, file photo, actress Diane Guerrero attends Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ORANGECON Celebration at Skylight Clarkson SQ in New York. The depression, the anxiety and the emotional instability that Guerrero went through due to the separation from her parents are some of the points she writes about in her new memoir \"In the Country We Love: My Family Divided,\" as well as her later professional development and her work in the successful Netflix series \"Orange Is The New Black\" and The CW\u2019s \"Jane The Virgin.\" (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) (The Associated Press) LOS ANGELES \u2013 One afternoon upon returning from school, Diane Guerrero found her home empty. The TV actress was only 14 when she was left completely alone after her parents were detained and deported to their native Colombia. The depression, anxiety and emotional instability that followed are some of the personal struggles the 29-year-old actress reveals in her new memoir, \"In the Country We Love: My Family Divided.\" She also discusses her later development as an actress and working on the popular Netflix series \"Orange Is the New Black\" and The CW's \"Jane The Virgin.\" In essence, the 257-pages book, just released by Henry Holt and Co., illustrates one of the heartbreaks of today's immigration crisis: U.S.-born children who are left alone when their parents are deported. About 4.1 million American children have at least one parent who lives in the U.S. illegally, according to the Migration Policy Institute. \"We have a lot of comments on the news, we have a lot of rhetoric over what an immigrant is and what a deportee is, but you don't hear any real stories. I don't think we ever had the chance to really tell our side,\" said Guerrero, responding in a recent interview to why she wrote the book. \"I am here, a citizen of this country and I'm saying, 'Hey, the system failed me. I am a good citizen. I contribute to this country and here I am sharing my story. What are you going to do now?'\" she added. Guerrero's older brother was also deported, but she decided to stay behind with friends because of her firm belief that America offered many more opportunities than Colombia. \"My parents were clear from the beginning (about the possibility of deportation). That was a topic of every day, so I was very well aware and my father did a good job of preparing me if the inevitable happened,\" said the actress. \"I wanted to follow my dreams and finish what my parents started when they came here for better opportunities. It was a difficult decision and I don't know if, in hindsight, I would have changed it.\" At one point, Guerrero was so depressed over the absence of her parents, mounting debt and other problems, that she tried to take her own life. \"Once I got to college, that anxiety and pain and confusion kind of came forth. ... Everything that I did or tried to do was harder than normal because I didn't have my parents and their support,\" said the actress. \"I went through many stages. I went through depression, which is something that we don't often talk about when we look at undocumented communities and deported families.\" Her love for the arts started in high school, at the Boston Arts Academy. She later attended Regis College and studied to be a paralegal until she decided to sign up with a Boston casting agency and finally pursue her dream. \"There's light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Guerrero. \"I know that things are scary and we may have a lot of fears, but what we can do now is educate ourselves, we can educate others, we can join this movement, we can understand that our stories are valuable, that we are important and that ... like it or not, we make up the fabric of this country and we have to fight to be part of it because we are part of it, regardless of how many people are telling us that we don't belong.\" Guerrero first told her story in November 2014 in an article in the Los Angeles Times. She was inspired by so-called \"dreamers,\" who publicly acknowledge they grew up in the U.S. without documentation but who are fully assimilated and feel very much like Americans. Reaction to the article was immediate. A few days later, she met President Barack Obama at an event in Las Vegas where he expounded on his just-announced executive order offering dreamers a pathway to documentation. Guerrero's work in \"Orange Is the New Black\" and \"Jane the Virgin\" has yielded success and popularity that she is now using to promote citizenship and voter registration among immigrants, in collaboration with organizations like Immigrant Legal Resource Center and Mi Familia Vota. The actress says writing \"In the Country We Love\" has been a cathartic experience for her. \"After coming out with the book and my story, I feel a lot better, a little clearer about who I am and I don't feel like I'm lying to other people and, most important, I don't feel like I'm lying to myself,\" said Guerrero. \"I want immigration reform to come into fruition and I want it to be comprehensive and I want it to have a path to citizenship and I want to be involved politically every day,\" she added. \"I'm doing that and I'm feeling better because before, I was just kind of floating, you know, I wasn't being a political being and I didn't know where my responsibilities lied in my community and now I've found that.\" ___ Follow E.J.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Whatevs! President makes clear ObamaCare numbers don\u2019t matter \u2022 Showdown in Ariz. \u2022 Gut check on Obama overreach \u2022 Sink-ing: Dem worries about getting maids, landscapers \u2022 Obama has say on size of Clinton docu-dump \u2022 Anatomy of a breakup OBAMA CELEBRATES WEAK HEALTH LAW ENROLLMENT President Obama now claims that 4 million people have signed up for ObamaCare. That\u2019s far below the number of policies cancelled under the law, so it\u2019s not too surprising that there would be a market for the program. It\u2019s also far below the 7 million enrollments to which the administration once aspired. Plus, based on the president\u2019s track record on ObamaCare statistics, we can have relatively little confidence in this number. But however many millions of people have voluntarily complied with the law, we certainly don\u2019t know how many of them have actually paid for policies or obtained coverage. It\u2019s a mess the magnitude of which we will only start to understand in the months after the current enrollment drive ends on March 31. But here\u2019s something we do know: Whatever the enrollment numbers, the president and his team will call it a victory \u2013 as Vice President Joe Biden said, \u201ca hell of a start.\u201d The wonk patrol is testing administration assumptions and warning that these crummy numbers could damage the overall viability of the law. They\u2019re missing the point, though. Once it was clear that the implementation of ObamaCare would be this ghastly, victory was off the table. The name of the game now: survive and advance. Whatevs - If you want to know how little emphasis is placed on quality when it comes to ObamaCare, consider the new revelation that the team working on the rollout plunged ahead with launch despite urgent warnings about dangers to consumer data. As one email reads \u201cThe front office is signing [authorizations to proceed] whether or not they are a high risk.\u201d That kind of sums it up for the launch and the law\u2019s ongoing travails. It\u2019s governance YOLO style. The bailouts built into the law give the president confidence that he can deluge the insurance industry with enough tax dollars to keep everything afloat for a few years, whatever happens now. That, combined with selective enforcement of troublesome provisions, ought to keep the law sputtering along until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. By then, Americans will have come to accept the new normal of ObamaCare. As the president himself says, the law will be seen as successful after he has left office. Until then, it\u2019s time to grin and bear it. Sounds like a super fun second half of your second term, Mr. President. JUST FOR THE RECORD, MADAM SECRETARY That was then - \u201cWell, I think success looks like at least seven million people having signed up by the end of March 2014.\u201d\u2014Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to NBC News, Sept. 2013. This is now - \u201cFirst of all, seven million was not the administration. That was a CBO, Congressional Budget Office, prediction when the bill was first signed. I'm not sure where they even got their numbers.\u201d \u2013 Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to Huffington Post Tuesday. A wipeout not seen since Greg Brady went surfing - LAT: \u201c\u2026[F]our months after enrollments began, the [Hawaii\u2019s ObamaCare program] has allocated $120 million while signing up only about 4,300 people for health plans \u2013 fewer than any other state.

We\u2019ve only been in the market for 5 years. This is a very burdensome tax because it is based on sales, not profits, and the only way we can pay a tax like this is to cut expenses,\u2019 OrthoPediatrics CEO Mark Throdahl told The Daily Caller.\u201d SLOW LERNER: IRS OFFICAL TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY AGAIN Lois Lerner is likely heading back to the spotlight. Fox News has obtained a letter from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., to the attorney representing Lerner, the former IRS executive at the center of the political targeting scandal at the tax-collection agency. In the letter summons Lerner to appear at a \u201ccontinuation of the May 22, 2013 hearing on March 5, 2014.\u201d Lerner left last year\u2019s hearing after invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination. To preserve the right to recall Lerner, Issa recessed the hearing. She remains under subpoena for the remainder of this Congress. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOWDOWN IN ARIZONAIn a scenario reminiscent of the furor over Arizona\u2019s tough illegal immigration law in 2010, the state\u2019s legislature has passed a bill protecting business owners who refuse to provide services for same-sex nuptials. The law has been quickly shorthanded to being \u201canti-gay\u201d and the subject of a massive backlash, with lots of moderate Republicans calling on term-limited Republican Gov. Jan Brewer to do everybody a favor and veto the bill. Even the new gay-enthusiasts at the NFL are in the mix, threatening to strip the state of next year\u2019s Super Bowl, scheduled to be played outside of Phoenix.\u00a0 Brewer\u2019s team indicated she\u2019s not likely to rush her decision, and past performance on the immigration bill and other issues does not indicate she is one who much bows to public pressure. But what if it costs lots and lots of jobs from high-profile employers? Tough spot, Madam Governor. [Attorney General Eric Holder, though, has a solution if Brewer does opt to sign the law: selective enforcement. Holder told state attorneys general that they should not work to uphold laws they find objectionable.] Bug in the code - National Review\u2019s Tim Cavanaugh sifts through the law and concludes it might actually be harmful to the goals of its proponents: \u201c[The law] sets out to fix a bug that looks to me like a feature: On the issue of the right to turn down business, Arizona does not have one code of conduct for the entire state. S.B. 1062, if I\u2019m reading it correctly, would overturn that, making it impossible for, say, Phoenix to pass a different set of laws from Prescott. You may argue that that\u2019s good, because First Amendment freedom of conscience should not be abridged by municipal authorities (who are usually the very worst of tyrants). But local abridgments of speech rights happen all the time, in the form of billboard restrictions, bans on certain kinds of advertising, and the many house-beautiful requirements zoning martinets love. This is the beauty of having 31 flavors: People in Yuma don\u2019t necessarily have to live the same way as people in Tucson. Scaled up, it\u2019s the compelling argument for \u201cexperiments in living\u201d and interstate competition. But in this case we\u2019re talking about a state governor\u2019s veto power, and so the argument needs to be scaled down. Mobility among states is easy enough; mobility within a single state is even easier. If Phoenix wants to pass a law infringing the rights of religious bakers, or Kingman wants to require everybody to sing \u201cRoute 66\u2033 once a day, they can be allowed to do so and reap the rewards or punishments. If an overwhelming majority of Arizonans were excited about S.B. 1062\u2019s aims, they could adopt it, tell the NFL to go to hell, and let dissenters head to New Mexico.\u201d GUT CHECK FOR GOP ON OBAMA OVERREACHAre House Republicans ready to take the president to court over his executive overreach? That\u2019s the question before Congress today as Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C., testifies about his legislation that would put before a judge the constitutionality of the president\u2019s ever-expanding claim to greater executive power. Previewing his testimony today in an appearance on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Rice said \u201cIf the judge finds the president\u2019s actions unconstitutional then those actions will be null and void.\u201d So how do Republicans get there? [President Obama today visits St. Paul, Minn. where he will again tout his unilateral power, extolling the program which provided $35 million to refurbish the city\u2019s old train station.] Ready to take the plunge? - Rice wants his colleagues to back a resolution finding that Obama has not faithfully executed his own health law, most notably in ignoring regulations that might make ObamaCare even more damaging.\u00a0 As Rice told Megyn Kelly, \u201cThe president has no right to delay a tax. He has no right to say that this group of people doesn\u2019t have to pay the tax.\u201d But if Rice prevails, Republicans would be in the position of arguing in court on behalf of destructive taxes, regulations and fines that would be imposed retroactively. Sounds pretty punitive for a party that bills itself as the nation\u2019s deliverance from the troubled health law. Perhaps Obama would relent and agree to sign legislation delaying the entire law if that were so, but the result would be a high-stakes game of chicken with a president who proved during the partial government shutdown last year that he does not mind bringing the pain. [Who knew 32 percent could look so good? - Gallup\u2019s latest survey finds House Speaker John Boehner holds a 32 percent favorability rating, with 50 percent disapproving, returning to levels he saw prior to the October government shutdown.]WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...

It creates a false impression of how risky the present is, and it fuels unnecessary, freedom-killing regulations. Old people always talk about the good old days. But the good old days were not so good. When I was young, more kids were intolerant, racist, sexist and homophobic. They had little knowledge of life beyond their neighborhoods.

And we don\u2019t need to put those employers in a position of hiring undocumented and illegal workers.\u2019 The Sarasota County GOP used her comments like a gift horse.

The papers contain confidential advice given to or sought by President Bill Clinton, including communications with then-first lady Hillary Clinton, and records about people considered for appointments to federal office. About 33,000 pages of documents are involved, according to the National Archives, which runs the library. Under the Presidential Records Act, such records can be withheld for up to 12 years after a president leaves office. However, at the 12-year mark, those broad restrictions fall away and the once-secret presidential papers are generally subject to disclosure. For the Clinton files, that milestone came and went in January 2013.The long-sealed records pose a delicate series of choices for the Clintons, and even President Barack Obama. They could allow disclosure of the papers, fueling new stories about old controversies like Whitewater and pardons granted as the 42nd president left office in 2001. Or they could fight to keep some or all of the files secret, likely triggering a court battle and stoking concerns that the former president and his wife are unduly secretive\u2026 \u00a0an official with the current White House said Tuesday afternoon that a large batch of the formerly withheld Clinton records should emerge soon.\u2018The White House has cleared a significant number of P2/P5 Clinton documents \u2026 roughly 25,000 pages,\u2019 said the Obama aide, citing the legal designations originally used to withhold the records. The aide, who asked not to be named, did not say precisely when that clearance was given. However, he added: \u2018There have been no executive privilege assertions on Clinton materials to date.\u2019\u2019\u2019 RUBIO WON\u2019T BOW TO JEBThe Hill: \u201cSen.

            "article_content": "Presidential candidate reportedly visiting Jordan amid debate over refugee policy; Reaction on 'America's Newsroom' Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson finished touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan Saturday and suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries. \u201cI did not detect any great desire for them to come to the United States,\" Carson told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Jordan. \"You've got these refugee camps that aren't completely full. And all you need is the resources to be able to run them. Why do you need to create something else?\" Carson toured the Azraq camp in northern Jordan under heavy Jordanian security. The tour was closed off to journalists. Carson\u2019s campaign also limited access, not providing his itinerary. Upon finishing his tour, Carson reiterated his opposition to allowing any Syrian refugees to come to the U.S., saying he didn\u2019t learn anything that gives him confidence in authorities\u2019 ability to screen potential terrorists. \"What I learned is that you're going to get a different answer from everybody depending on what their slant is,\" he said. \"I always oppose doing unnecessary things, particularly dangerous and costly unnecessary things.\u201d Carson also urged Americans to launch a \u201chumanitarian drive\u201d to raise billions of dollars that officials say is needed to improve the conditions for refugees settled across several countries in the Middle East. Carson told the Associated Press said all the refugees needed is \u201cadequate funding.\u201d \u201cThey were quite willing to stay there as long as it takes before they can get back home.\" Carson has often taken a harsh tone when discussing the refugee crisis, including how the U.S. handle resettling the refugees on American soil, amid concerns about terrorists foiling the vetting process. Last week, he likened blocking potential terrorists posing as Syrian refugees to handling a rabid dog. He also suggested Saturday that it would be best to absorb Syrian refugees in Middle Eastern host countries, which have given temporary shelter to most of the more than 4 million Syrians who have fled civil war in their country since 2011. In a separate statement, he described Syrians as \"as very hard working, determined people, which should only enhance the overall economic health of the neighboring Arab countries that accept and integrate them into the general population.\" And he broadened his call for financial support beyond Americans: \"The humanitarian crisis presented by the fleeing Syrian refugees can be addressed if the nations of the world with resources would provide financial and material support to the aforementioned countries as well as encouragement.\" More than 4 million Syrians fled their homeland since 2011, after a popular uprising erupted against President Bashar Assad and quickly turned into a devastating civil war. Most initially settled in neighboring countries, but conditions there have become increasingly difficult. Carson and his GOP rivals have criticized the administration\u2019s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees this budget year. The retired neurosurgeon has repeatedly struggled to discuss international affairs as they become a greater focus in the 2016 presidential contest. Those close to him concede his foreign policy fluency isn't yet where it needs to be. And they hope missions like this will help change that. \"I'd say he's 75 percent of the way there,\" Armstrong Williams, Carson's longtime business manager and closest confidant, said last week of the candidate's grasp of foreign policy. \"The world is a complex place, and he wants to get it right.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Are Republicans in danger of losing majority in the House? An influential conservative group is urging the Republican-led House to postpone its looming leadership vote, potentially offering House Speaker Paul Ryan a chance to get his \u2018house\u2019 in order at a time when his detractors are renewing threats to oust him in the aftermath of the \u201cchaotic\u201d 2016 election. The Tea Party-tied FreedomWorks sent a message Monday to the House Republican Caucus telling members to wait until December to decide on a speaker. FreedomWorks leader Adam Brandon said Tuesday the push does not reflect support for Ryan; only a call for members \u201cto reassess and reflect\u201d after a \u201chistorically long, chaotic election cycle.\u201d \u201cThis is not a pro-Ryan or anti-Ryan,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cThere\u2019s just no reason to rush. It\u2019s a delicate process. Take your time and get it right.\u201d Brandon also said his group is \u201cvery close in mind\u201d to the House Freedom Caucus, a leading critic of Ryan since the chamber elected him speaker in fall 2015. But any delay in the speaker nomination could give Ryan extra time to mend a divided conference and even deliver on conservative wish list items in the lame-duck session. Brandon urged Ryan to \u201cfight for fiscal sanity and conservative priorities\u201d upon returning to Capitol Hill, especially when it comes to a government spending bill -- suggesting Ryan\u2019s political future should be tied to those results. The House leadership has given no indication it would even consider postponing such a vote. Newly elected members customarily join sitting members in November in a private session to casts the leadership votes, then have a full floor vote in January when the new Congress convenes. Republican strategist Rob Carter on Tuesday downplayed the call for a delay from FreedomWorks. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to gin up contributions. I get it. But as for the substance of it, I cannot take it seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House Republican Conference will hold its leadership vote like it always does. Paul Ryan does not lack for support from Republicans with the exception of a handful trying to disrupt.\u201d Ryan still faces a restive chamber upon his return, after a presidential race that divided Republican lawmakers and saw Ryan distancing himself from presidential nominee Donald Trump. And the challenges he confronted upon becoming speaker in October 2015 remain. As recently as last month, before Congress broke for the elections, Ryan agreed to a so-called continuing resolution to keep the government open past Dec. 31. However, he needed votes from Democrats upon losing support from the House Freedom Caucus and other fiscally conservative Republicans in the chamber, in large part because such a resolution maintains spending levels instead of cutting them. In addition, the final bill failed to include a measure to halt President Obama\u2019s plan to accept Syrian refugees or cut Planned Parenthood money in exchange for more funding to combat the Zika virus. John Boehner, the House speaker before Ryan, was effectively run out by conservatives for similarly cutting deals with Democrats to pass legislation. Ryan splitting with Trump after an audiotape surfaced of him bragging in 2005 about kissing and groping women has only increased the rift with some House members. The 30-member Freedom Caucus held a mid-October conference call in which members reportedly discussed backing an alternative to Ryan for speaker. North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus member, later told a local radio station the effort to replace Ryan is \u201cpicking up some steam.\u201d \"A lot of people who believe so desperately that we need to put Donald Trump in the White House -- they question the loyalty of the speaker,\" he said on WAAV Radio. Rank-and-file House Republicans are trying to help Ryan in case of a revolt. California Rep. Devin Nunes recently made a proposal to stop any member from trying to oust the speaker with a procedure called a \u201cmotion to vacate the chair.\u201d The motion results in a vote of no confidence that the speaker must defeat with a majority. The Nunes proposal reportedly would require majority support for the motion to be filed. Ryan has, meanwhile, continued to fulfill his promise to help Republicans this election cycle keep control of the House and Senate, while not campaigning for Trump. Supporters say Ryan remains in high demand across the country. He has so far this month attended at least 75 events across at least 17 states in support of GOP House incumbents and challengers and reportedly raised $50 million this year, with more than half going to the National Republican Congressional Committee. And in the final four days of the 2016 campaign, Ryan is expected to visit an additional four states and join incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson on a bus tour across their home state of Wisconsin. Ryan will have visited 21 states from October through early November in support of House and Senate candidates.",

            "article_content": "Reaction to the president's message, ties to 2016 election The war in Syria has been ravaging on for five years and six months producing four million refugees, 400,000 deaths and a growing threat to regional peace and security. Despite President Obama\u2019s pronouncements of concern, his U.N. Ambassador\u2019s consistent tweeting about the violence and death, his 60 plus nation coalition and his secretary of state\u2019s flurry of diplomatic meetings, the president of the United States has been unable to make real progress towards peace or even stability. President Obama is having a hard time with candidate Obama\u2019s promises to end all wars, not start any new ones and bring all U.S. troops home. In other words, candidate Obama\u2019s grandiose commitments from 2008 are running smack into President Obama\u2019s intelligence briefings. A few weeks before his re-election in 2012, Obama promised that his political calculus would change if he saw that the Syrian government was using chemical weapons in the war.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, the United Nations confirmed that the Syrian government and military was indeed gassing their own people. Four years after his re-election eve campaign promise, Obama hasn\u2019t followed through on his promise to protect the Syrian people. In his eighth and final United Nations speech this week, Obama missed the opportunity to lead once again.  While thousands of international diplomats gathered in the UN General Assembly hall to hear him, the president largely ignored the Syrian conflict.  It was a glaring omission and missed opportunity to re-focus the world\u2019s attention on ISIS and Assad. \u201cFor the Syrian government to utilize chemical weapons on its people crosses a line that will change my calculus and how the United States approaches these issues,\u201d Obama said in April 2013.\u00a0 It was a statement heralded at the time by U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, who made a loud and proud commitment of her own before becoming ambassador to the U.N. that if she was ever in a position of power that she would commit to the U.N.\u2019s Responsibility to Protect doctrine, calling on powerful nations to proactively protect vulnerable people in crises. Instead, Obama has kept his original campaign promise to not send additional U.S. troops to Syria, relying instead on Kurdish forces to gather the necessary intelligence needed to run an air campaign.\u00a0 But finding the command and control center of the Islamic radical group ISIS is proving to require more than just a daily bombing campaign. Timely and consistent intelligence from the ground is the only way to pinpoint the location of the ISIS leaders and the way to avoid mistakes like the one last week where U.S. forces accidentally killed 62 Syrian government troops they had mistaken for ISIS fighters. The Kurdish forces gathering most of the U.S. intelligence, meanwhile, are being attacked by Turkey, the U.S.\u2019 NATO ally. \u201cThe rules of engagement we are required to follow don\u2019t allow us to act in the way we want to,\u201d a U.S. military planner told me.\u00a0 \u201cWe see what is needed but aren\u2019t allowed to go there.\u201d The U.S. military is the best in the world, but without the freedom to gather the necessary intelligence on ISIS, we won\u2019t be able to find them and destroy them as they move around the country. NATO and the U.N. can only be successful in fighting extremism and combatting terrorism if the U.S. is leading the strategy.\u00a0 And with Turkey fighting the Kurds, Russia defending President Bashar al Assad while the U.S. policy says Assad should go, it is clear the U.S. isn\u2019t leading. At the Democratic Convention in July, President Obama made clear that the next president of the United States would still be trying to defeat ISIS in January 2017.\u00a0 It was a stunning admission. In his eighth and final United Nations speech this week, Obama missed the opportunity to lead once again.\u00a0 While thousands of international diplomats gathered in the UN General Assembly Hall to hear him, the president largely ignored the Syrian conflict.\u00a0 It was a glaring omission and missed opportunity to re-focus the world\u2019s attention on ISIS and Assad. It\u2019s clear to even the casual foreign policy observer that President Obama has resigned to the fact that he has failed to stop ISIS and that Bashar al-Assad will still be in power when he leaves the White House.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) If you believe the pundits, Donald Trump is going to wage a one-man revolution if he loses the 2016 presidential election. That was the media\u2019s big takeaway from the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas between Trump and Hillary Clinton. At issue was a question posed by moderator Chris Wallace regarding whether Trump would accept the election results. \"I will tell you at the time,\" Trump replied. \"I'll keep you in suspense. OK?\" Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! The mainstream media went apoplectic. They want you\u00a0to believe that\u00a0Trump is going to gallop down 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on a white stallion leading a battalion of Minute Men armed with muskets and waving the Gadsden flag. The MSM is advancing this outrageous narrative to avoid covering legitimate scandals \u2013 like the James O\u2019Keefe videos exposing DNC thuggery and the WikiLeaks emails that reveal media collusion with the Clinton campaign. Hillary Clinton and her minions have attacked Catholics, Evangelicals, Republicans, Rednecks and Southern beauty queens as a bunch of irredeemable deplorable bigots. Her outright contempt for everyday Americans and our values should disqualify her from being the next leader of the free world. I have no doubt a Clinton presidency would soil the U.S. Constitution much like that DNC tour bus did on the streets of Lawrenceville, Georgia. So here are my top 10 takeaways: 1.\u00a0Mr. Trump needs to stay focused on the issues.\u00a0The American people don\u2019t care about the alleged sex scandal and I doubt they care about his remarks on whether he will concede the election if he loses. Voters do care about jobs, securing the border, protecting the Second Amendment and preventing radical leftists from commandeering the Supreme Court. The American people do not care about phony crises and scandals manufactured by Hillary Clinton\u2019s fanboys in the Mainstream Media. 2.\u00a0Unborn lives matter.\u00a0Christians who are still undecided about voting should reflect on Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s comments regarding late-term, partial birth abortions. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of a baby,\u201d Trump said. Clinton did not deny the charge. Instead, she called it \u201cscare rhetoric.\u201d 3.\u00a0Hillary's basket of dirty tricks.\u00a0Thanks to the fine undercover work of James O\u2019Keefe we know that the Democrats were allegedly involved in a dirty tricks campaign. They disrupted Trump campaign events \u2013 leaving innocent Americans bloodied and battered. WikiLeaks revealed that her campaign\u2019s goal was to portray Republicans as bigots and extremists. Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats must be held accountable. 4.\u00a0Add gun-toting toddlers to Hillary\u2019s \"basket of deplorables.\" Mrs. Clinton offered a bizarre theory for why she wants to crack down on the Second Amendment. \u201cDozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions,\u201d she said. 5.\u00a0Liberals accused me of being sexist. A motley crew of leftists slammed me on social media last night for calling the Democratic nominee \u201cMiss Hillary.\u201d Upon deep personal reflection, I\u2019d like to offer a public apology to\u00a0Mrs. Bill Clinton. 6.\u00a0Chris Wallace was the winner of last night\u2019s debate.\u00a0My colleague at Fox News delivered a fair and balanced debate to the nation. He kept the candidates and the crowd on point. It was a tremendous job. How refreshing to have a moderator instead of someone auditioning to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s press secretary. Well done, Mr. Wallace! 7.\u00a0The Case of the hanging chad.\u00a0The mainstream media are once again is predicting Trump\u2019s demise \u2013 they are furious over his refusal to say whether he will concede the election if he loses. CNN called it a death blow. One well-known pundit said it was political suicide. Mrs. Clinton said she was horrified. I wonder if she was horrified when Al Gore challenged the 2000 presidential election. The MSM seems to have come down with a sudden case of amnesia. 8.\u00a0It depends on what \"open borders\" means.\u00a0Clinton was asked to explain a quote from a speech divulged by WikiLeaks on her dream for \u201copen borders.\u201d She dodged the question. \u00a0But I\u2019ll be glad to answer for her. She wants to sacrifice American sovereignty. Under President Hillary Clinton \u2013 our nation will be overrun by illegals as well as Islamic radicals disguised as refugees. 9.\u00a0Mrs. Clinton should consider purchasing a lovely American flag pin.\u00a0It\u2019s a must-have, patriotic fashion accessory \u2013 especially for presidential candidates. And it goes well with anything \u2013 including pantsuits. 10.\u00a0Let\u2019s keep things in perspective.\u00a0No matter what happens on Election Day, remember that God is still in control \u2013 so let not your heart be troubled, America.",

            "article_content": "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee slams 'dysfunctional' U.S. immigration system Before the blood was dry from ISIS-sympathizer Omar Mateen\u2019s massacre of patrons at an Orlando gay club, anti-gun liberals were busy trying to obscure the real culprit.\u00a0 Despite withering ridicule from the politically correct elite, Donald Trump stood firm in his convictions to act decisively against radical Islam\u2014perhaps his greatest qualification to be president. Mateen was an Islamist sympathizer who took time before his attack to call 911 and profess his allegiance to ISIS.\u00a0 He yelled the now-familiar jihadist cry of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d during the rampage that killed fifty-one and wounded as many more.\u00a0 He had been interviewed twice by the FBI for possible ties to terrorists, including to the first American suicide bomber in Syria.\u00a0 And of course he targeted gays, who in Islamist incubators like Iran and the Islamic State are summarily executed. Liberals instinctively seized an opportunity to indulge political correctness.\u00a0 For some reason, Hillary Clinton issued a statement and tweeted in Spanish, and added, \u201cWe need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.\u201d President Obama addressed the nation, saying: \u201cThis massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub.\u201d\u00a0 (This from the man who has ensured a southern border so porous that virtually any illegal weapon cache could be imported inside bricks of cocaine.) Neither Obama nor Hillary mentioned radical Islam. Instead, they tried to take the worst attack by Islamists on our soil since 9/11 and move it down the political path of mass murderers who have shot up schools and a church in recent years. They offered their failed and unconstitutional prescription of more gun control.\u00a0 The misdirection was reminiscent of the Benghazi cover-up, in which Obama and Hillary shifted blame for a jihadist attack away from the Islamists who were actually at fault. Trump is having none of it. The presumptive Republican nominee for president, who has advocated a halt to the admission of refugees from Syria, called for \u201ctoughness and vigilance\u201d against \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d He called on Obama to resign for failing even to mention the political force that animates home-grown terrorists and foreign threats as diverse as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Trump issued a statement that, \u201cWe can't afford to be politically correct anymore,\u201d which further noted, \u201cI am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.\u201d What Trump said wasn\u2019t slick or polished or PC, but it came from the heart\u2014which is enough for most Americans.\u00a0 Most of us don\u2019t want a president who is anti-Muslim, but we want one who is capable of acknowledging the obvious threat posed by Islamic supremacists who want to unify mosque and state, kill gays, Jews, and other Americans and Westerners\u2014and subject everyone else to a theocratic tyranny. Most Americans can see that acknowledging this threat is actually the best way to defend our freedoms here at home.\u00a0 Without doing so we will never develop a defense against it. Rather than taking guns from the law-abiding, we should update laws like the McCarran Act that were used against communists during the Cold War, in order to ban Islamist political activity today. We should be able to keep Islamist refugees and visa applicants from coming to the United States and incriminate the small but dangerous number of Islamist U.S. citizens like Mateen who are here plotting war against us. We should be eager to avoid the means to which Israelis had to resort during the jihadist intifadas against them.\u00a0 These steps included guards and searches at nearly every public venue in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As a gay man, I\u2019ve often wondered when the Islamists would attack us here at home\u2014including at gay venues that pride themselves on being open and welcoming.\u00a0 The time apparently is now. If we don\u2019t want to have to turn our public spaces into fortresses with intrusive, airport-like security, we need to go on the offensive against Islamic supremacists and those who enable them.\u00a0 What Trump suggests is counterintuitively the preservation of freedom. He also offers a watershed for Republicans: a leader who stands up for gays and softens the GOP\u2019s reactionary image on social issues.\u00a0 While the GOP elite\u2014including the oh-so-erudite Romney-Ryan faction that tut-tuts the rest of the party\u2014has consistently advocated second-class citizenship for gays, it is Trump who could drag the party into the 21st century. Ultimately, the 2016 election is a contest between the dishonest elite and the American public. Shortly after the Orlando attack, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remarked about that elite on Fox News: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to tell us the truth about the world, they don\u2019t want to tell us the truth about trade deals, they don\u2019t want to tell us the truth about who is getting payoffs in Washington, and they don\u2019t want to tell us the truth about Islamic terrorism.\u201d If in tragedy we find the resolve to defend our country and our freedom\u2014and reject the failures of our political elite\u2014then those who perished at the hand of an Islamist in Orlando will not have died in vain.",

            "article_content": "2016 candidate speaks out on 'America's Newsroom,' says president does not understand ISIS threat President Obama threatened late Wednesday to veto legislation aimed at improving screening for Syrian refugees, potentially putting the White House and Congress on a collision course in a matter of days. The veto threat came as the House was preparing the bill -- which sets high hurdles for refugee admission including FBI background checks and sign-offs by top officials -- for floor action as early as Thursday. In a committee meeting, Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, accused the president of confusing the public about the intentions of the legislation. Moments later, the White House issued a statement defending the current screening process and claiming the changes called for under the bill would create \"significant delays and obstacles\" for the existing vetting program. \"Given the lives at stake and the critical importance to our partners in the Middle East and Europe of American leadership in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis ... [Obama] would veto the bill,\" the White House said. But House Republicans touted the legislation as a common-sense answer to security concerns. Further, while Republicans a day earlier called for a \"pause\" in Syrian refugee admissions, some on Wednesday indicated a willingness to accept refugees from Syria and Iraq who are fleeing the civil war and Islamic State militants -- provided the screening process is improved, under the terms of the bill. \"America has a proud tradition of welcoming refugees into our country, and we lead the world in humanitarian assistance. However, we also must put proper measures in place to ensure our country's safety,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement. The bill introduced Wednesday would require the FBI director to certify a background investigation for each refugee -- and several top security officials to certify that each refugee is not a security threat to the U.S. -- before a refugee from Iraq or Syria can be admitted. House Speaker Paul Ryan said the chamber would vote on the bill later this week, and stressed that it would not subject applicants to a religious test. He made this clarification after some GOP presidential candidates suggested preference should be given to Christians. McCaul, in a statement, said that while he wants a \"temporary suspension\" of Syrian refugee admissions, \"It is apparent that the President will ignore these concerns, making this legislation necessary to toughen security measures.\" Indeed, Obama on Wednesday continued to defend plans to bring in an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year as he threatened to veto the House bill. \"Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do,\" Obama tweeted late Wednesday morning. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., also touted the latest House bill, saying it was based on legislation he introduced just days earlier. Hudson said the new bill would likely be voted on in the House on Thursday. \"America is a compassionate nation. No country on Earth does more or spends more to care for our fellow man. But being compassionate doesn't mean we have to have reckless policies that put American lives at risk,\" he said in a statement. McCaul's committee also released a report Wednesday on the Syrian refugee flow, saying it reveals \"alarming gaps in the vetting of Syrian refugees at home and abroad.\" Already, the new legislation was facing criticism from both sides of the aisle -- and not just the White House. Heritage Action executive officer Michael A. Needham said in a statement that the bill, while setting up better vetting, \"provides no leverage for Congress to weigh in and relies solely on President Obama's appointees to carry out the new vetting process.\" House Democrats also voiced opposition, with one House Democratic leadership aide telling Fox News the bill would \"end the refugee program altogether.\" The aide said they hope to \"negotiate a bipartisan bill\" and are weighing introducing an \"alternative bill.\" Meanwhile, CIA Director John Brennan said in a speech Wednesday that about half of Syria's population -- or about 12 million people -- has been displaced by the ISIS onslaught and the civil war, a number that includes both those who have been internally displaced and those forced to flee the country. Speaking at the Overseas Security Advisory Council Conference, Brennan said Syria is \"approaching 50 percent of the population\" that has been displaced.

            "article_content": "Oct. 14, 2016: These booking photos show, from left, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright, and Patrick Eurgene Stein. All three men have been charged with plotting to bomb an apartment building filled with Somali immigrants in Garden City, Kan. (Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office via AP) WICHITA, Kan.  \u2013 Three members of a Kansas militia group were charged Friday with plotting to bomb an apartment complex that's home to Somali immigrants in the western Kansas meatpacking town of Garden City, a thwarted attack prosecutors say was planned for the day after the November election. The arrests were the culmination of an eight-month FBI investigation that took agents \"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Tom Beall said. A complaint unsealed Friday charges Curtis Wayne Allen, 49; Patrick Eugene Stein, 47; and Gavin Wayne Wright, 49, with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. Their first court appearance is Monday. Prosecutors said the men don't yet have attorneys. Publicly listed phone numbers for the men couldn't immediately be found. The men are members of a small militia group that calls itself \"the Crusaders,\" and whose members espouse sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges group members chose the target based on their hatred for Muslims, people of Somali descent and immigrants -- and out of a desire to inspire other militia groups and \"wake people up.\" The FBI began a domestic terrorism investigation of the group in February, and a confidential source attended its meetings in southwestern Kansas. In a June meeting, Stein brought up the Orlando nightclub shooting, and proposed carrying out a similar attack against Muslim refugees in Garden City, according to the complaint. They ultimately decided to target the apartment complex because of the number of Somalis who lived there and the fact that one of the apartments was used as a mosque. The complex houses about 120 Somali residents, Beall said. The complaint said that Stein discussed the explosives used in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh. The men, who were arrested in Liberal on Friday morning, performed surveillance of the apartment building and prepared a manifesto, Beall said. In a profanity-laced conference call that law enforcement monitored, Stein said the only way \"this country's ever going to get turned around is it will be a bloodbath,\" according to the complaint. If convicted, the men could be sentenced to up to life in federal prison without parole. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, called the details of the plot disturbing, saying it \"should serve as a warning to those who traffic in the politics of fear and bigotry.\" Garden City is home to a Tyson Foods beef slaughterhouse that has drawn a diverse immigrant population to the area. Dr. John Birky, a physician who's helping to create a clinic and working with refugees on a language program, said some local residents fear the refugees, mistakenly associating them with militants in Somalia. \"People do express more of a general sentiment of, `Why are we letting these refugees in here? Why are we? They're taking our jobs, plus they're Muslim,\"' he said. Birky said between 300 and 500 Somali refugees live in the area. The state Department for Children and Families said that of the 906 refugees who arrived in Kansas from October 2014 through January 2016, 68 were from Somalia, or 7.5 percent. Garden City Mayor Chris Law said in a statement that he was shocked by the planned attack, and Birky called it \"crazy.\" Birky said most are fleeing militants in Somalia and want to assimilate once they reach Kansas. \"They're trying to make a better life for their families here,\" he said. \"They want to pursue the American dream.\" Friday's arrests and charges prompted the Council on American-Islamic Relations to call on state and federal law enforcement agencies across the nation to increase protection for mosques and other Islamic institutions. The group also cited reports of threats against a Michigan center and anti-Muslim graffiti at a New Jersey mosque. \"We ask our nation's political leaders, and particularly political candidates, to reject the growing Islamophobia in our nation,\" Nihad Awad, the group's national executive director, said in a statement. The case is the latest involving militia groups in the state. Earlier this year, a planned armed protest outside a Wichita mosque prompted the Islamic Society of Wichita to cancel an appearance by a speaker whom protesters believed supported terrorism. The Justice Department's National Security Division created a new position a year ago to help coordinate investigations into violent homegrown extremism, like the one that resulted in the three arrests.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Asserting a public demand for a greater measure of protection, Republicans are ready to push legislation through the House erecting fresh hurdles for Syrian and Iraqi refugees trying to enter the United States. President Barack Obama promised a veto. While many Democrats mocked the House effort as election-season grandstanding, political pressures were pushing others to support the measure or seek to change other entry procedures. \"We are a compassionate nation. We always have been, and we always will be,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \"But we also must remember that our first priority is to protect the American people.\" Republicans were bringing the bill to the House floor on Thursday, less than a week after a burst of bombings and shootings killed 129 people in Paris, wounded many more and revived post-9/11 jitters in the U.S. and other countries. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the massacres. The measure would require the FBI to conduct background checks on Syrian and Iraqi refugees. It would oblige the heads of the FBI and Homeland Security Department and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that each refugee \"is not a threat to the security of the United States.\" Republicans said the bill contained no religious tests for the refugees \u2014 a split from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, GOP presidential contenders who have suggested giving preferences to Christians. Democrats said the measure in effect targeted Muslims, who comprise the majority of Iraqis and Syrians. In a statement assuring a veto, the White House said the GOP bill would not improve Americans' security. It said the legislation \"would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.\" Currently, the refugee screening process typically takes 18 to 24 months and includes interviews, fingerprinting and database crosschecks by several federal agencies. Syrians undergo additional screening involving data from the U.N. Refugee Agency and interviews by Homeland Security Department officials trained to question Syrians. Republicans said that with Islamic State militants openly threatening to attack the U.S. in a recent video, that system isn't sufficient to ensure Americans that refugees entering the United States aren't extremists bent on attacking the country. \"The status quo is not acceptable,\" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who wrote the bill with Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C. \"The American people want us to act in light of what's happened.\" Several conservative Republicans said they'd support the House GOP bill but called it symbolic since Republicans lack the votes needed to override an Obama veto. Many of them are considering pushing the issue in a massive spending bill due by Dec. 11 \u2014 a measure that if vetoed would lead to a government shutdown. \"We don't have enough Democrats willing to protect American lives to override the veto,\" said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala. The Obama administration wants to increase the 70,000 refugees to be admitted from around the world this year by 10,000, with much of the increase for Syrians. The White House said that of 2,174 Syrians admitted to the U.S. since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, none has been arrested or deported because of allegations they harbored extremist ambitions. Democrats said the GOP legislation would in effect completely block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the country because officials cannot absolutely guarantee that they wouldn't be threats, and because it would take two years to install new procedures the bill would mandate. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said that with next year's presidential election approaching, Republicans were using the bill to show conservative voters that they want to \"keep away the foreign invaders.\" Even so, there were signs many Democrats felt uncomfortable flatly opposing the GOP effort. The 15-member Blue Dog Coalition of moderate Democrats said it would support the legislation. Rep Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., said the measure makes the system \"stronger and makes it safer for America to do the right thing by accepting legitimate refugees.\" Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, top Democrat on the Homeland Security panel, and other Democrats were proposing an alternative blocking admission for any refugees the government finds have not fully established their identity. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said they would introduce a bill restricting visas for any individuals who had been in Iraq or Syria in the past five years. ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) I keep hearing Ted Cruz conservatives dissing Donald Trump. I keep seeing the idiotic slogan #NeverTrump. I have a message for all of you: Stop your whining and childish hissy fits. Stop the distortions of Trump\u2019s record. Of course Trump is better than Hillary. Of course all Republicans need to unite behind Trump. Of course he\u2019s a conservative. I\u2019ll prove it to you. I\u2019m one of you. I\u2019m a true-blue lifelong conservative patriot. I\u2019ve been a \u201cCruz conservative\u201d my whole life. Except in my day it was called \u201cReagan conservative.\u201d My conservative credentials cannot be challenged. My parents were among the founders of the famous New York State conservative Party. My political career began at age 3 handing out literature for Barry Goldwater. I spent my youth working on political campaigns for victorious conservative heroes like U.S. Senator James Buckley, U.S. Senator Alphonse D\u2019Amato and President Ronald Reagan. I represented Reagan in the campus Presidential debate at Columbia University. I\u2019ve sacrificed my TV career being an outspoken conservative in Hollywood. My conservative beliefs have cost me millions of dollars. Enough credentials and credibility for you? So are you ready for my takeaway of all this? 1. Trump isn\u2019t just conservative. On important issues, he\u2019s the most conservative Presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan. 2. Trump is the perfect candidate to lead the conservative movement. 3. Trump is our generation\u2019s Reagan. How do I come to these conclusions? First, remember the famous saying \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d Please stop saying Trump isn\u2019t a conservative. He may not be a \u201cpure\u201d or perfect conservative. On that I agree. But his views on the important issues of our day drive liberals into fits of rage and insanity. Being Jewish, Ivy League educated and in the television and entertainment industries my whole life, I know a thing or two about liberals. I\u2019ve spent my whole life in liberal circles: Manhattan, Malibu, Hollywood, Columbia and Harvard. The last person I saw despised this much by liberals was Ronald Reagan. The similarities are remarkable. My hero Reagan drove liberals batty. He drove them into fits of apoplectic rage. Today I see the same reaction to Trump. Liberals hate Trump with such rage that they want to hurt him. They want to ruin him. They even openly want to see him assassinated. Or haven\u2019t you seen the thousands of online and social media comments from liberals hoping Trump gets shot? Or haven\u2019t you seen the cemetery headstone \u201cR.I.P. Donald Trump\u201d put up in New York\u2019s Central Park? Liberals call Trump the same names and descriptions as they used to call Reagan. They say he\u2019s an intellectual lightweight, clown, racist, extreme, stupid, ignorant, unqualified to be President, and of course, we can never allow his finger near the nuclear button. Don\u2019t forget \u201cHitler and Nazi.\u201d The exact same words that my ultra-liberal classmates at Columbia used to describe Reagan. So I ask you fellow conservatives\u2026isn\u2019t this a good sign? Shouldn\u2019t you like the guy that liberals hate? If they think Trump is a terrible person and bad for America, shouldn\u2019t you embrace him? If liberals despise Trump so much they are threatening to leave for Canada, shouldn\u2019t we all thank God for Trump and offer to pay for their plane tickets? \u201cThe enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d You may think Trump is not a conservative, but liberals are certain he\u2019s their enemy. They're sure certain he\u2019s a conservative. They\u2019re certain he\u2019s the worst thing since Reagan. That makes Trump my hero. That makes Trump one of my favorite conservative candidates of all time! Secondly, I agree Trump is not a pure or traditional conservative. That\u2019s why he can win this election vs Hillary Clinton. Again, this is where Trump intersects with Reagan. Reagan was an entertainer, showman and communicator, more than a conservative. Trump is the perfect mix to win this election- entertainer, showman, businessman, celebrity, reality TV star and our very own \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d He\u2019s exactly what the doctor ordered for conservatives. A pure conservative position on every issue is never going to win national elections in today\u2019s America. We need a conservative, mixed with populist and economic nationalist- always America first, presented \u00a0in a fun, entertaining way. That\u2019s Trump. Lastly we come to issues. I care about seven of them above all else. These are the seven issues that can instantly save America, capitalism, the U.S. economy and the middle class. Everything and anything else is a distraction, all other issues must be put on the back-burner. On these seven issues, Trump is as conservative as any candidate in modern history! These are the seven issues that matter above all others to this conservative and capitalist evangelist: 1. Taxes. Trump\u2019s flat tax plan lowers tax rates even lower than Reagan. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 2. Regulations. As a businessman I think regulations are even worse than taxes. Our entire economy and middle class jobs have been decimated by Obama\u2019s regulations. Trump is a businessman. He hates regulations. He\u2019ll dramatically reduce and cut regulations and regulatory agencies (like the EPA)\u00a0 in order to get the economy moving again. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 3. ObamaCare. Trump wants to repeal and replace Obamacare and give Americans more health freedom. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 4. Build the wall, secure the border and end sanctuary cities. Need I say more- this is Trump\u2019s signature issue. His views on illegal immigration define perfection. If he does nothing as president but stop the flow of illegal immigration, he\u2019ll be remembered as an American hero. Just this one point can save the American economy from bankruptcy, ruin and crippling debt crisis. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 5. Stop the insanity of allowing in thousands of Syrian refugees and Muslim migrants. Why is this so important? So that we don\u2019t become the EU- bankrupt, suffering crime and rape epidemics, and experiencing nonstop terrorist attacks. This view isn\u2019t just conservative- it\u2019s commonsense and self-preservation. FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 6. Always \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Every single policy- domestic, foreign, trade and immigration- should be based on what\u2019s best for America, American citizens, American taxpayers, and American jobs. I\u2019ve waited my entire life to hear these words come out of a potential president\u2019s mouth. The only job of an American president is to take care of America and Americans first, second, third and forever. How can you get more patriotic or conservative than that? FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. 7. Investigate and prosecute politicians who commit crimes against the American people. What if the only thing Trump accomplishes is clean up the D.C. cesspool, hold politicians accountable and bring criminals to justice? What if he sends Hillary to prison for her crimes? What if he prosecutes top IRS officials who targeted and persecuted conservatives? What if he prosecutes Obama\u2019s bundler Jon Corzine? What if he prosecutes everyone involved with the fraud of Obamacare? You mean that alone isn\u2019t worth the price of admission? FANTASTIC! PASSES THE CONSERVATIVE TEST. Yes, folks Donald Trump is a conservative. No, not a pure or perfect conservative. But on the issues that count most, he\u2019ll be the most conservative president since Reagan. How can I be so sure? Just mention Trump\u2019s name to any liberal and watch their reaction. So yes, I have a message for all Republicans and conservatives. Stop listening to the whiners, complainers and sore losers. Stop listening to establishment big shots angry that GOP voters told them to \u201cshove it where the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d Stop listening to consultants, strategists, lobbyists and donors angry that Trump has left them out of the game. Listen to me carefully Republicans... If you don't vote for Trump, you should never be trusted again.",

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (The Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 Mormons are gathering in Salt Lake City to listen to speeches from church leaders at a twice-yearly conference. More than 100,000 members of the faith are expected to attend five sessions in Salt Lake City that span Saturday and Sunday. Thousands more will listen or watch around the world on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' conference comes amid an intense presidential election in the U.S. and as members around the world grapple with the increasing needs of refugees. Church leaders could talk more about their push to be welcoming toward refugees at a time when some others are tightening the hatches. Mormon leaders sent a letter a year ago urging its members to help and launched a refugee relief effort campaign in March called \"I Was A Stranger.\" Last month, the church posted a new video on its website showing how members can mentor refugees. Mormon leaders are not expected to mention presidential candidates by name, but they could advocate again for public civility and compassion. Their mostly Republican members are trying to decide how to vote in November amid a general distaste for the brash Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump's inability to connect with Mormon voters has led to significantly fewer Latter-day Saints identifying as Republicans this year compared with four years ago when Mitt Romney, a Mormon himself, was the party's presidential nominee, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Leaders may also advocate for religious liberty protections, a popular topic in recent years for the faith. Mormon leaders have been preaching the importance of preserving religious liberty while also calling on members to accept and adhere to the legalization of same-sex marriage by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

All rights reserved.) In 2016 I wrote a book called \u201cAngry White Male.\" It had nothing to do with race. It was simply my personal testimony. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else. I am a S.O.B. -- son of a butcher. I was raised as a white, middle class kid in the greatest country in world history. I was taught by my wonderful, true red, white and blue, patriotic, salt-of-the-earth American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are: Faith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. Well, don\u2019t look now. Everything from that list above\u2026everything we believe in\u2026everything that made America great\u2026has been under full scale assault for eight long years -- from multiple directions. And Hillary Clinton is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama\u2019s third term. So\u2026we have only a few days left, before it\u2019s all over. The truth is, we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love...the America created by our Founding Fathers....is finished.\u00a0Forever. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I\u2019m not being hysterical. I\u2019m just explaining the facts. Trump is our last chance to turn it all around. It\u2019s Trump\u2026or\u00a0America continues a long decline towards the bottom. Because if Trump doesn\u2019t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before, to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great. Illegals immigrants no longer come here \"for a love of America.\" They come for a love of welfare, food stamps, housing allowances, free medical, free education, free meals at school, free English as second language classes\u2026and don\u2019t forget $3,000 welfare payments disguised as \"earned income tax credits,\" for people who paid no taxes. Illegals come here for the cradle to grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote for Democrats forever to keep the checks coming. That\u2019s Hillary\u2019s plan. Don\u2019t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks, train them to vote Democratic to keep the checks and handouts coming.\u00a0It worked! That was the experiment. Call it Plan A. Now Democrats are onto Plan B. The plan is to flood the country with illegals and foreigners who don\u2019t share our values or love of America. The plan is to turn the rest of America into California. Hillary will flood the country with millions more. Hillary will legalize the 15 million or so already here -- and give them the right to vote. Hillary will allow those 15 million to quickly and easily bring in millions of their relatives and friends. Hillary will also import millions of Muslim refugees -- people who will need instant welfare and food stamps, very few of whom speak our language, very few of whom believe in American exceptionalism, our Constitution, or Judeo-Christian values. This is the four-step plan. Then it\u2019s over for America. In four years we\u2019ll be\u00a0California-cated. We will never win a popular vote for president again. Donald Trump is our last chance to ever again elect a Republican president. It\u2019s Donald Trump\u2026or it\u2019s the end of the GOP on the national level\u2026and the end of America. So don\u2019t even think of staying home\u2026or taking a vacation\u2026or registering a \u201cprotest vote\u201d on Gary Johnson\u2026or Evan McMullen. Don\u2019t even think of staying home because you\u2019re a Christian and Trump is not your cup of tea. Think of the Supreme Court. Think of open borders. Think of millions of Muslim refugees imported by Hillary to turn America into Western Europe. Think of your children\u2019s future. Think of the future of your unborn grandchildren. Think of your job. Think of your middle class life. Think of ObamaCare expanded to single payer like bankrupt Europe. Think of capitalism, American exceptionalism, Judeo-Christian values. Think of this as the last time you can EVER elect a Republican. Think of this as Trump\u2026or the end of America. Then vote like you\u2019ve never voted before. Vote for Trump like...

General Assembly, called Tuesday for more global cooperation especially in helping refugees from war-torn countries \u2013 while making only passing reference to the Islamic State and the ever-expanding scourge of like-minded terror groups. The president called for a \u2018course correction\u2019 for globalization to ensure nations don't retreat into a more sharply divided world, while pushing back against an isolationist approach gaining popularity in many countries. He advocated for open democracies and open economies, while railing against the example set by Russia and calling for more tolerance in all nations. He also took what appeared to be a jab at Donald Trump, saying: \u2018The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall\u2019 and prevent extremism from affecting societies. With that message in hand, Obama urged nations to \u2018follow through even when the politics are hard,\u2019 in helping refugees fleeing conflict.\u201dTRUMP: U.S. MILITARY \u2018GANG THAT COULDN\u2019T SHOOT STRAIGHT\u2019 Donald Trump took American forces in Syria to task, calling the U.S. military \u201cthe gang that couldn\u2019t shoot straight\u201d over an airstrike on ISIS targets that also mistakenly killed a number of Syrian troops. In an interview Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump seemingly sided with the Kremlin on what has become a hot-button issue for U.S.-Russia relations, lamenting that \u201cRussia is absolutely furious at us.\u201d The strike marked the first known U.S. action against Putin-backed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s troops.FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH SAID TO BE VOTING AGAINST TRUMPBaltimore Sun: \u201cFormer Maryland Lt. Gov.\u00a0Kathleen Kennedy Townsend\u00a0said in a social media post on Monday that former President George H. W.\u00a0Bush\u00a0told her he is planning to break with his party to support Democrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0in November. \u2018The President told me he\u2019s voting for Hillary!!\u2019 Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and the eldest daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, wrote on Facebook under a picture of her shaking the president\u2019s hand. The post appears to have been removed since Politico first reported about it\u00a0on Monday night. Asked by The Baltimore Sun to confirm the exchange on Tuesday, Kennedy Townsend emailed back a single sentence: \u2018What was said was said.\u2019 \u2026Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush, said in a statement that the president is not commenting on the race. \u2018The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,\u2019 he said.\u201dTrump praises Christie despite new scandal claims - Donald Trump is sticking by Gov. Chris Christie even in light of allegations the New Jersey governor knew of the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. At Monday\u2019s trial of two former members of Christie\u2019s administration, prosecutors rejected Christies public claim that he had been in the dark about the retributive snarling of traffic for the town of Fort Lee, N.J. -- a punishment for a mayor who refused to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection in 2013. Trump, who had previously accused Christie of lying about his ignorance, made a statement to the NYT about Christie who is now leading Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cAfter [Christie\u2019s] recent run for president, he called me to say that he would like to endorse me in that he sees a movement like he has never seen before,\u201d Trump told the paper, \u201cI was greatly honored, accepted his endorsement, and he has been a spectacular advocate ever since.\u201dTHE RULEBOOK: IT\u2019S \u2018WE THE PEOPLE\u2019 FOR A REASON\u201cThe adversaries of the Constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on [state vs. federal government]; and to have viewed these different establishments, not only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other.

These pigeons were living in a lab in New Zealand where, over a span of two years, they learned to distinguish four-letter English words from nonsense words. For their training, a computer screen would flash words like \u2018DOWN\u2019 or \u2018GAME,\u2019 and non-words like \u2018TWOR\u2019 or \u2018NELD,\u2019 along with a star symbol.

I didn't do this to be controversial. I didn't do this to stir the pot,\" she says. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) (The Associated Press) MISSOULA, Mont. \u2013 For the world, the photograph of a Syrian 3-year-old in a red T-shirt and black sneakers, his lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach, was a horrific symbol of the desperation of hundreds of thousands of refugees. For Mary Poole, a young mother haunted by \"those little shoes ... the little face,\" it was an inspiration. She and members of her book club asked: Why not bring a small number of Syrian families to Missoula? She knows now that this was a \"romantic\" notion. \"It wasn't even a grain of sand in my brain that people wouldn't want to help starving, drowning families. I didn't do this to be controversial. I didn't do this to stir the pot.\" But it did. And what started as a disagreement over whether to welcome dozens of refugees to this peaceful corner of western Montana soon erupted into something much larger, encompassing wildly divergent views of Islam, big government and whether Americans should \"take care of our own\" before worrying about newcomers. Neighboring counties \u2014 and in some cases, neighbors \u2014 locked horns. Demonstrators took to the streets: \"No Jobs, No Housing, No Free Anything,\" proclaimed some opponents' signs. Some warned that Islamic State terrorists could infiltrate their communities; others suggested that the federal government, long accused of tyranny in its dealings with the West, was at it again. The refugees' supporters did not back off. \"Rise Above Fear, Refugees Welcome\" they declared. Missoula's mayor, John Engen, was among them. \"I think that the war on terror has produced an internal war on compassion,\" he says. \"We have been programmed to be very afraid since 9/11 and to think of people who aren't white Anglo-Saxon Americans as 'other' and we should be afraid of people who are 'other.'\" This did not occur in a vacuum. What's happened here reflects what's happening across the nation in an election year dominated by inflammatory rhetoric over immigration, including calls for building a border wall, the mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the U.S. And more generally, Montanans are like other Americans who ask: How are we to live together, as one nation, when we are so estranged? At a time when the public is polarized over issues ranging from gay marriage to guns, the Rev. Joseph Carver, pastor at St. Francis Xavier Parish, sees this as just another \"incarnation of the larger divide in the country.\" His congregation, which gathers in a towering 124-year-old brick structure with frescoes, ornate scroll work, is overwhelmingly in favor of refugees. Carver, like others here, believes the spark that ignited this conflict is fear. \"Refugees,\" he declares, \"are seen as a threat to our way of life.\" Montana is a place of great beauty, with its snow-capped mountains, Ponderosa pines, bighorn sheep, bison and elk. Fly fishermen reel in trout from shimmering streams. College kids can be spotted kayaking on the Clark Fork River on cool spring nights. And a bookstore owner can point to the park down the street where a moose is known to frequent. It is not, however, a diverse place. Though the sparsely populated state is home to seven Indian reservations, nearly nine of 10 residents are white, according to Census figures. Only about 2 percent are foreign-born. Since 2012, the state has welcomed just 13 refugees from Cuba and Iraq, according to officials. But Missoula, site of a World War II detention center for Japanese-Americans, Italian merchant seamen and others, has a recent history of embracing refugees. The International Rescue Committee resettled the Hmong in the late 1970s and through the 1980s; some remain as farmers. Later, another agency brought Ukrainians and Belarusians here. With its coffee houses, murals and bike trails, Missoula has a laid-back feel. It is home to the University of Montana, as well as a peace center named for Jeannette Rankin, a pacifist who was the first woman member of Congress \u2014 and the only vote against declaring war on Japan after the Pearl Harbor attack. The center's philosophy is captured on a wall lined with bumper stickers \u2014 \"Peace is Patriotic,\" ''Books Not Bombs\" and \"Practice Nonviolence\" \u2014 and a stenciled message on a front window: \"Refugees Welcome.\" When Poole, a jewelry maker, and others formed a group called Soft Landing, they quickly expanded their plan to include not just Syrians but all refugees and turned to the International Rescue Committee to lead the resettlement. Their efforts were endorsed by the mayor, most council members and the three Democratic county commissioners, who sent letters to federal officials. But Missoula is an island of progressive blue surrounded by a sea of conservative red, and often diverges politically from other communities in Montana. Just to the south, in rural and Republican Ravalli County, a county commissioners' hearing over the issue was moved to a middle school gym to accommodate the hundreds who showed up for what turned into a raucous meeting. Several pro-refugee speakers were jeered .The commissioners formalized their opposition in their own letter to federal officials \u2014 and Flathead County, nearly 130 miles north of Missoula, did the same weeks later. In testimony and letters in Ravalli County, those saying \"no\" outlined their objections. They argued that Muslims or others from the Middle East could create the kind of chaos seen in Europe, impose an enormous tax burden and wouldn't be able to assimilate because they don't share American values. Many said their biggest fear was the U.S. government couldn't conduct adequate screening. Some spoke of apocalyptic visions of terrorists posing as refugees making their way to the quiet countryside. \"There's no 800 number you can call into Morocco or Libya or any one of those places ... and say, 'Can you check the identity of this person?' Without the ability to properly vet them, it's literally putting Americans' lives at risk,\" says Eli Anselmi, who felt compelled to write a letter even though he lives three hours away in Bozeman. The risk may be minimal, he says, but the potential harm is great. \"Let's say that you have a bowl of M&Ms ... and there are two that have cyanide. Will you eat from that bowl?\" Ray Hawk, a Ravalli County commissioner, has similar worries. \"These are folks that have declared war on the United States,\" he says. \"Their war is terrorism and that's the way they're going to do it. And I don't feel that we need to give them that chance. Now, if the government gets a handle on this thing and has a way to vet these people, I'm all for them. I love to see anybody come into America and succeed.\" Supporters of the refugees weighed in with reminders of America's tradition of providing sanctuary to those who've fled war and oppression; some cited their own family history. They spoke of empathy, pointed to a lengthy screening process and noted the other refugees who resettled here successfully in recent decades. Shawn Wathen, a bookstore owner in Ravalli County, was appalled his 18-year-old son was booed when he testified in support of the refugees and then later cursed by some opponents. Wathen wrote the commissioners, accusing them of \"xenophobic grandstanding.\" One replied that he was \"ignorant.\" Wathen, who has called the sprawling Bitterroot Valley home for 20 years, sees the rejection of refugees as a blend of misinformation, economic anxiety and fear of the unknown. \"It surpasses any notion of reason ... that kind of idea that they are not us, and therefore they pose a threat,\" he says. \"There's just that sense the horde is out there and if we don't circle the wagons ... we're going to be overrun and poor white America is going to suffer.\" America has a long history of wariness of refugees. Last November, shortly after the Paris terrorist attacks, a Gallup poll found that Americans, by 60 to 37 percent, opposed taking in refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. In 1978, there was a 57 to 32 percent opposition to accepting Indochinese boat people, and in 1946, after World War II, the public was against welcoming displaced people from Europe, including Jews, by 72 to 16 percent. Generally, Americans tend to favor refugees with whom they share some connection \u2014 political, religious or personal \u2014 and the public has little interaction with Muslims, says David Haines, a professor emeritus at George Mason University who has written extensively about refugees. He says the public doesn't understand the rigorous vetting process. \"The risks from refugees are really low because it's an extremely well-screened population,\" he says. \"But it's hard for people to settle down on this issue, especially in a highly politicized context.\" In Missoula, academics and religious leaders have expressed alarm about the harsh tone of the presidential campaign, especially comments aimed at Muslims by Donald Trump. In April, they sponsored \"Celebrate Islam Week\" at the university in hopes of countering the trend. Among the participants was Samir Bitar, an Arabic studies professor who arrived at the University of Montana in the 1970s as a 16-year-old freshman, raised a family and has spent most of his adult life here. Bitar has lectured for decades across the state without controversy \u2014 until this year, when about a dozen people in the nearby town of Darby objected to his planned talk at the library. The reason: They didn't want a Muslim in their town, according to the librarian. The library board voted. Bitar spoke and received a warm reception. But the tone and atmosphere are decidedly different now, he says. \"This is the first time I actually look behind me as I walk. I've been here 42 years,\" he says. \"It's like every part of my identity is coming under attack, including my American identity.\" Recently, two students accepted Bitar's challenge to walk around wearing Muslim head gear to see how people would react. One young man donned a kufi, or skull cap, and classmates wouldn't sit next to him, Bitar says. While working at a deli, the student was rebuffed by a customer's wife who said: \"'We're not going to have a Muslim help us.'\" Bitar, who is Palestinian, finds it all disheartening. People now are \"motivated by pure emotion and not really thinking in logical terms,\" he says. \"Fear turns into hatred.\" Jameel Chaudhry, the campus architect, a native of Kenya and another member of the small Muslim community, says he, too, senses a new hostility. \"All of a sudden WE are the problem,\" he says. \"We've never had this before, and I've been here 20 years. We didn't have this even after 9/11.\" Chaudhry attributes this attitude to Trump, accusing the presumptive Republican nominee of stoking fears for political gain. \"He's become the champion of the anti-Muslim, anti-refugee movement,\" he says. While that group talks of being tired of political correctness, Chaudhry sees something else: \"They don't want the other races coming in here.\" But those who've publicly spoken out against refugees bristle at suggestions they're racist. They say they're trying to protect their communities. \"It doesn't make any difference if they're Muslims, Russians, whatever. You have to know who they are, what they've been doing in the past,\" says Jim Buterbaugh, a construction worker who organized three opposition rallies, including one at the state Capitol. \"Are you going to go downtown and take five people off the streets and move them into your house without knowing who they are? Nobody in their right mind would do that.\" He and others are upset they have no vote on this issue. State and local governments legally don't have authority to bar refugees, though they can refuse to directly provide local services, according to Haines. Last fall, more than half the nation's governors declared their opposition to accepting Syrian refugees, saying a pause was needed until security concerns are addressed. That sense of being shut out of decision-making reflects a wider distrust of the government in parts of the West, where federal policies involving land, water and endangered species often clash with energy, timber and grazing interests. Though the refugee debate is different, it exposes the same raw nerves among opponents, who also question the economic and social impact. In a letter to her commissioners, Ravalli County resident Birte Nellessen said, \"to fool ourselves that we are helping 'poor folks driven out of their homeland by war' is ridiculous. They openly and blazingly state that they are coming to destroy us and our culture. ... Why we would spend any of our hard earned money on people like that?\" Nellessen, who moved to the U.S. from Germany 20 years ago, says officials should instead support local folks in need and that a smarter course would be to send supplies or money to help refugees rebuild in their homeland. \"I mean, what's a Syrian or Kenyan going to do in winter in Montana? Seriously.\" The answer is coming. The International Rescue Committee has met with Missoula's mayor, police chief and others to prepare for the refugees \u2014 about 100 will come over a year's time. The agency plans to reopen a resettlement office here this fall, after a 25-year absence. Those most likely to be relocated include Congolese, Afghans and Syrians who will have no family ties, so they'll have to live within a 50-mile radius of the office. Mary Poole is looking forward to their arrival. About 750 people have signed up to help refugees make the transition, she says. One former Missoula resident now living in Mongolia wants to get involved when she returns. Poole is already thinking ahead, too, about how this could change the life of her 17-month-old son, Jack. She envisions a day, she says, when he \"will be able to sit in a school next to someone of a different color, of a different language, of a different culture \u2014 and be able to learn that he lives in a global world. ... I don't think we can be insulated anymore.\" Poole knows resistance remains, and still meets with those who don't want refugees here. She says she's even made friends with some vocal opponents, recently inviting them to her house for a barbecue. \"We're asking for compassion,\" she says, \"and must be able to give that ourselves.\" And there's always a chance to win some over. \"They are us,' she says of the opponents. \"They are part of our community, and in order for this to be as successful as it possibly can be, it's about being in it together.\" ___ Sharon Cohen, a Chicago-based national writer, can be reached at scohen@ap.org",

The list is meant to reassure conservatives that his picks would be in line with their positions and help allay lingering reservations. Top picks include conservative federal and state judges like Steven Colloton of Iowa, Allison Eid of Colorado and Raymond Gruender of Missouri. Also on the list are: Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, Joan Larsen of Michigan, Thomas Lee of Utah, William Pryor of Alabama, David Stras of Minnesota, Diane Sykes of Wisconsin and Don Willett of Texas. Trump had previously named Pryor and Sykes as examples of kind of justices he would choose. The news comes as Trump is working to bring together a fractured Republican Party and earn the trust of still-skeptical establishment Republicans who question his electability in the general election, as well as conservatives in his party still wary of his commitment to their cause. In a statement, Trump said the list \"is representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value\" and said that, as president, he would use it \"as a guide to nominate our next United States Supreme Court Justices.\" His campaign stressed the list was compiled \"first and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican Party leadership.\" In an interview Wednesday night with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump said he wants people of \"high intellect\" on his list to replace the seat held by Scalia. \"I have a lot of people that are conservative that really like me, love everything I stand for, but they really would like to know my view because perhaps outside of the defense of our country, perhaps the single most important thing the next president is going to have to do is pick Supreme Court justices,\" he told Hannity. Larsen, who serves on the Michigan Supreme Court and is a former law clerk to Scalia, delivered one of the tributes to the late justice at his memorial service in March. She served in the Justice Department office that produced the legal justifications for the enhanced interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, that critics have called torture. Willett, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, is perhaps best known for his heavy use of social media. His Twitter handle, (at)justicewillett, has more than 35,000 followers. Willett however has repeatedly mocked Trump on Twitter. \"We'll rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing, believe me. And the rebels will pay for it.\"\u2014Darth Trump pic.twitter.com/y25LADg15J Pryor was initially given a recess appointment to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by President George W. Bush. Senate Democrats had tried to block Pryor's appointments over his strong criticism of the Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman's right to an abortion. Apart from Sykes, who is 58, the others all are younger than 55 and David Stras is just 41. The eight men and three women on the list are all white. Trump's list is also notable for the names that don't appear. It omits two of the biggest stars in the conservative legal world, Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the federal appeals court in Washington, and former Bush administration Solicitor General Paul Clement. Trump first said in March that he planned to release the list of five to 10 judges in an effort to ease concerns about his conservative credentials, which had come under attack in the heated Republican primary. \"I am going to give a list of either five or 10 judges that I will pick, 100 percent pick, that I will put in for nomination. Because some of the people that are against me say: `We don't know if he's going to pick the right judge. Supposing he picks a liberal judge or supposing he picks a pro-choice judge,\"' Trump said at an event in Palm Beach, Florida. He said then the list would include judges \"that everybody respects, likes and totally admires\" -- \"great conservative judges, great intellects, the people that you want.\" The vow marked a rare moment of acknowledgment by Trump that he could be doing more to appease those in his party opposed his candidacy. Trump had said he would like to appoint judges in the mold of deeply conservative as Scalia, who died in February. In the statement, he described Scalia as \"a remarkable person and a brilliant Supreme Court Justice.\" \"His career was defined by his reverence for the Constitution and his legacy of protecting Americans' most cherished freedoms,\" he added. \"He was a justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the Constitution of our country.\" \u201cDonald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees are a woman\u2019s worst nightmare,\" Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America said in a statement. \"His vision appears to be turning the court into an ideological instrument instead of an arbiter of the bedrock values of our country -justice, freedom, and equality.\" The Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life non-profit, called Trump's list an \"exceptionally strong list of jurists with immense respect for our founding documents.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump answers a question during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (Joe Raedle/Pool via AP) Earlier this year Ahmad Rahami, a naturalized American from Afghanistan, allegedly detonated several bombs in New York and New Jersey. Luckily, these attacks only wounded 31 people. This is but one example of the reality that America is fighting for its life, but most do not understand the gravity of the challenges we face. In fact, the United States is fighting for its existence on three fronts: economic, cultural and physical. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the situation: \u2022 Economic: GDP growth is stagnant at about 1 percent. It should be 3-4 percent. \u2022 Cultural: The American Constitution and way of life are under constant attack from enemies determined to destroy our liberties and our lives. \u2022 Physical: On national security, countless state and non-state actors are working to disrupt our day-to-day existence. We are exposed on all three fronts because political, business and cultural leaders are either na\u00efve, willfully blind or corrupt and complicit in flatlining the economy, allowing our traditions to be trampled over and making our citizens vulnerable to attack. The people who have created this dire situation believe in one or more of these four false narratives: globalism, socialism, isolationism and \u201cPolitical Islam.\u201d The first three narratives have been in the American mainstream for decades, but political Islam is different. Under the guise of a religion, political Islam has penetrated our culture, politics and media. \u201cPolitical Islam\u201d refers to the politicization of Islam. It preaches hate. It demands that non-Muslims must be killed or submit to Islamic law. It calls for global rule and it uses physical, intellectual, financial, legal and demographic means to attain it. To save America and Western civilization, we must defeat Political Islam. We must commit ourselves to destroying the forces that attack us every minute of every day. Here are several policies that would return America to leadership in the world: On the economic front: The government must get out of the way. We must reduce the tax burden on every American citizen and business. All wages should be taxed together under three brackets of 10, 20 and 30 percent. The corporate tax rate should be 20 percent, not 35 percent, which is the highest rate in the developed world. ObamaCare must be repealed and replaced with a plan that increases choice, keeps the government out of the physician-patient relationship and doesn\u2019t crush small businesses. We must stop the government\u2019s intergenerational theft, or our children and grandchildren will never be able to repay the current level of overspending. Lastly, all states must enact energy and right-to-work policies to allow for innovation and investment. On the cultural front: Adherence to core values made America strong. The U.S. must re-instill the values of the Founding Fathers: liberty and opportunity on top of a strong Judeo-Christian base. We must return to the constitutionally dictated balance of power shared by the three branches of government. To revive American exceptionalism, we must defend our freedom of speech against the false narrative of political correctness. Voter fraud must be eliminated. To ensure the integrity of our elections, Americans must be required to have photo identification when going to the ballot box. On the physical front: We must defeat the four leading Political Islamic terror organizations: Shiite Iran, ISIS/al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabism/Salafism. These entities indiscriminately terrorize and kill Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus and all others. In fact, Muslims are the No. 1 victims of Political Islam, as evidenced in Syria, Iraq and Iran. The ideology that feeds these entities must be debunked, and their leaders must be removed. Defeating them must begin by stopping Iran\u2019s radicalism and nuclear agenda, eliminating ISIS/al-Qaeda by any means necessary, rooting out the Muslim Brotherhood in any country where it operates and pressuring Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and Pakistan to reform the jihadist Wahhabism/Salafism ideology. To protect the homeland, we must screen all refugees and immigrants, seal our borders and secure our critical infrastructure by protecting the electric grid from natural disasters, cyber/GPS hacking and electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) attack. The American voter should keep these core issues in mind as we vote on November 8!",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate the war in Syria, Russia and defeating ISIS The second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis was do or die for Donald Trump; against all odds he survived to fight another day. Dead on arrival, however, was any pretense of civility between Hillary Clinton and her GOP opponent. In the wake of the damaging tape which revealed Trump boasting about his sexual assaults on women, a smug Hillary Clinton refused to shake hands with her opponent as they gathered at Washington University. She called Trump unfit for the presidency and on numerous occasions she accused him of lying. He countered by suggesting that if he were elected, she would go to jail. Given the preceding two days of all-out assault on Trump, his ability to rally and put Hillary on the defensive allowed him to declare victory and regain some lost ground. To the delight of his followers, Trump put Hillary on the griddle for much of the evening. He deftly parried questions about his crude misogynist remarks by saying he was embarrassed by them and had apologized. He then quickly pivoted to a sustained attack on Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment and record. To the delight of his followers, Trump put Hillary on the griddle for much of the evening. He deftly parried questions about his crude misogynist remarks by saying he was embarrassed by them and had apologized. He then quickly pivoted to a sustained attack on Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment and record. During the 90-minute town-hall style gathering moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, Trump managed to cite Hillary\u2019s destruction of emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, her ignoring of the 600 pleas for help from Chris Stevens, our ambassador who was killed at Benghazi, her enthusiasm for admitting Syrian refugees into the country despite security concerns, her wavering support of the TPP, the leaked tapes that reveal her inclination to say one thing in private and another in public, Obamacare\u2019s failings and so forth. In short, he did what he had failed to do in the first debate: remind Americans of what they do not like about Hillary Clinton. He also, remarkably, moved past the incriminating tape, leaving a sputtering Hillary in the rear view mirror. Given the near-hysteria with which the media had fastened on the recording of Trump boasting about fondling women against their wishes, and the outrage expressed by many across the political spectrum, Mrs. Clinton might have expected that Trump would be in retreat, and that the hall of spectators would be on her side. Not so. The first applause of the evening, which the moderators had warned against, met Trump\u2019s assertion that Hillary Clinton had demeaned and attacked the women who had accused husband Bill of sexual assault or rape. Trump had invited four of those women to participate in a press conference before the debate, signaling that he was ready to give as good as he got. He did just that and at least some in the Washington University hall seemed to approve his calling the Clintons out for hypocrisy. That wasn\u2019t the only issue on which he attacked Hillary. He brought up the dirty tricks campaign waged against Bernie Sanders by Clinton in cahoots with the Democratic National Committee; Hillary dove for cover behind the narrative that Putin is trying to upset our election to benefit Trump. He discussed her speeches to donors wherein she notes the advantage of having one position in public and another in private; in one of the more peculiar rebuttals of the evening, Clinton (as the Donald described it) blamed Abraham Lincoln. As opposed to the first debate, Trump seemed sure of his ground \u2013 able to discuss law and order, the inner city blight, tax proposals, our low growth rate, the failures of Obamacare, the Iran deal, and the current administration\u2019s hostility to our energy industry \u2013 and called her out for her \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d remark. On numerous occasions he said of Clinton: \u201cshe\u2019s all talk and no action.\u201d With 63 percent of the country saying we are on the wrong track, Trump making himself the candidate of change and charging Hillary with being the defender of the Status Quo is powerful; that\u2019s what he needed to do. As before, Trump\u2019s weakest performance (and Hillary\u2019s strongest) was in dealing with questions about foreign policy. When asked what he would do about the humanitarian disaster in Aleppo, Trump faltered. He shifted the conversation to Mosul, and reiterated his charge that our military is doing badly in its fight against ISIS, but proffered no serious solutions. Clinton repeated her insistence on a \u201cno-fly\u201d zone and said she would target ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, suggesting she had used similar tactics in fighting Al-Qaeda and reminding the audience of her experience in that realm. Hillary touted her background not only in traveling the world and fighting terror but also her lifelong commitment to children and families. This is her best resume item, but Trump undermined her recital by pointing out that she had failed to bring jobs to New York State, a pivotal pledge from her time as senator. Both candidates were asked what kind of judge they might appoint to the Supreme Court. Hillary channeled Barack Obama, who memorably went looking for \u201cempathy\u201d and apparently found that quality in Sonia Sotomayor. Clinton scored some points by saying she would look for a justice who would support Roe vs. Wade and marriage equality. She waded into deep water saying she would also appoint someone who would overturn Citizens United, and get dark money out of politics. That was a mistake. Clinton is the master at sucking up dark money, and has built a war chest several times the size of Trump\u2019s by \u201cdoing an end-run around contribution limits,\u201d as the New York Times recently reported. Trump said he would appoint someone like Scalia, who would defend the Constitution of the United States. He got another jab in by saying his pick for the Court would, unlike Hillary\u2019s likely choice, stand up for the second amendment. The debate in St. Louis was not a confrontation that made either candidate look noble or appealing. Trump, however, picked himself up off the mat and proved he is still in the race to win. If this election comes down to voters deciding whom they\u2019d rather have a beer with, the temperance movement may get a second life.",

            "article_content": "GOP nominee weighs in on 'Fox & Friends' Donald Trump revived his calls for tightening immigration following a rapid-fire succession of terror attacks involving foreign-born suspects spanning from Minnesota to New York and New Jersey, describing the threat as \u201ccancer from within.\u201d The Republican presidential nominee, in an interview Monday morning with Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d pointed to the latest threat in doubling down on his criticism of his Democratic opponent wanting to boost refugee admissions. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people,\u201d Trump said. Trump has called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for U.S.-bound immigrants and for a temporary suspension of all immigration from certain countries with a history of terror \u2013 proposals his critics have blasted as overly broad. The Obama administration, meanwhile, wants to boost the total number of refugees to the U.S. next year to 110,000, a nearly 30 percent increase. Clinton specifically wants to increase the number of Syrian refugee admissions from 10,000 to 65,000. Trump questioned whether refugees can be property vetted. Clinton also addressed the attacks, speaking to reporters Monday on the tarmac at Westchester Airport in New York. \u201cThis threat is real, but so is our resolve,\u201d Clinton said. She said she supports \u201ctough vetting\u201d but noted that millions of \u201claw-abiding\u201d Muslims and other naturalized citizens are in the country. \u201cLet us be vigilant, but not afraid,\u201d she said. Investigators are still looking for answers about the individuals involved in the attacks and explosions over the weekend. Authorities have taken into custody 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan. Rahami was wanted for questioning in the weekend explosion in a Manhattan neighborhood that injured 29 people. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceded Monday that investigators could no longer rule out international terrorism. Authorities were still working to determine whether there is a connection between multiple explosive devices found over the weekend in two states: the Manhattan explosion, an unexploded pressure cooker device blocks away, a pipe bomb blast at a Jersey shore town and five explosive devices at a New Jersey train station. Further, a young Somali man went on a stabbing spree Saturday in St. Cloud, Minn., injuring eight people \u2013 the Islamic State claimed responsibility via ISIS-related media. The attacker was shot and killed by an off-duty officer. Clinton, for her part, issued a statement Sunday afternoon condemning the \u201capparent terrorist attacks in Minnesota, New Jersey and New York.\u201d \u201cI pray for all of those who were wounded, and for their families. Once again, we saw the bravery of our first responders who run toward danger to help others. Their quick actions saved lives,\u201d she said. \u201cLaw enforcement officials are working to identify who was behind the attacks in New York and New Jersey and we should give them the support they need to finish the job and bring those responsible to justice -- we will not rest until that happens. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack in Minnesota, and this should steel our resolve to protect our country and defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups.\u201d Clinton cited her \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d for confronting the terror threat, including \u201claunching an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out, and to spot lone wolf attackers.\u201d She said the U.S. also needs to \u201cwork with Silicon Valley to counter propaganda and recruitment efforts online.\u201d Trump also complained Monday that police are \u201cafraid\u201d to act to stop these kinds of plots because they don\u2019t want to be accused of profiling. \u201cWe\u2019re not winning the war, they\u2019re winning the war,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 This is only going to get worse,\u201d he said. Trump took to Twitter to decry the current administration\u2019s record on thwarting terror attacks, saying it\u2019s \u201ctime to change the playbook.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (The Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 The Latest on a Mormon conference in Salt Lake City (all times local): 12:05 p.m. A Mormon leader is cautioning members not to succumb to rebellion, which would keep them out of heaven. J. Devn Cornish of the faith's second-tier of worldwide leaders spoke Saturday during a church conference in Salt Lake City about sin and repentance. Cornish said members can be forgiven for sins if they sincerely repent, but reminded that consequences of their actions sometimes linger. He spoke sternly about rebellion, saying Satan was cast of heaven for rebelling. He also told members that \"the worst kind of sin is premeditated sin where one says, I can sin now and repent later.'\" Cornish delivered his speech during a twice-yearly conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in which leaders provide spiritual instruction and guidance to members in attendance or watching live broadcasts. ____ 11:15 a.m. A Mormon leader is urging members of the Utah-based religion not to be timid about defending church founder Joseph Smith's story. Craig Christensen of the faith's second-tier of worldwide leaders spoke Saturday during a church conference in Salt Lake City about members struggling with \"erroneous, misleading or superficial information\" about Smith. He told members to remember the many benefits that have come in the nearly 200 years since Smith, then a teenager, says he had a vision of God and Jesus Christ in the woods of upstate New York that led to the formation of the church 10 years later. Christensen didn't reference any specific misinformation about Smith, though critics have long questioned Smith's accounts of his visions and his account that God helped him translate gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian into the Book of Mormon. Leaders give speeches of spiritual guidance and sometimes announce new church initiatives during the twice-yearly conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'. ____ 12:11 a.m. Mormons are gathering in Salt Lake City to listen to speeches from church leaders at a twice-yearly conference. More than 100,000 members of the faith are expected to attend five sessions in Salt Lake City that span Saturday and Sunday. Thousands more will listen or watch around the world on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' conference comes amid an intense presidential election in the U.S. and as members around the world grapple with the increasing needs of refugees. Church leaders could talk more about their push to be welcoming toward refugees at a time when some others are tightening the hatches. Mormon leaders are not expected to mention presidential candidates by name, but they could advocate again for public civility and compassion.",

            "article_content": "Republican vice-presidential nominee Gov. Mike Pence, right, and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine debate during the vice-presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016. (Andrew Gombert/Pool via AP) In the canine world, Mike Pence would be the Standard Poodle and Tim Kaine the yappy Chihuahua. Republican Vice Presidential candidate Pence was dignified, smart and likeable during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, while opponent Kaine was jumpy and annoying. But the differences went beyond style. Kaine presented a mini-me version of the Hillary Clinton campaign, focused on slamming and demeaning Donald Trump. Pressed to tell voters how his running mate would improve the lives of everyday Americans or rectify the mess she helped create in Syria, Kaine resorted to what Pence correctly described as the \u201cinsult-driven\u201d campaign. While Pence delivered concrete ideas and policies, Kaine fell back on well-practiced one-liners which, oft-repeated, began to sound silly; it turns out you can actually practice too much. But then there is not much substance to the Clinton campaign. When challenged on her lack of accomplishments as Secretary of State, Tim Kaine offered up the killing of Usama bin Laden. When asked how she might make the world safer, he offered up the killing of Usama bin Laden. When asked about temperament and credentials, Kaine volunteered the killing of Usama bin Laden. I could be wrong but I\u2019m pretty sure bin Laden only died once, and that Hillary had virtually nothing to do with it. True, she didn\u2019t throw herself in the way of the military personnel directing the mission and refuse to let them go forward. Instead, she was in the room consuming oxygen and converting it into CO2. Like a lot of other people. Kaine attempted throughout the evening to put Pence on the defensive over some of the more incendiary comments made over the past year by running mate Trump; Pence skillfully avoided being drawn into a pointless controversy. He also managed to avoid blaming the media for its unprecedented assault on a national candidate. That would have played well to Trump followers, but Pence did not need to go there. Instead, he went where few have dared to tread \u2013 into a heartfelt conversation about faith and abortion, without a doubt convincing anyone who was watching that he believed in the sanctity of life, and would try to persuade others to forego abortion in favor of adoption. He also criticized Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine for their support of partial-birth abortion, and good for him. Most of the country agrees the practice is heinous, but the pro-choice crowd goes along with it under cover of \u201cslippery slope\u201d concerns. No, it should be banned and Pence was totally credible on the topic. Pence also managed to do what Trump conspicuously failed to do in the first presidential debate \u2013 go after the numerous scandals that have destroyed the country\u2019s confidence in the credibility of Hillary Clinton. He reminded viewers of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s role as Bill and Hillary\u2019s political handmaiden\u00a0 and the apparent pay-to-play activities of Clinton while she served as Secretary of State. He also got in some zingers about the Clinton 30,000 emails that were destroyed. Asked how his ticket would get tough on Russia, Kaine trotted out (numerous times) the absurd charge that Trump is a fan of Vladimir Putin. (Yes, Trump has noted that Putin, head of a failing state, has enormously high approval ratings. He has also noted that by comparison President Obama looks and is toothless, as Russia elbows the U.S. out of Syria. ) Pence failed to note that Hillary Clinton enabled the Russians to take over half of America\u2019s uranium supplies, while accepting substantial donations from the purchaser into the Clinton Foundation. But he had plenty of material to charge Hillary as corrupt and, as Secretary of State, inconsequential. Pence made mincemeat out of the Iran deal; Kaine parried that one official in Israel thought it was helpful. Pence noted that Kaine had boycotted Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress; Kaine squirmed. Kaine said blocking refugees by country was unconstitutional; Pence rightly noted that was not true. Pence talked about the ground lost in Iraq under Obama and Clinton\u2019s failed policies \u2013 ground won through the sacrifice of American soldiers. Kaine parried by lauding the Iran deal. Oops; American fourth-graders know the nuke deal with Tehran is already falling apart and that a desperate President Obama was taken for a ride by the mullahs. And then he mentioned the killing of Usama bin Laden. And so it went, with Pence combing the fertile fields of Clintonian hypocrisy and scandal, and with Kaine trying to remember the best insults his team has launched against Trump. Perhaps the best line of the night was on the topic of Hillary\u2019s \u201ccareless\u201d handling of classified information. He said, as one father of a military man to another: \u201cIf your son or mine had done this, he would have been court martialed.\u201d Just so. The vice presidential candidates are more than nominally important in this election. Both candidates are long in the tooth, and Hillary Clinton, in particular, has suffered some health problems. It is not far-fetched to imagine that either Tim Kaine or Mike Pence could someday have to take over as president. Based on Tuesday night\u2019s performance, only Mike Pence is up to the task.",

Current government funding runs out Wednesday at midnight and Congress may need to pass another short-term extension of a day or two before striking a final agreement and leaving for the holiday break. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 Congressional leaders are girded to push a Christmas compromise on tax cuts and spending through the House and Senate by week's end after Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on a legislative package extending dozens of tax breaks for businesses and families and financing 2016 government operations. A series of votes set for Thursday, culminating the process, would be Congress' coda to a tumultuous 2015. Despite dissenters in both parties, passage was likely and President Barack Obama's signature seemed assured for an accord bearing victories for everyone from oil companies and working-class families to 9/11 emergency workers and biomedical researchers. \"This is divided government,\" Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., said of the measures, which together totaled over 2,200 pages. In an unspoken reference to a year that saw GOP lawmakers force the departure of former Speaker John Boehner and battle frequently among themselves, Kline added, \"Let's put 2015 behind us and move on to 2016,\" an election year when Republicans hope to showcase initiatives revamping the tax code and Obama's health care overhaul. With temporary financing of federal agencies expiring Wednesday at midnight, congressional leaders planned to approve a stop-gap bill preventing a government shutdown through next Tuesday, giving lawmakers time to finish the long-term spending legislation. The two-part compromise announced Tuesday included a $1.1 trillion measure funding federal agencies in the 2016 federal budget year that started Oct. 1. A separate bill, roughly estimated at around $650 billion over the next decade, renews around 50 business and individual tax breaks that have expired or are about to lapse. Flung between the measures were wins and losses for both parties. As their top triumph, Republicans cited a lifting of the nation's ban on crude oil exports, imposed 40 years ago during chronic oil shortages. GOP lawmakers mocked it as a relic that ignored today's burgeoning U.S. supplies enabled by new drilling methods, while critics called the move an environmentally damaging windfall for big oil companies. In exchange, Democrats won five-year extensions of credits for wind and solar energy producers and a renewal of a land and water conservation fund. They also blocked GOP proposals to thwart Obama administration clean air and water regulations, but many still found the lifting of the oil export ban a bitter pill. \"Not only are we losing the oil, but we're losing the jobs that go into refining it,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. After years of trying, Republicans claimed wins by making permanent business tax breaks for research and development and for buying new equipment. People in states without income taxes could also permanently continue deducting local sales taxes on their federal returns. Democrats got permanent extensions of tax credits for college costs, children and lower-income families. Taxes imposed to help pay for Obama's 2010 health care overhaul, which Republicans have long sought to unravel, were curbed \u2014 to the applause of the GOP and many Democrats. These included a tax on high-cost health insurance whose scheduled 2018 start was delayed two years, a win for unions, and a suspension in 2016 and 2017 of the 2.3 percent levy on many medical devices. Language limiting reimbursements to insurance companies losing money on the federal and state health insurance exchanges was retained, despite Democratic efforts to erase it. Many expired tax breaks were renewed temporarily, including reductions for some companies on Indian reservations, race horses and some film and TV productions. Omitted were two major GOP goals: Language dismantling much of Obama's health care law and blocking federal money for Planned Parenthood, which would be certain to draw vetoes. Eager to enact the tax changes and federal funding without a veto fight that could prompt a government shutdown, Republicans have put those provisions in separate legislation. Democrats said they blocked over 150 GOP-sought provisions. That included one making it much harder for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the U.S., which the House approved after last month's terror attack in Paris. Surviving was widely supported language tightening curbs on foreign tourists visiting without visas. An expired program providing treatment and health monitoring to 9/11 emergency responders was included. Republicans said the bill held the Environmental Protection Agency's budget to 2008 spending levels. They also said they prevented increases in most Internal Revenue Service operations, though that agency's overall $11.2 billion budget was $1.1 billion more than the GOP-run House approved earlier this year. Medical researchers at the government's National Institutes of Health would get $32 billion for 2016, a $2 billion increase. ___= AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and reporters Andrew Taylor and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "CARSON CITY, Nev. \u2013 Nevada congressional candidate Michele Fiore said Monday that her recent comments about shooting people in the head and ending their miserable lives apply to terrorists and not Syrian refugees. The two-term Republican state assemblywoman clarified statements she made Saturday on her Las Vegas-based radio talk show, \"Walk the Talk,\" that some interpreted as conflating refugees and terrorists and indicating she wanted to kill the whole group. \"I was not talking about the refugees,\" she told The Associated Press on Monday, but she added, \"I do not want Syrian refugees in our state, period.\" Fiore, who is known for making controversial statements and posing with guns in a custom calendar and on a family Christmas card, also confirmed that she's entering the race for Nevada's 3rd Congressional District and does not plan to seek re-election to her Las Vegas-area Assembly seat. She previously said she was exploring a congressional bid. Fiore's latest headline-grabbing comments involving guns came when she was asked why she didn't sign onto a letter from the Nevada Assembly Republican Caucus supporting a review of refugee resettlement programs. The lawmaker said she and some of the most conservative Assembly members weren't invited to sign the letter, which was issued after terrorist attacks in Paris, but remained opposed to accepting refugees. \"I'm about to fly to Paris and shoot 'em in the head myself,\" Fiore said on the show, which was broadcast on KDWN. \"I am not OK with Syrian refugees, I am not OK with terrorists. You know, I'm OK with putting them down, blacking them out, just put a piece of brass in their nocular cavity and end their miserable life. I'm good with that.\" Fiore said Monday that she didn't advocate killing refugees, but still wouldn't hesitate to shoot a terrorist if she needed to. She also said she can't trust the refugee vetting process to screen out terrorists, and warned that even women are carrying out attacks, as seen in the San Bernardino shootings.",

(AP Photo/John Locher) (The Associated Press) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listen during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) (The Associated Press) Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, right, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump listen to a question during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) (The Associated Press) ST. LOUIS \u2013 The Latest on the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (all times EDT): 10:50 p.m. Maybe it was the compliments they'd just given each other. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shook hands after the debate ended, something they refused to do 90 minutes earlier. The debate was especially icy at the outset, replete with talk of sexual impropriety and Trump threatening to jail Clinton over her erased emails. But the St. Louis rumble concluded with a voter asking them to say something nice about each other. Clinton's and Trump's families quickly joined them on stage as the debate wrapped up. The candidates greeted their relatives and then circulated the room, which is filled with undecided Missouri voters as well as supporters of the two campaigns. ___ 10:45 p.m. After 90 minutes of disagreeing, sometimes harshly, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are ending their second presidential debate on a positive note. They were asked by a town hall attendee to say something they admire about the other. Clinton says she respects Trump's children, a comment Trump calls \"a very nice compliment.\" He says he sees Clinton as a \"fighter\" even though he disagrees with much of what she's fighting for. He says \"she does fight hard and doesn't give up and I consider that a very good trait.\" ___ 10:40 p.m. Donald Trump says the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama has hurt domestic energy production with overreaching restrictions. Trump says: \"Energy is under siege, under absolute siege. The EPA is killing these energy companies.\" Trump blames Obama, and by association Clinton, for coal mines closing. He first noted West Virginia, a state that typically votes Republican, before adding two key coal states \u2014 Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 he probably needs to capture to win the White House. Trump is also lamenting Chinese companies selling cheaper steel on the international market, hurting the U.S. steel industry. Clinton agrees that China is dumping cheap steel on the market, but notes that \"Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings.\" ___ 10:36 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are laying out their criteria for Supreme Court selections. Clinton said she wants justices who understand how the world \"really works.\" She wants ones who will support the legality of abortion and same-sex marriage. She notes that several of the justices Trump has said he'd consider oppose those rights. Trump says he wants a judge in the tradition of Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia's death this winter opened a vacancy on the court that still has not been filled. The Republican-controlled Senate has refused to consider President Obama's nominee to fill Scalia's seat. ___ 10:34 p.m. Donald Trump is denying encouraging people to check out a sex tape of a former Miss Universe \u2014 something he recently did on Twitter. Referencing the controversy over former beauty queen Alicia Machado, Trump said his past comments, \"It wasn't, 'Check out a sex tape.'\" Instead, Trump claims he just asked people to \"take a look at the past of this of this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\" But Trump did encourage his Twitter followers to \"check out sex tape and past\" of Machado. He also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton helped Machado become a U.S. citizen to vote against Trump. Clinton had criticized Trump for slamming Machado for gaining weight after becoming Miss Universe. ___ 10:32 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton has \"tremendous hate in her heart.\" Trump made the comment in reference to Clinton saying earlier in the campaign that half of Trump's supporters are \"deplorables.\" Clinton apologized for saying that half of his supporters were deplorables, but didn't back down from using that word. After Trump said Sunday that Clinton had \"tremendous hate in her heart,\" she laughed and shook her head. But she did not address the comment the next time she spoke. ___ 10:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton is flipping a question about her comments that half of Donald Trump's supporters fit into a \"basket of deplorables\" into a criticism of Trump's campaign. She says her problem is with Trump, not his supporters. She is accusing Trump of inciting violence and running a campaign based on insults. Clinton says she apologized for her remarks within hours. In a statement, she said she regretted saying \"half\" but did not retract the comments. ___ 10:28 p.m. Hillary Clinton is asserting that \"bullying is up\" among young people because of what she calls \"the Trump effect.\" Clinton says there is \"a lot of fear,\" ''people are feeling uneasy\" and \"a lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\" She is not citing any specific statistics to back up her assertions about a rise in bullying inspired by Trump's bombastic style. The candidates were asked if, as president, they would be devoted to all people in the U.S. Both candidates answered yes. Trump stressed he would be \"a president for all of our people\" \u2014 specifically mentioning African-Americans, Latinos and Hispanics while highlighting what he described as poor conditions in the big cities where many minorities live. He asserted \"education is a disaster\" and \"jobs are essentially non-existent\" in the inner cities. ___ 10:23 p.m. Donald Trump says he disagrees with his running mate Mike Pence on the proper strategy to deal with the civil war and humanitarian crisis in Syria. Debate moderator Martha Raddatz pointed out that Pence had said provocations by Russia in Syria need to be met with \"American strength\" and the U.S. should be prepared to use air strikes in Syria against the regime of President Bashar Assad. But Trump says he disagrees with Pence, a former member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and notes they had not spoken about the issue. Trump says the U.S. focus should be on eliminating the Islamic State, and not getting entangled with fights with Assad and Russia. \"We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved,\" Trump says. ___ 10:22 p.m. Hillary Clinton is pledging not to use American ground forces in Syria, saying it would be a \"very serious mistake.\" Clinton says she doesn't think American troops should be holding territory as an occupying force, saying it's not a \"smart strategy.\" Asked how she would fight the Islamic State in a different way than President Barack Obama, Clinton says she's hopeful that IS will be pushed out of Iraq by the time she's president. But she says she would specifically target IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and consider arming Kurdish fighters in Iraq. ___ 10:20 p.m. Donald Trump is blaming Hillary Clinton for what was called the \"red line\" in Syria, a generalization about the U.S. response to Bashar Assad's regime. But Clinton didn't make the claim. President Barack Obama did. And he did it after Clinton had left the administration as secretary of state. Trump says, \"She's there with the line-in-the-sand.\" Clinton pipes in: \"No, I wasn't. I was gone.\" Trump responds: \"But you were in contact, excuse me. Sadly, perhaps President Obama was still listening to you.\" The exchange was about the city of Aleppo in Syria, where the Assad regime, backed by Russia, is fighting to root out rebels and killing civilians in the process. ___ 10:18 p.m. Donald Trump disagrees with his running mate over Syria. Trump says there's no point in trying to prevent civilian deaths in Aleppo. Syria's most populous city is under intense bombardment by Russian forces. The U.S. government has warned Russia that it's killing civilians rather than terrorists. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, said last week the U.S. should use military force if Russia keeps attacking civilians in Syria. Trump says he disagrees with Pence. Trump says he's no fan of Russia or Syrian President Bashar Assad. But he says the two of them are fighting Islamic State militants, as is Iran. Despite repeated prodding by moderator Martha Raddatz, Trump did not say he'd try to check Russian actions. Hillary Clinton says she'd try to rein in Russia. She contends that Russia is trying to get Trump elected president. ___ 10:15 p.m. Hillary Clinton is listing her accomplishments during three decades as an elected official \u2014 amid a series of interruptions by Donald Trump. When Trump pressed Clinton on why she hadn't changed tax policies that benefit the wealthy, like him, after so many years in office, Clinton said she opposed such policies \"but that's not the point.\" Trump shot back, \"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.\" Clinton blamed President George W. Bush for thwarting her in the area. Clinton then added that, as senator, she helped \"rebuild\" New York after the Sept. 11 attacks, while getting proper health care for first responders sickened during clean up. She says that, as secretary of state, she advocated for global women's rights and reduced nuclear weapons with Russia. ___ 10:12 p.m. Donald Trump is repeatedly interrupting Clinton, while she is largely avoiding barging in as he speaks. The moderators have noticed. As Clinton tried to address why she didn't try to change tax laws when she was a New York senator, Trump tried to butt in. \"Please allow her to respond,\" said CNN's Anderson Cooper said. \"She didn't interrupt you.\" Clinton continued. A few moments later, when the two were addressing foreign policy, Clinton sniped to Trump, \"I didn't want to interrupt you, but at some point we need to do some fact checking here.\" ___ 10:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is promising that no one making less than $250,000 will pay higher taxes under her plan, but those with higher incomes could pay considerably more. Clinton says she wants to impose a special tax on people making over $1 million and a surcharge on those with incomes above $5 million. \"We have to make up for lost times,\" Clinton says, telling the audience she wants to raise taxes on the rich \"because I want to invest in you.\" She says Trump's proposed tax plan would end up raising taxes on millions of middle-class Americans. ___ 10:07 p.m. Donald Trump says he will get rid of the carried interest loophole that allows Wall Street traders to pay a lower tax rate on their earnings. Trump says he would eliminate the loophole that lets money managers count their earnings as capital gains, which carry a lower tax rate, instead of ordinary income. But Trump's carried interest provision doesn't actually raise taxes on hedge fund managers and it creates a new loophole that could provide them with an even lower rate. The Republican says he would cut taxes for the middle class and accuses Clinton of raising taxes on middle-class families. ___ 10:05 p.m. Hillary Clinton occasionally smiles, sometimes jots notes and frequently sits to listen as Donald Trump talks. Trump paces the room, forcefully points at Clinton when addressing her and keeps his lips pursed tight as she speaks. He's only used his chair to rest his hands on the back of it. The town hall-style format of this debate gives television viewers a look at how the presidential candidates carry themselves in stressful situations. There have been no shoulder shimmies. That Clinton move \u2014 prompted in the first debate when Trump said he had a better temperament than her \u2014 spawned a thousand GIFs. ___ 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is saying it's OK to have a public and private position on an issue because Abraham Lincoln did. She is responding to a question about an email released by a WikiLeaks last week in which Clinton said it's acceptable for a president to project differing positions. She was asked whether that's \"two-faced.\" She says Lincoln did whatever he could to get the 13th Amendment passed, allowing emancipation of the slaves, by lawmakers who did not support African-American equality. Clinton says: \"I was making the point it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want them to do. That was a great display of presidential leadership.\" Trump began his response to Clinton's statement by rolling his eyes, and says, \"Now she's blaming the late, great Abraham Lincoln.\" ___ 9:57 p.m. It's hard to name the most memorable line in this combative debate. But the most memorable visual so far? That's easy. It's the image of Hillary Clinton answering a question, while Donald Trump looms behind her. Unrestricted by a podium, Clinton is using the whole stage at the town hall-style forum, crossing in front of Trump to answer audience questions. That's left Trump stuck in the camera shot behind her, standing awkwardly, at times swaying and pacing, while he listens to her answers. Trump often mocked Clinton for spending time preparing for the debate. It's not clear how much time he spent preparing for one of the trickiest elements \u2014 knowing where the camera is at all times. ___ 9:55 p.m. Donald Trump is again insisting he opposed the Iraq War before it started. But despite his repeated claims, the facts are clear: He did not. There is no evidence Trump expressed public opposition to the war before the U.S. invaded. Rather, he offered lukewarm support. The billionaire businessman only began to voice doubts about the conflict well after it began in March 2003. Trump's first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" he said. His first public comments strongly opposing the war came in 2004. Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, voted in favor of the invasion in 2002 while she was a New York senator. It's a vote she has said was a mistake. ___ 9:53 p.m. Donald Trump says a U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004 would still be alive if he had been president at the time. Trump is talking about Captain Humayun Khan, whose Pakistan-born father gave an impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. Trump then got into a feud with Khan's parents. Trump now says Captain Khan is an \"American hero\" and \"he would be alive today if I had been president.\" Trump's feud with the Khan family led to harsh criticism from veterans across the country and families of those killed in action. ___ 9:52 p.m. Donald Trump says the United States is allowing refugees from Syria and the Middle East to pour into America and \"we have no idea who they are\" or where exactly they are coming from. Asked about bans and strict limits on Muslim immigrants into the United States that he's supported in the past, Trump says it was a policy plan that would grow out of \"extreme vetting\" of people coming to the U.S. from global conflict areas. Trump calls allowing immigrants into the country without more scrutiny the \"Greatest Trojan Horse of all time\" and says it has to stop because \"we have enough problems in our country.\" ___ 9:51 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she'll screen Syrian refugees but the country needs to take in more. Clinton says a proposal like Donald Trump's to ban all Muslims from entering the country plays into the hands of terrorists. She also says Trump has alienated the country's Muslim allies. Clinton says \"we will have vetting and it will be as tough as it needs to be.\" But she is evoking the image of a bloodied 4-year-old Syrian boy to argue the United States needs to do its share. ___ 9:50 p.m. Donald Trump isn't answering a question about how to stop Islamophobia in America. Instead, he's saying American Muslims must report other Muslims who are engaging in dangerous behavior. He's repeating the false claim that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters saw bombs all over the floor in the shooters' home but did not report it. Clinton, meanwhile, is condemning \"dark and divisive\" things said about Muslims. She says the United States is not at war with Islam and says Muslims should feel welcome and included in society. ___ 9:45 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are clashing over the future of President Barack Obama's signature health care law. Clinton is vowing to fix the Affordable Care Act and Trump is promising to repeal and replace \"Obamacare.\" Clinton says 20 million more people have health coverage because of the law. She says she wants to \"save what works,\" but the next administration will need to get costs down and provide more help to small businesses. She says if the system is repealed it will be \"turned back\" to the insurance industry. Trump says the system is a \"disaster\" and \"will never work.\" He says it needs to be replaced with a less expensive system that's more flexible for patients regardless of what state they live in. ___ 9:40 p.m. Donald Trump is repeatedly interrupting Hillary Clinton and talking over the debate moderators. He also accuses the two moderators of siding with Clinton and refusing to let him answer questions. The interruptions prompted Clinton to exclaim, \"I know that you're into big diversions tonight.\" Trump seems sensitive to his interactions with Clinton. When the moderators asked a question and it was unclear whose turn it was to answer first, Clinton said, \"Go ahead, Donald.\" Trump replied, \"No, I'm a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead.\" Some in the audience laughed. ___ 9:38 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are clashing over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Clinton says she was \"very sorry\" for using the server, but she takes keeping classified information secret very seriously. She adds there's been no evidence her actions led to classified materials winding up in the wrong hands. Trump is accusing Clinton of lying, and says she improperly destroyed more than 30,000 emails that he says should have been turned over to law enforcement authorities. Trump says he was disappointed that Clinton had not been criminally charged. He tells Clinton, \"Again, you should be ashamed of yourself.\" He is also complaining that the two debate moderators are not sufficiently pressing Clinton on the email issue. ___ 9:35 p.m. Donald Trump is sniffling again. The Republican nominee is noticeably inhaling deeply through his nose in the early part of the debate. Trump's heavy inhalations became a hot topic in the previous debate, 13 days ago in Hempstead, New York. When asked about it the next morning, Trump denied he'd been sniffling. \"No, no sniffles,\" he said on \"Fox & Friends.\" ''No sniffles, no cold.\" ___ 9:33 p.m. Donald Trump is turning Hillary Clinton's demand for an apology back onto her, accusing her of stealing the Democratic nomination. Trump says Clinton unfairly won her party's nod by cheating rival Bernie Sanders. About Sanders, who eventually endorsed Clinton, Trump says, \"I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\" Trump went on to repeat debunked claims that Clinton started rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Trump has fomented the conspiracy for years \u2014 until last month, when he declared Obama, who was born in Hawaii, an American citizen. The long list of accusations was his response to Clinton's claim that Trump owes an apology to the many people and groups he has publicly quarreled with during his presidential campaign. ___ 9:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton is ignoring Donald Trump's statements about her husband's sexual past. Trump referenced Bill Clinton's 1998 impeachment, which followed an affair in the Oval Office and several other scenarios. Hillary Clinton responded by quoting Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention: \"When they go low, we go high.\" Hillary Clinton then said Trump owes the nation an apology for the way he's conducted his campaign. ___ 9:25 p.m. Donald Trump is raising accusations of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton, saying the former president \"was abusive to women\" and saying Hillary Clinton attacked the accusers \"viciously.\" Trump is also noting that Hillary Clinton was a court-appointed defender for a man accused of assaulting a 12-year-old who was raped in Arkansas and says she laughed at some point while discussing it. He also says Bill Clinton paid a monetary settlement to Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state worker who alleged in 1991 that Bill Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. Trump says video where he made crude comments to women \"it's just words, folks.\" He says Hillary Clinton's defense of her husband is \"disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself.\" ___ 9:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the Donald Trump heard on an 11-year-old recording making crude and vulgar remarks about women \"is who Donald Trump is.\" Clinton addressed Trump's predatory comments in the opening minutes of the second presidential debate Sunday. Clinton says the tape shows what Trump \"thinks about women, what he does to women.\" She says that while Trump has claimed the tape doesn't represent who he is, \"It's clear to anyone who heard it, it represents exactly who he is.\" Clinton says Trump has insulted not only women, but African-Americans, immigrants, people with disabilities, prisoners of war and others. ___ 9:15 p.m. Donald Trump denies he was discussing sexual assault in a 2005 recording that reveals him saying he can \"do anything\" with women because he is famous. He says he has never kissed or groped women without consent. And he's continuing to characterize the recording as \"locker room talk.\" Debate moderator Anderson Cooper put it more bluntly, saying, \"That is sexual assault.\" Trump responded: \"No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understand what I said.\" Trump continually tried to pivot to foreign policy, seemingly suggesting his comments pale in comparison to the actions of the Islamic State. ___ 9:12 p.m. Trump did not, at first use, the opening question about setting an example for children to apologize for the vulgar comments he made about women in 2005 that were taped and recently released. Instead he attempted to echo Clinton's remarks. \"I agree with everything that she said,\" Trump said. \"I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country, this is a great land.\" ___ 9:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says at the start of the second presidential debate that the campaign needs to set an example to children that our country great \"because we're good.\" Clinton was asked by a teacher if she thought the campaign was modeling \"appropriate and positive\" behavior. Clinton says the country needs to set big goals and work together to try to achieve them. She made no mention of Trump's vulgar comments in a 2005 tape that emerged Friday. ___ 9:05 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump refused to shake hands as they entered the debate hall in St. Louis. That's a break from traditional debate decorum. The town hall-style event is expected to be tense. Shortly before it began, Trump held a press conference with three women who had accused President Bill Clinton of sexual wrongdoing and Hillary Clinton of acting vindictively toward them. Trump also introduced a woman who as a 12-year-old had accused a man of rape; Hillary Clinton as a young lawyer defended that man. Those four women are seated with the Trump family in the front row of the audience of the debate hall. Bill Clinton shook hands with Trump's wife, Melania Trump, his two sons and daughter Ivanka as they entered the hall before the debate. ___ 8:50 p.m. The fireworks at the second presidential debate exploded even before the candidates took the stage. Donald Trump unexpectedly appeared live on his Facebook page with women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of rape and unwanted advances. They didn't take questions but repeated some of the claims they made against Clinton years ago. The women are expected to attend the debate as guests of Trump. Hillary Clinton's campaign responded by calling it a \"stunt\" that wouldn't alter Clinton's plans to speak directly to voters in the debate. The stunning moment raised further questions about how directly Trump plans to go after Bill Clinton in the debate. ___ 8:45 p.m. The second presidential debate is shaping up as potentially Donald Trump's final opportunity to keep his campaign from collapsing a month before Election Day. With prominent Republicans already abandoning him in droves, other Republicans, including leaders in Congress, are looking to the debate to see whether Trump shows enough contrition to stand by him despite his vulgar comments about women. There's been uncertainty about whether the Republican Party might shift resources away from his campaign in the final weeks or even try to replace him on the ticket. Another layer of unpredictability is the debate format. The candidates are taking questions from undecided voters and will be onstage with stools rather than traditional podiums.",

            "article_content": "Vote Leave supporters walk along a street in central London, Friday, June 24, 2016. Britain entered uncharted waters Friday after the country voted to leave the European Union, according to a projection by all main U.K. broadcasters. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) People (I will politely call them that, when referring to celebrities and media on Twitter) are acting like the Brexit vote is the end of humanity. It\u2019s an online spectacle, this manic hissy fit orchestrated by A, B and C listers who seemingly have ignored the scandalous depravity unfolding in Venezuela, the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the murderous homophobia of ISIS and assorted other Islamist terror outfits, \u00a0the barrel bombing of Syrians (which helped foster the Brexit vote). Yes, the Chicken Littles\u2019 pleading for a re-vote are the same ones who CAUSED the vote, through selective outrage, shallow taunts and cowardly ambivalence. Brexit could have been avoided if its critics could have been honest about the present day world. Brexit could have been avoided if its critics could have been honest about the present day world. But they weren\u2019t. And so, on that note, here\u2019s why Brexit happened, from a Yank\u2019s eye. The Remainders remained home; the silent ones didn\u2019t If you want to know who didn\u2019t go out and vote \u2013 it\u2019s the people hilariously demanding a second chance. The people who were sure Brexit wasn\u2019t going to happen, were so sure it wasn\u2019t going to happen, that they didn\u2019t bother to get off their arses and vote. Now they want a do-over, a redo, calling this election a mulligan. I don\u2019t think it works that way. If you didn\u2019t take it seriously the first time, and everyone else who voted did \u2013 that\u2019s on you. You were caught out in your arrogance and ignorance, assuming everyone who was for the exit was a frail, white angry pensioner. Turns out they were people you know \u2013 they just never told you so! While you ragged on and on about the bigotry of the leavers at a cocktail party in Chelsea or a pub in Islington, those who disagreed just silently nodded, hoping you\u2019d shut up at some point. The Remainders offended anyone who felt discomfort over mass migration. Fact is, Great Britain has been under siege by the Islamophobia-phobia \u2013 the same disease that also grips the American media and body politic. If you express any fears over the rise of Islamism and its assorted toxic doctrines (whose consequences are recently visible in horrific splendor), you are the bad guy \u2013 the racist. You are actually worse than the perpetrator of such misdeeds. The sense that control over your own country was now in the hands of impotent bureaucrats in Brussels, and that a vote to leave could wrest your country away from such toadies who are putting your country at risk \u2013 is not a symptom of racism or xenophobia. It\u2019s actually a sensible outlook given the state of affairs all over the globe. True , the mass migration is not the refugee\u2019s fault: the west shares blame in its ineffectual response. And many don\u2019t wish to flee \u2013 they simply have no choice. But given that over a million who might stream into Germany could then now come to Glasgow or Glastonbury \u2013and within these numbers might sneak a lone ISIS fiend \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t you, a British citizen, be concerned? You\u2019d be an ostrich with your head not just in the sand, but up your own butt. The modern human lacks sense of priority.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s hilarious or sad that Lindsay Lohan, James Corden and others are expressing outrage over Brexit, as Venezuela descends into an abysmal amalgam of Soylent Green and Lord of the Flies. Bold-faced names are expressing elitist outrage over a vote, while people down south are assaulting each other over toilet paper. Venezuela represents real-time suffering, not the hypothetical hysterias put forth over Brexit. The actual policies of \u00a0a government \u2013 one lauded by Sean Penn and Oliver Stone \u2013 are creating a living hell, against the wishes of the suffering people. And yet, the stars in our celebrity skies prefer to wring their soft, precious mitts over Brexit. Here\u2019s why: Venezuela\u2019s demise is caused by an ideology romanticized by the same people fretting over Brexit: socialism. It\u2019s just easier to call a British man who fought in World War II a racist, than it is to condemn an inhuman ideology that he fought and beat. Fact is \u2013 Venezuela would LOVE to have a referendum like Brexit \u2013 to be able to exercise some autonomy over and away from the tyrannical ideologues who\u2019ve destroyed their once rich country. Instead they starve and/or die, while the media denigrates grannies drinking tea. How did this lead to Brexit? I have a theory.\u00a0 Philosophers who are way smarter than me have studied this perplexing priority\u00a0 -- that despite leading moral lives we tend to care more about a small problem in our vicinity (my roof is leaking), than a larger problem far away (a mudslide kills hundreds). Even more, research shows that the larger the suffering, the less we react. Meaning our heartstrings will be pulled harder by the photo of one starving child \u2013 than many children equally in pain. It\u2019s weird but true. We care less when there is more. What we are seeing with Brexit is a play on this weird reflex.\u00a0 Because a starlet once lived in London, this compels her to express an oh-so-brave stance against Brexit (even though a week ago she might have thought Brexit was a laxative). Yet, has she said anything about Venezuela, or Syria, or Afghanistan, or the Taliban?\u00a0 I must have missed it. My point: it\u2019s no longer a comparison between one starving child and many, it\u2019s a choice between exercising one\u2019s moral superiority in a risk-free environment (let\u2019s go on Twitter and call pro-Brexit people racist or dumb) \u2013 and calling out real horror (islamists chucking gays off bridges and buildings). This moral cowardice as expressed by the most well-known of earthlings is what led to Brexit.\u00a0 Brexit wasn\u2019t just evidence of a natural concern over one\u2019s well being in the face of rising Islamism amidst the European Union\u2019s lax immigration policy, it\u2019s also a big middle finger (or two \u201cmiddle\u201d fingers, if you\u2019re British) to those who cannot prioritize injustice, or evil. So call those who voted for Brexit\u00a0 bigots or idiots -- you\u2019ll only encourage them. And by selectively ignoring greater evils around you -- you\u2019ll be making the case for leaving better than the leavers ever could.\u00a0 And you make the world less safe, too. Maybe it\u2019s good you stick to Twitter.",

            "article_content": "FILE - In this July 14, 2016 file photo, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence speaks in Indianapolis. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says on Twitter that he has picked Pence as his running mate. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings, File) (The Associated Press) INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 As a conservative talk-radio host in the 1990s, Mike Pence described himself as \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" Two decades later, Pence is the unflappable conservative governor of Indiana who's being plucked by Republican presidential contender Donald Trump as his running mate. Where Trump is impulsive, Pence is cool-headed. Where Trump makes conservatives suspicious, Pence has credibility. And where Trump struggles to draw evangelical Christians, Pence is well-regarded by them. A favorite quote highlights how Pence might smooth some of the sharp corners of the Trump campaign and its supporters. \"I'm a conservative,\" Pence says. \"But I'm not angry about it.\" The former congressman also is a proven fundraiser with close ties to billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch and their network of wealthy donors, many of whom have been dismissive of Trump. \"One thing you can say about Mike Pence is he's got a very calm, steady demeanor that in some ways is a little Reaganesque,\" said Christine Mathews, a Republican pollster for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. \"He's a counterbalance to Trump in that way.\" Trump announced on Twitter Friday morning that he's selected Pence as his running mate, capping a wild 24 hours of speculation interrupted by the truck attack in Nice, France, that left scores dead. Not so long ago, their relationship was a little awkward. Trump met privately with Pence before Indiana's primaries, seeking his endorsement. Instead, Pence, under pressure from national conservatives, tepidly endorsed Trump's rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, while still lavishing praise on Trump. Trump won that primary. Before the night was over, Cruz had quit the race. For Pence, a former six-term congressman, Trump's selection offers a return to national politics after his embrace as governor of conservative social issues sidelined his own presidential ambitions. Pence describes himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" In 2015 he provoked a national backlash after signing a law that critics said would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay people for religious reasons. Even some Indiana Republicans have questioned his decisions, suggesting Pence has at times seemed more interested in appealing to national conservatives than doing what's best for the state. Pence's support of the state's religious objections law led to a revolt from the business community, which joined gay rights advocates in successfully pushing for changes to the law. Raised in Columbus, Indiana, in an Irish-Catholic family, Pence revered the Kennedys growing up and has said he voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980. He later identified as an evangelical Christian and was inspired to join the Republican Party by former President Ronald Reagan, whose \"happy warrior\" rhetorical style Pence has since tried to emulate. After attending Hanover College, Pence graduated from Indiana University Law School in 1986. He met his wife, Karen, around the same time and twice unsuccessfully ran for Congress before taking a job at Indiana Policy Review, a conservative think-tank. In a 1991 essay titled \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,\" Pence swore off harsh political tactics he used in \"one of the most divisive and negative campaigns in Indiana's modern congressional history\" while calling for \"basic human decency.\" \"That means your First Amendment rights end at the tip of your opponent's nose \u2014 even in the matter of political rhetoric,\" Pence wrote, though he backtracked in the face of a difficult re-election campaign in Indiana. In Congress, Pence sponsored a few bills that became law as amendments in other legislation. But he built a national following among conservatives for his willingness to buck his own party after opposing President George W. Bush's Medicare expansion and the No Child Left Behind education overhaul. During the early years of President Barack Obama's administration, Pence helped lead the opposition to the Democrat's agenda. \"He has a particularly strong talent, a gift if you will, for being able to stick to principle while making his political opponents or those who disagree with him feel like they are being heard and respected,\" said Ryan Streeter, a former Pence aide and George W. Bush staffer who is now a public affairs professor at the University of Texas. Pence's congressional experience is one trait that Trump, who has never held public office, wanted in a running mate. Marc Short, a former Pence aide and top Koch brothers operative, elaborated: \"He's worked with (House Speaker) Paul Ryan. He's worked with the team in House leadership. He's somebody who has deep relationships in the evangelical movement, and he's somebody who has foreign affairs experience.\" Pence's one term as governor has drawn mixed reaction, and he has managed to alienate moderate Republicans over social issues. Groups threatened boycotts over last year's religious objections law and late-night television hosts mocked the policy, leading lawmakers to approve changes. This year Pence clashed with the local Catholic archdiocese by opposing the settlement of Syrian refugees in Indianapolis. Pence was also slammed for the planned 2015 launch of \"JustIN,\" a state-operated news service that was ditched after critics panned it as \"Pravda on the Plains.\" But he has also presided over Indiana's improving economy and plummeting unemployment rate, which Republicans credit to the state's low taxes, limited regulation and pro-business climate. ___ Follow Brian Slodysko on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/BrianSlodysko",

            "article_content": "Mike Tobin reports from Janesville, Wisconsin You could almost imagine them skulking around the shadows of the U.S. Capitol the past few days. They carried stethoscopes. They dressed head-to-toe in stage black and donned domino masks that looked like something borrowed from the Riddler. Lawmakers had a congressional safe to crack. They had to figure out how to fund the government by Friday night to avoid a government shutdown, approve money for the Zika crisis, address the toxic-water catastrophe in Flint, Mich., and simultaneously help flood victims in Louisiana. It\u2019s not clear if the safe in question read Hamilton, SentrySafe or Honeywell. But the vault was fortified with diamond hardplate locks, devices to relock the bolts and anti-pry doors. This wouldn\u2019t be easy. Safecrackers sometimes use a stethoscope or other audio amplification devices to listen for the click of tumblers falling into place as they determine the combination to open a safe. It was all a matter of just figuring out which digit fell where before lawmakers could solve their parliamentary puzzle. As it turns out, aid to Flint was the crucial part to cracking this safe. Once lawmakers unlocked that issue, the tumblers aligned and they settled the host of issues. Late Tuesday night, House Republican and Democratic leaders forged a deal to allow debate on an amendment crafted by Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., to provide $170 million in emergency relief for Flint. Democrats threatened to withhold support for a stopgap spending bill to fund the government unless Republicans addressed Flint. That put House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in a pickle. The speaker risked a government shutdown unless he could engineer enough votes to pass an interim bill to keep the lights burning through mid-December. A chunk of House Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote yea simply because they failed to secure any of the items in the bill important to conservatives. The other option for Ryan was to latch Flint aid to the spending bill. That would court Democrats and avert the shutdown. But Ryan knew he couldn\u2019t go there. Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, deployed that strategy on various occasions. Even conservatives chastised Boehner for bills that garnered a healthy mix of Democrats and Republicans -- but failed to address conservative priorities trumpeted by influential outside groups such as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth. In some respects, cracking a safe and finding a political solution to a legislative problem is a lot like Goldilocks principle. None of the tumblers can be out of alignment at all. The lock won\u2019t open. It\u2019s not too hot. Not too cold. But just right. Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., finally hit their mark. The duo carved an agreement moving the Flint money to a water policy bill, and Democrats would help support the interim spending bill. Congress would fund the government, and Ryan wouldn\u2019t have to face onerous, internal political consequences. \u201cWhat happened is what I was hoping and planning on happening all along,\u201d said Ryan about the resolution. \u201cI thought it was important to get Flint out of the continuing resolution debate and where it belongs in the water resources bill. Flint is a water resources problem that therefore should be addressed in water resources legislation.\u201d Pelosi knew she held the combination to the safe. \u201cThere's no question the fact that they did not have the votes gave us leverage. But we were prepared,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe children of Flint could not be neglected any longer by this Congress.\u201d Contrast this to what Pelosi said the day before when asked about Flint and the stopgap bill. \u201cThey could help themselves a lot by putting Flint in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have problems on this bill unless they have the votes on their side.\u201d Perhaps, this was the only plausible outcome available. Late Wednesday afternoon, the House OK\u2019d the Flint amendment 284-141. On its face, that looks like a big bipartisan vote. It was. 101 Republicans and 183 Democrats voted \u201caye\u201d to attach Kildee\u2019s amendment to the water policy bill. All \u201cnoes\u201d came from Republicans. The GOP often mentions that it likes to secure a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d on issues. With 247 Republican House members, 101 yeas is a far cry from 50.1 percent of that majority. But no matter. Pelosi and Democrats got what they wanted. Speaking generally, conservatives did not. Late Wednesday night, the House approved the interim spending bill funding the government through December 9 and avoiding a shutdown. The vote: 342-85. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for the package from Democrats and Republicans. Republicans supplied 170 yeas. Democrats slightly outpaced their colleagues with 172 ayes. And, the GOP secured a \u201cmajority of the majority.\u201d But Republicans couldn\u2019t have advanced the plan without Democrats -- to say nothing of solving the Flint puzzle. So, some may ask why 11 months into his speakership does Ryan still need assistance from Democrats to approve spending bills? And how is this not different from the conundrum which weighted down his predecessor, John Boehner? Well, the speaker may have changed, but not the membership. \u201cI think people in our caucus understand the reality of the moment that this divided government presents us with,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan also took a swipe at retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Senate Democrats whom the speaker accused of slowing down annual spending bills. \u201cMy hope is that after the election, they'll drop their political shenanigans and we'll get on at doing the serious business of actually appropriating. If we don't, we'll do another\u201d continuing resolution, Ryan said. By their nature, continuing resolutions, or CR\u2019s, fund the government at existing levels if lawmakers fail to craft a broader agreement. This is what drives some Congressional conservatives up a wall. First, they hoped the House would advance individual spending bills this year under Ryan\u2019s stewardship. The House adopted several. But that\u2019s why they relied on a CR now, glomming everything together. Secondly, the House didn\u2019t even manage to approve a budget, the first step in the annual spending process. Conservatives hoped for a lower spending level for the bill. The total spending figure for this bill is $1.067 trillion. Conservatives advocated $1.040 trillion. Many members of the House Freedom Caucus aimed to tuck policy provisions into the legislation. Those \u201criders\u201d included a prohibition for Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics to receive Zika aid. They also wanted to super-vet Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. None of those elements made it into the final package. \u201cEstablishment Republicans have once again partnered with Democrats to ignore our fiscal crisis, rather than join conservatives determined to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d complained Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho. \u201cOur new Republican leadership vowed to complete the regular appropriations process, passing the 12 bills that fulfill the duty of Congress to take good care in spending taxpayer dollars. Today, they punted.\u201d This is why some members of the Freedom Caucus wonder if things are really that different under the Ryan regime versus Boehner\u2019s. Moreover, one House conservative told Fox they should have just let the government shut down last night. \u201cWe won seats in 2014, didn\u2019t we?\u201d asked the Republican who asked to remain anonymous. After the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, Republicans padded their House majority by winning 13 seats in the 2014 midterm elections. That propelled the GOP to its biggest House majority since the late 1920s. Some conservatives simply don\u2019t think going to the mat over a government shutdown is that bad a strategy. After some haggling, Democrats and Republicans managed to pick the combination lock and avoid a shutdown this fall. It\u2019s likely there could be another safe that needs cracking just before Christmas. Perhaps the most-robust safe could arrive at the capitol next March as lawmakers wrestle with raising the debt ceiling. The debt limit battle is always an ambitious enterprise. One wonders how skilled the safecrackers will have to be to crack the code on that challenge next year.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton makes history, becomes first woman to be the presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton took a historic step closer Tuesday to fulfilling her dream of shattering what she once called \u201cthat highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d\u00a0when Democratic delegates at the party's national convention in Philadelphia officially nominated her as their candidate for president \u2013 making the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state the first woman to top a major party presidential ticket. South Dakota\u2019s delegation put her over the top in the tally, but it was ex-primary foe Bernie Sanders who closed out the roll call and made her nomination official after his home state of Vermont cast its votes. \u201cI move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States,\u201d Sanders said, as the crowd erupted in cheers and waved Clinton signs. The nomination was affirmed by acclamation\u00a0moments later; the final delegate tally was 2,842-1,865. The high-profile show of unity on the floor, at a convention marked from the start by discord, followed speculation about what role Sanders might play in formally anointing Clinton the nominee. The night before, the Vermont senator tried to restore order in the hall by urging his supporters \u2013 many of whom booed Monday night at the mere mention of Clinton\u2019s name \u2013 to get behind her campaign. Those supporters loudly cheered and chanted his name as Sanders was put in for nomination Tuesday afternoon. Some antics popped up during the roll call itself. While the Nevada delegation was casting its votes, Sanders supporters held signs behind the speaker's head saying \u201cRigged\u201d and \u201cI was leaked.\u201d Large pro-Sanders banners practically covered the Oklahoma delegation speakers from the view of some media cameras. Some Sanders supporters also walked out at the end, chanting, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d as a couple-hundred protesters chanted \u201cshame\u201d outside the complex. But the rancor in the hall may be subsiding in the wake of the opening day\u2019s street protests and disruptions inside the convention arena. Longtime Clinton ally and civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., touted her qualifications as he delivered one of the nominating speeches on her behalf. \u201cShe is one of the most qualified candidates to ever run for president,\u201d he bellowed. In a moment of poetic justice, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard delivered one of the nominating speeches for Sanders moments earlier, describing his cause as a \u201cmovement fueled by love\u201d that \u201ccan never be stopped or defeated.\u201d Gabbard had resigned in protest from the DNC amid complaints over how Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had treated Sanders; Wasserman Schultz over the weekend was forced to resign following leaked emails that bolstered those claims of anti-Sanders bias. The roll call preceded another stacked night of speeches, headlined by former President Bill Clinton, the latest party elder to attempt to get the base to close ranks behind his wife and direct its energy toward defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November. Sanders made a similar case the night before. \u201cBased on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States,\u201d he told the audience Monday, with many of his supporters visibly crying during his remarks. The frustration among his base had been inflamed in the run-up to the convention, when the leaked Democratic National Committee emails appeared to show top party officials criticizing him and discussing ways to undermine him. While Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign in the wake of the leak, that alone did not quell the unrest. The party is eager to bring all factions together, though, in preparation for the general election battle officially joined Tuesday against Trump, who was formally nominated by the Republicans last week in Cleveland.

Part of Trump\u2019s so called \u201cnew deal\u201d included new tax incentives for inner cities, new micro-loans for African-Americans to start companies and hire workers and plan to reinvest money form suspended refugee programs in inner cities. POLL SHOWS TRUMP GAINING ON CLINTON \u201cI will be your greatest champion,\u201d Trump told a predominantly white Charlotte crowd. \u201cI will never ever take the African American community for granted. Never, ever.\u201d Trump also pledged to take on gang members and remove them from inner cities. He also claimed that the national murder rate was as high as it\u2019s been in 45 years. \u201cSome of our inner cities are more dangerous than the war zones we\u2019re reading about and seeing about every night.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump was in Washington touting his business empire in the ribbon-cutting ceremony for his new hotel. He made the case that all Americans should look to his corporate record for evidence of how well he\u2019d run the country if elected president. \"Under budget and ahead of schedule. So important. We don't hear those words so often, but you will,\" said Trump, linking the hotel redevelopment \u2014 just blocks from the White House \u2014 to his promised performance as president. \"Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.\" As Trump opened his hotel, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was blasting his business practices on the campaign trail in the key battleground state of Florida. She used campaign events in Florida to attack the GOP nominee for having \"stiffed American workers,\" saying he built his empire with Chinese-manufactured steel, overseas products and labor from immigrants in the country illegally. \"Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy,\" she told several thousand supporters in Tampa, Florida. \"He refuses to pay workers and contractors.\" Clinton also told reporters: \"I was struck today that Donald Trump was paying more attention to his business than to the campaign. That's his choice but we're going to keep working really hard to reach as many voters as possible.\" As the Nov. 8 election looms, the newest Fox News Poll shows Clinton leading Trump by just three points. In an effort to play some political defense, Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence was touting the campaign in Utah in hopes to keep votes from choosing Independent Evan McMullin over the two mainstream candidates. Besides Utah, Pence also was stopping in the swing states of Nevada and Colorado before heading Thursday to solidly Republican Nebraska. Trump, who also held a rally in the city of Kinston, continued to insist he knows more than the nation's military leaders, especially when it comes to the fight against Islamic State militants in the city of Mosul. \"You can tell your military expert that I'll sit down and I'll teach him a couple of things,\" he said in an interview with ABC.

            "article_content": "The state threatening to sue a humanitarian group that wants to bring in refugees against the governor's will Texas filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the federal government in an effort to block six Syrian refugees from resettling in Dallas this week. The lawsuit comes after the International Rescue committee, a nonprofit group, said it would place Syrian refugees in Texas over the objections of Gov. Greg Abbott. Texas hopes to delay the arrival of the refugees at least for a week until a federal judge can hear the challenge. The state said in the lawsuit that the IRC and the federal government have left Texas \u201cuninformed about refugees that could well pose a security risk to Texans.\u201d The White House has said states don\u2019t have the authority to block refugees. The IRC, which was also named in the suit has noted that Syrian refugees are the most security-vetted group of people who come into the U.S. The Obama administration has said the vetting process is thorough and can take up to two years. \u201cWe have been working diligently with the (IRC) to find a solution that ensures the safety and security for all Texans, but we have reached an impasse and will not let the courts decide,\u201d Texas Health and Human Services Commission spokesman Bryan Black told the Dallas Morning-News. Abbott is among more than two dozen governors who have vowed since the November Paris terror attacks to keep Syrian refugees from resettling in their states, expressing fears that militants could plan a terror attack and enter the country under the guise of a refugee. Since the attacks, about 200 refugees have settled in the U.S., including in states where governors have resisted, according to the State Department. The IRC was threatened with a lawsuit by Texas last week. The group said Monday it will still help all refugees in accordance with its obligations under federal guidelines. Texas responded Tuesday with a moratorium on resettlements until the state received \u201call information\u201d on Syrians scheduled to arrive in Texas during the next three months. Texas also urged the State Department in a letter to give them more information about the \u201ceffectiveness of the screening procedures.\u201d In a statement issued Wednesday night, the IRC said it \"has worked in coordination with Texas officials for 40 years \u2014 to the benefit of Texas communities and the refugees we serve. Refugees are victims of terror, not terrorists, and the families we help have always been welcomed by the people of Texas. The IRC acts within the spirit and letter of the law, and we are hopeful that this matter is resolved soon.\" The Justice Department said it would review the complaint after formally receiving it. The White House declined to comment. IRC spokeswoman Lucy Carrigan has said that two Syrian families are expected to arrive in Texas in the next 10 days, including the six who are noted in the lawsuit. Texas currently takes in more refugees than any other state, including about 240 Syrian refugees since 2011. The Dallas Morning-News reports this is the first legal action by a state to block Syrian refugees. The Refugee Act of 1980 dictates that refugee resettlement within the United States is managed by the federal government. State refugee coordinators are consulted by the federal government and the nine refugee resettlement agencies that have contracts with the government, but that consultation is largely to ensure refugees are settled in cities with adequate jobs, housing and social services. Federal courts \u2014 including the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 have upheld that immigration and admission of noncitizens to the United States is a federal responsibility and one managed wholly by the federal government.

Since World War II, Congress has overridden dozens of presidential vetoes. This is in part because certain past presidents vetoed far more bills than Obama has. While Obama has only vetoed 12 bills, President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed 635 bills \u2013 the most bills vetoed by any president in history. Congress was able to override nine of them, on issues including interest rates on bank loans. Congress had greater success overriding vetoes in times when the president had a weaker grip on power. President Gerald Ford, who took office after the Watergate scandal that forced predecessor Richard Nixon to resign, vetoed 66 bills and had 12 of those vetoes overridden. Wednesday's veto means Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy are the only two post-war presidents to never have had a piece of legislation overridden by Congress, despite vetoing 51 bills between them. More recently, President Bill Clinton vetoed 37 pieces of legislation, and only two of those were overridden, including a bill that restricted shareholders' ability to sue for securities fraud. His successor, George W. Bush, vetoed 12 bills (the same number as Obama) and had four of those overridden by Congress -- including a Medicare bill stopping payments to doctors from being slashed. The first override of a veto was in 1845 when Congress overrode President John Tyler\u2019s veto of a bill that prohibited the president from authorizing the building of Coast Guard ships without approved appropriations from Congress.",

The ruthless Vladimir Putin, like his predecessor Josef Stalin, may be a useful ally against an even greater evil, but a \u201chighly respected\u201d leader? Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. But Donald Trump\u2019s admiration for and defense of Putin isn\u2019t wacky or ill-informed. It is evidence of how American politics is becoming increasingly European in nature. Trump often sounds like European \u201cfar-right\u201d leaders with his focus restoring nationalistic vigor and the dangers of foreign migrants. But never more so than with his recent Putin praise. That\u2019s a longstanding trait of Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful far right parties. They admire Putin. He helps them disrupt the political order in their home countries. And that helps him gain the upper hand in his effort to make Russia the world\u2019s dominant power. That\u2019s not to say that the admiration isn\u2019t sincere. The European nationalists and Trump admire Putin\u2019s strength, his explicit targeting of Islamism and his championing of traditional values. And it is all made possible by the failure of the European system. And never has it looked so obviously failed as of late. Aside from decades of economic stagnation and bureaucratic paralysis, the European Union is now forcing unwilling citizens to accept the arrival of millions of Syrian refugees. \u201cFar right\u201d can be confusing for Americans. It\u2019s not in the traditional American understanding of the left/liberal-right/conservative political spectrum. The European right tends to be fiscally liberal and in favor of activist government. Its defining issues have been about national sovereignty and immigration, which are issues about which American conservatives care, but formerly, many liberals did too. The idea of the American system in which there is basically a government party and an anti-government party seems just as odd to Europeans as the idea of a big-government right is to most Americans. But this is what happens to failing systems. And the Republican/Democrat duopoly has failed for sure. A secure border and functioning internal immigration controls are popular with voters of both parties. But to satisfy open-borders hardliners and to maintain the issue as a way to drive deeper the wedge between Hispanics and Republicans, Democrats have refused to act. Even to enforce existing laws. Even in the era of metastasizing Islamist militancy. Republicans, meanwhile, know that if they were to help President Obama to pass the tax overhaul he has long sought, it would be a boon to the economy and help kick off a period of economic growth. GOP leaders say they don\u2019t trust Obama enough to make a deal, but the truth is that it\u2019s that their voters who don\u2019t trust them. Any Republican caught negotiating with Obama on anything of substance would face total rebellion. In this fashion, America is evolving something more like a parliamentary system in which policy advances only occur when one party has total control of both governing branches. The problem is made worse here by the fact that those moments are harder to come by in a system of divided government. And when the tumblers all align, as they did in 2008, parties jam and cram through all of the measures their most ardent constituencies demand. The result is gridlock occasional punctuated by ideological veering and lurching and an increasingly frustrated electorate. No segment \u2013 left, right or center \u2013 gets what it wants and people increasingly lose faith in the system and its institutions. And that\u2019s the time when politicians like Trump can find purchase. If the current dysfunction becomes the norm for America, Trump will be just the first of many, increasingly successful candidates of the European mold. GRAHAM OUTNYT: \u201cSenator Lindsey Graham suspended his presidential campaign on Monday, saying that he has concluded \u201cthis is not my time\u201d despite making a difference in the race. The South Carolina Republican made the comments in a YouTube video. \u2018Since launching my campaign for president on June 1, I have offered a path to saving the American dream and working together on bold solutions to solve big problems,\u2019 said Mr. Graham, one of the most hawkish foreign policy voices in the race who has nonetheless been stuck in the low single digits in polls.\u201d 2016 GOP POWER INDEX:\u00a0JEB AGAIN?It\u2019s bad to be without a clear path to the nomination. But, as a political saying goes, it can be \u201cliberating.\u201d Like his stablemate John Kasich, Jeb Bush is devoting himself almost exclusively to hammering away at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Hitting the guy at the top of the polls has always been a good way for back-of-the-pack candidates to get attention. While that\u2019s true this time, there\u2019s the added motivation that Bush and others believe that if Trump is toppled, the race will be wholly remade. The last shall be made first, etc. Bush is succeeding with the former. By talking about Trump, Trump, Trump, Bush has gotten a boost in coverage from a Trumpcentric political press. And, Bush has seemed relieved to finally be able to say that he thinks Trump is \u201ca jerk.\u201d But will this help Bush more or Trump more? Given the fact that so few are willing to tackle Trump head-on and that Power Index frontrunner Ted Cruz is Trump\u2019s ablest enabler, Bush has little choice but to weaponize his candidacy. But at the same time, Bush is one of the least popular figures in his party and has always made the best foil for Trump. In the long run, a Bush resurgence most likely helps Trump. But in the short term, Bush is playing the card he has left. And given the devastating efficiency in which Cruz and Rubio are slashing each other to ribbons right now, every other non-Trump has a bit more reason to hope that the front of the pack might crack open. 1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Donald Trump; 4)\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0[+1]; 5)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[-1]; 6) Chris Christie On the radar -\u00a0Ben Carson,\u00a0John Kasich,\u00a0Rand Paul and\u00a0Mike Huckabee[Watch Fox: Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0joins \u201cThe Real Story with\u00a0Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.] What would you say? -\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

Alfa Romeo had been making racecars for decades\u2026But the 1967 Duetto Spider, a two-seat convertible roadster, was a real beauty: It had a sharp nose and a rounded, tapered rear end, glass-covered headlights, and what designers called a \u2018classic scallop\u2019 running down the side. It handled well, could go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 10 seconds, and got 23 miles per gallon of gas. Though the Duetto Spider was a great car and a pop-culture icon, Americans still weren\u2019t interested in buying it. The model\u2014with new names like the Spider Veloce, the Quadrifoglio and even the Graduate\u2014stayed on the market until 1994, without much sales success.\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Tale of the tape - David Drucker says Dems aren\u2019t scared of Trump and the data backs them up: \u201cIn the latest\u00a0Fox News poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, Clinton was losing to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, 45 percent to 43 percent, and was tied with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, at 45 percent each.

She beat him among voters with college degrees and without; she demolished him with black voters and was only 5 points behind in the battle for whites.

However, it is illegal to offer sex in return for lessons. Transport minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen and Justice minister Ard van der Steur addressed the issue in response to a question tabled in parliament by Gert-Jan Segers of the socially conservative Christian Union party, noting that, although 'undesirable', offering driving lessons with sex as payment is not illegal. In a letter to parliament the ministers said: \u2018It\u2019s not about offering sexual activities for remuneration, but offering a driving lesson. It is important that the initiative lies with the driving instructor, and focuses on offering a driving lesson, with the payment provided in sexual acts. When a sexual act offered in lieu of financial payment, that is prostitution.\u2019\u201d Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 Gov. Jerry Brown has approved legislation to make California the second state in the nation to begin automatically registering eligible voters when they obtain or renew their driver's licenses. AB1461 by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, aims to boost California's voter rolls by registering visitors to the Department of Motor Vehicles and was among dozens of bills that Brown announced Saturday he had signed. It follows Oregon's move earlier this year to adopt the nation's first automatic voter registration law. The legislation backed by Democratic Secretary of State Alex Padilla calls for data collected by the DMV to be provided to the secretary of state's office, which would verify a resident's legal eligibility to vote before registering them. Drivers would have the option to opt out or cancel their voter registration at any time. The legislation was among a package of election and voter bills that Brown signed, including AB 44 by Assemblyman Kevin Mullin, D-South San Francisco, which allows the governor to order a state-funded, manual recount of any statewide ballot measure or elected office in which the margin of victory is extremely small. Padilla praised the signing of the automatic registration bill. \"Citizens should not be required to opt-in to their fundamental right to vote,\" he said in a statement. \"We do not have to opt-in to other rights, such as free speech or due process. The right to vote should be no different.\" Lawmakers approved the so-called motor voter law this summer and have held events around the state encouraging Brown to sign it. They say it could add millions of newly registered voters to California's voter rolls, improving a lackluster registration system that has led to some of the lowest participation rates in the country. Some Republican lawmakers say voters shouldn't be forced to sign up. They warn that automatic registration could lead to voter fraud if people who are not eligible are accidentally registered. Critics have also argued that merely increasing voter registration will not make Californians more engaged in the political process or interested in voting. Brown Saturday also announced other bill signings: \u2014 SB707 bans concealed weapons from California schools and universities. It drew renewed attention after a recent massacre at an Oregon community college. \u2014 SB27 gives California the toughest limits in the nation on the use of antibiotics in livestock. The governor also vetoed nine bills sponsored by fellow Democrats that would have created new tax credits or expanded existing tax credits. Brown said the state's budget is still facing financial uncertainties, and the tax credits would make balancing the state's budget even more difficult.",

But a CBS/NYT poll out today suggests that the outrage and fear that has followed the worst Islamist terror attack in the U.S. since 9/11 is helping Trump. The poll, the first of real repute to show him breaking out of his usual range of about a quarter of the vote, has Trump dominating the GOP with 35 percent. Trump is up 16 points since the organizations\u2019 previous survey in October. While this poll was taken before his call for a Muslim crackdown, Trump had already expressed interest in a suggestion to force Muslim Americans to register with the federal government. Voters pretty well knew where he stood on religious tests. And we have real evidence that Trump\u2019s plan to single out visitors based on religion is doing him good, at least in South Carolina \u2013 the vanguard for the Southern, conservative states that will dominate the early going in the upcoming GOP primary season. A new Fox News poll seems to confirm that in the \u201cfirst in the South\u201d primary, Trump\u2019s Muslim ban plan has helped him. The poll was in the field for four days, two of which came after Trump called for the religious test for entry. Trump did 8 points better after the ban than before it. And you can also compare that with a Winthrop University poll taken before Trump overawed the airwaves. In the older poll, the New York billionaire led the field by 8 points rather than the 20 points by which he leads the Fox News poll. Certainly Newt Gingrich\u2019s harsh words about some of the 3 million or so Muslim Americans four years ago helped him to his South Carolina primary victory, so it\u2019s not so surprising that Trump would be successful in a climate of much greater alarm about domestic terrorism. If these Trump polls are harbingers rather than temporary responses to turmoil, the pressure on candidates approaching the vanishing point is going to hugely intensify. Calls for candidates to drop out and support one of the two viable non-Trump candidates, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, will grow as the GOP accelerates toward what promises to be a catastrophic general election.Power Play: Rep. Jolly defends his call for Trump to self deport - Rep.

Clinton\u2019s stance on accepting Syrian refugees, and her ongoing FBI investigation made over half of respondents less likely to vote for her. In a head-to-head faceoff, Clinton sits at 35 percent to her Republican challenger\u2019s 54 percent, a 19-point deficit compared to a 12-point deficit in the November matchup.

            "article_content": "GOP candidate weighs in on president's press conference, Trump's refugee remarks, rise of ISIS President Barack Obama said Sunday the U.S.-led coalition \u201cwill not relent\u201d in the fight against the Islamic State and was confident the terror group would be defeated, insisting the world would not accept the extremists\u2019 attacks on civilians in Paris and elsewhere as the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Speaking at the end of the ASEAN summit in Malaysia, Obama also pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin to align himself with the U.S.-led coalition, noting that the Islamic State has been accused of bringing down a Russian airliner last month, killing 224 people. \"He needs to go after the people who killed Russia's citizens,\" Obama said of Putin The president was wrapping up a nine-day trip to Turkey and Asia, where he met with Putin on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. Despite Russia ramping up its air campaign in Syria against ISIS, Obama said Moscow has focused its attention on the rebel forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad, a Russian ally. He called on Russia to make a \u201cstrategic adjustment\u201d and drop its support for Assad. Obama said violence in Syria will not be stopped as long as Assad is in office. \"It will not work to keep him in power,\" Obama said. \"We can't stop the fighting.\" Nearly five years of fighting between the Assad government and rebels has created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State to thrive in both Syria and Iraq. The militant group is now setting its sights on targets outside its stronghold, including the attacks in Paris that killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more. French President Francois Hollande is scheduled to meet with Obama at the White House Tuesday to discuss ways to bolster the international fight against ISIS. Hollande will then meet with Putin in Moscow. The discussions about a military coalition to defeat the Islamic State come amid parallel talks about a diplomatic solution to end Syria\u2019s civil war. The violence has killed more than 250,000 people and displaced millions, sparking a refugee crisis in Europe. Foreign ministers from about 20 nations agreed last week to an ambitious yet incomplete plan that sets a Jan. 1 deadline for the start of negotiations between Assad's government and opposition groups. Within six months, the negotiations are to establish a \"credible, inclusive and non-sectarian\" transitional government that would set a schedule for drafting a new constitution and holding a free and fair U.N.-supervised election within 18 months. The Paris attacks have heightened fears of terrorism in the West and also sparked a debate in the U.S. about accepting refugees from Syria. It's unclear whether any of the terrorists in the Paris attacks exploited the refugee system to enter Europe, though Obama has insisted that's not a legitimate security threat in the United States. \"Refugees who end up in the United States are the most vetted, scrutinized, thoroughly investigated individuals that ever arrive on American shores,\" Obama said. Still, the House passed legislation last week that would block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the U.S. Democrats in large numbers abandoned the president, with 47 voting for the legislation. Having secured a veto-proof majority in the House, supporters are now hoping for a repeat in the Senate, while Obama works to shift the conversation to milder visa waiver changes that wouldn't affect Syrian refugees. Obama has focused his ire on Republicans throughout the trip, harshly criticizing GOP lawmakers and presidential candidates for acting contrary to American values. He took a softer tone Sunday, saying he understands Americans' concerns but urging them not to give into fear. He said the Islamic State \"can't beat us on the battlefield so they try to terrorize us into being afraid.\" Speaking dismissively of the Islamic State's global prowess, Obama said, \"They're a bunch of killers with good social media.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On 'Special Report,' Doug McKelway takes an in-depth look at Donald Trump's campaign CEO LOS ANGELES \u2013 An ex-wife of Donald Trump's new campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon, said Bannon made anti-Semitic remarks when the two battled over sending their daughters to private school nearly a decade ago, according to court papers reviewed Friday by The Associated Press. That revelation came a day after reports emerged that domestic violence charges were filed 20 years ago against Bannon following an altercation with his then-wife, Mary Louise Piccard. In a sworn court declaration following their divorce, Piccard said her ex-husband had objected to sending their twin daughters to an elite Los Angeles academy because he \"didn't want the girls going to school with Jews.\" \"He said he doesn't like Jews and that he doesn't like the way they raise their kids to be `whiney brats,\"' Piccard said in a 2007 court filing. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, took the helm of Trump's campaign last week in yet another leadership shake-up.The campaign has been plagued by negative stories about staffers, including charges lodged against his former campaign manager following an altercation with a reporter, and questions about his former campaign chairman's links with Russian interests. Alexandra Preate, a spokeswoman for Bannon, denied Friday night that he made anti-Semitic remarks about the private school. \"He never said that,\" Preate said, adding that Bannon was proud to send his daughters to the school. Trump has previously been criticized for invoking anti-Semitic stereotypes, including tweeting out an anti-Hillary Clinton image that included a Star of David atop a pile of money. He also raised eyebrows when he spoke in front of the Republican Jewish Coalition and declared, \"I'm a negotiator like you folks were negotiators.\" Clinton has tried in recent days to highlight Trump's popularity with white nationalist and supremacist groups. She delivered a speech Thursday that linked him with the \"alt-right\" movement, which is often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" Trump has pushed back, defending himself and his supporters, and labeling Clinton \"a bigot\" for supporting policies he argues have ravaged minority communities. Trump has noted that his daughter, Ivanka, would soon be giving birth to another Jewish child. Ivanka Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism when she married Jared Kushner, a young real estate developer who has become a driving force in his father-in-law's campaign. The court filing was among several documents related to Bannon and Picard's voluminous divorce case, filed in 1997, which was revisited several times as Piccard sought support for tuition and other expenses. The documents reviewed by the AP were part of a request for Bannon to pay $25,000 in legal fees and to cover the $64,000 in tuition it cost to send both girls to The Archer School for Girls for the 2007-08 school year. Bannon's remarks about Jews followed other comments that caught Piccard's attention when they were visiting private schools in 2000. At one school, she said, he asked the director why there were so many Hanukkah books in the library. At another school, he asked Piccard if it bothered her that the school used to be in a temple. \"I said, `No,' and asked why he asked,\" Piccard said. \"He did not respond.\" Piccard said Bannon wanted the girls to attend a Catholic school. In 2007, when the girls were accepted at Archer, he told Piccard he objected because of the number of Jews in attendance. Piccard filed for divorce in January 1997, just over a year after she told police Bannon roughed her up on New Year's Day 1996 following a spat over money, in which she spit on him. A police report obtained by The Associated Press said he grabbed her wrist and \"grabbed at\" her neck. When she tried to call 911, she told police that Bannon grabbed the phone and threw it across the room. An officer who responded reported seeing red marks on her wrist and neck. Bannon was charged in 1996 with misdemeanor witness intimidation, domestic violence with traumatic injury and battery, according to a Santa Monica, Calif., police report. The charges were dropped after his estranged wife didn't show up at trial, according to court records. Piccard said in her declaration that she skipped the trial after Bannon and his lawyer arranged for her to leave town. She said Bannon had told her the lawyer would make her look like the guilty party if she testified and the attorney told her she'd be broke if Bannon went to jail. The Trump campaign declined to comment on the abuse charges. But Preate said police never interviewed Bannon. She added that Bannon has a great relationship with his ex-wife and kids.",

            "article_content": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Nine Republican presidential candidates took the stage Tuesday night for a debate that focused almost exclusively on foreign policy. But the gathering of White House hopefuls in Las Vegas shaped up as a pair of mini-match-ups: One debate unfolded between the 44-year-old senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. And in a surprise rumble, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush went hard after billionaire real estate mogul and GOP front-runner Donald Trump. And Trump, by the way, promised anew he'd stick with the GOP. He says he'll pass on running as a third-party or independent candidate. Here's a look at those moments and some of the other key takeaways from the last GOP presidential debate of the year. ___ CRUZ AND RUBIO RUMBLE The back-and-forth between Cruz and Rubio erupted at several points throughout the evening. First, the duo tangled over the federal government's bulk collection of phone data via a program that began after the 9/11 attacks and was recently ended by Congress. Cruz defended his vote against the program, saying it gave law enforcement too much unchecked power. When Rubio responded by calling the program a necessary tool to protect the country, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul jumped in to retort that he is \"completely wrong.\" Cruz and Rubio also sparred over how best to combat the Islamic State. Cruz reiterated his position that the U.S. needs to use \"overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS.\" Rubio dismissed that plan by saying that doing so \"is not to lead at all.\" Rubio said terrorists cannot be defeated only by air strikes, arguing a ground force primarily made up of Sunni Arabs is also needed to beat back the Islamic militants. The two also tussled over immigration, with each accusing the other of changing his tune on the contentious topic. \"I understand that Marco wants to raise confusion,\" Cruz charged. ___ BUSH GOES AFTER TRUMP As the two-hour-plus debate opened, Bush said Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. is \"not serious\" and would make the country less safe. Then came a punch: \"Donald is great at one-liners, but he's a chaos candidate and he'd be a chaos president.\" The audience \"oohed\" at the jab, and a visibly agitated Trump responded that Bush was only attacking him \"because I'm leading and his campaign has been a total disaster and nobody cares.\" The two candidates later ended up in a tense exchange that wandered far from the foreign policy questions at issue. \"If you think this is tough and you're not being treated fairly, imagine dealing with Putin,\" Bush said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump's reaction was to remind Bush of the wide gulf between them in preference polls. \"You started off here,\" Trump said, gesturing to his place at the center of the stage where the leaders in the polls stand. \"You're moving further and further. Pretty soon you're going to be off the end.\" Bush leveled one more insult at Trump later in the debate, saying the political novice bones up on foreign policy by watching television. \"Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran,\" Bush said. \"And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows. That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security. \" ___ OTHERS PASS ON POKING TRUMP Despite enticements from the CNN moderators, both Rubio and Cruz pointedly declined to go after Trump \u2014 even on his proposed Muslim ban. Both said they understood where he was coming from, but that the policy simply wouldn't work. \"Everyone understands why Donald has suggested what he has,\" Cruz said. He promoted his own legislation as more appropriate and narrowly focused. His bill would suspend for three years welcoming refugees from countries where the Islamic State has a large footprint. Asked about recent statements they've made about each other, Trump and Cruz both played nice. Trump said Cruz has a \"wonderful temperament,\" reaching over to give him a little pat on the back. And Cruz said it's up to voters to decide if Trump is capable to serve. ___ TRUMP PLEDGES LOVE TO THE GOP Trump's debate performance was like that of his first four \u2014 not particularly splashy. However, near the end of the debate, Trump delivered a series of assurances that he's a Republican. \"I'm totally committed to the Republican Party,\" he said. \"I'm honored to be the front-runner.\" That's a drastic change from the first debate, when Trump alone raised his hand to show that he wasn't willing to swear off running as an independent. Even in recent days, Trump has warned that he might do so if he feels the Republican Party isn't showing him enough respect. A third-party or independent run from Trump would be a nightmare for the GOP, providing a huge boost to the Democratic nominee in the general election. ___ CHRISTIE REACHES FOR THE SPOTLIGHT After his relegation to the undercard debate last time out, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sought to make the most of his return trip to the main event stage. Christie frequently addressed the cameras directly \u2014 a different strategy than most of the others. He also repeatedly referenced his time as a federal prosecutor, saying he was the only one who'd dealt with issues related to terrorism. He said New Jersey was constantly under threat of attack in the years after 9/11 and he had to make decisions about \"whether to use actionable intelligence.\" Christie mocked the senators running against him, and the Senate in general, for \"endless debate about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.\" ___ Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz",

But Syria's war, now in its sixth year, is raging beyond Aleppo, claiming dozens of lives every day. (Aleppo Media Center via AP, File) The Syrian civil war has left hundreds of thousands dead, and even more wounded. But doctors in Aleppo were able save one new life on a day that killed 45.

The impact of the explosion broke her right arm and leg, and shrapnel was lodged in her belly \u2014 prompting doctors to fear her unborn child was dead. The video, filmed by Waad al-Kateab in July, shows the distressing moment doctors pulled the lifeless baby out of his mother\u2019s womb.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama speaks about the massacre at a nightclub in Orlando that claimed 50 lives during a news conference at the White House in Washington, Sunday, June 12, 2016. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press Wash DC) The massacre in Orlando by a self-proclaimed Islamist terrorist removes any doubt that the West or its allies have contained the radical jihadi movement. You wouldn\u2019t know it by listening to President Obama. From the Oval Office on Monday, he remained unable to utter the words \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Yet, early Sunday morning the shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS and reportedly yelled \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d before opening fire. He murdered and injured more than 100 innocents in the worst Islamic terror assault on U.S. soil since 9/11. Family and friends are suffering. Their lives will never be the same. The worst aspect is that political leadership could have helped to prevent the attack by addressing the violent Islamist threat by its rightful nature. As was the case in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino or any of the other murders in the name of Allah against the West the during his time in office, the president will not identify \u201cjihad\u201d as even a possible motivation. He instead talks about gun control, identity politics and thought crimes. Americans know that it was terror. They know that it was hate. They also know that is so much more than that. For weeks ISIS has threatened brutal attacks throughout the world during the month of Ramadan. The Investigative Project on Terrorism has tracked the threat streams along with the intelligence community. What were suspect Omar Mateen\u2019s interactions with various groups in the U.S. and internationally? Who were the groups, and what was the nature of those interactions? Law enforcement officials had Mateen on their radar. Why did they stop monitoring him? Could it have had anything to do with the suffocating political correctness \u2013 in which \u201cworkplace violence\u201d and \u201cman-caused disasters\u201d replaced jihadist terror \u2013 over the last few years? The echo chamber of Islamist front organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Muslim American Society and the Muslim Public Affairs Council facilitate the administration\u2019s obfuscation. They rush to condemn the attacks to American audiences, yet they are the worst enablers of the attacks themselves. CAIR, for example, routinely pressures American Muslims to not cooperate with law enforcement. White House records reveals that leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood regularly meet with officials at the highest levels of government to influence stewards of foreign policy into minimizing the threat from Islamic terror organizations. The president may only have seven more months in office, but he needs to provide the country with a new strategy. It cannot continue down the same path of political correctness, and it cannot wait until a new president assumes office to reevaluate. The evidence of the West losing the struggle is overwhelming. Globally, the number of victims has increased to unprecedented levels. Millions of refugees flood Europe from the Middle East and Africa, Islamists behead and inflict genocide against religious minorities and ISIS has created a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, as well as in Libya. Orlando is such a painful illustration that the U.S. is not beyond its reach. American leadership needs to engage in a frank discussion about where we go from here. It needs to identify and implement a policy against jihadist terror that transcends elections, including the upcoming November ballot. It can no longer punt on the issue and hope that nothing bad happens under its watch. Discerning the threat is not difficult. Identifying its true nature seems impossible to current leaders. Developing effective counter strategies is no easy task, but it needs to start today. Americans will not tolerate any more carnage. Obama said in his remarks to the nation today that the attack in Orlando could have occurred in any U.S. community. He needs to finally understand that there is something dreadfully wrong with that.",

Inspired by his Syrian immigrant father, Alacha plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in modern Middle Eastern studies. He goes to Oxford in 2016, where he plans to widen his studies to examine whether Western notions of human rights are compatible with Islamic law. (May Barakat via AP) (The Associated Press) BOSTON \u2013 The honor of winning a Rhodes scholarship carries extra weight for Neil Alacha. It will help connect him to his Middle Eastern roots. A senior at Harvard University, Alacha was among 32 U.S. students announced Saturday as winners of one of academia's most prestigious awards, which will send them to England's University of Oxford. He plans to pursue a master's degree in modern Middle Eastern studies, inspired by his father, a Syrian immigrant. During his childhood, Alacha grew up in the same Brooklyn neighborhood as his mother. He played in the same park she had. Her family's old home was across the street. But his father's early life was largely a mystery to Alacha, a gap he credits with sparking his curiosity about the Middle East. \"I've never been to Syria. I have no idea what the sights and sounds of my dad's childhood were,\" said Alacha, 21. \"I had a lot of questions.\" After graduating at the top of his class from the elite Brooklyn Technical High School, Alacha headed to Harvard and began exploring his heritage. He took Arabic language classes and spent two summers studying in Jordan, one of the few Middle Eastern countries U.S. colleges deem safe for student travel. At Oxford, he plans to examine whether Western notions of human rights are compatible with Islamic law. He's now writing his senior thesis at Harvard on human rights and the Syrian refugee crisis, and he spent last summer talking with Jordanian officials about balancing the interests of local communities with those of refugees. It's a personal topic for Alacha and his family. His father grew up in Damascus, Alacha said, and still has two brothers who live there. His father, Michael Alacha, came to the U.S. in 1978 to get a college degree. He eventually found work as an engineer and became a U.S. citizen. His mother's family comes from a mix of European countries. As a child, Alacha said, he met relatives from both sides who spoke languages he had never heard. \"I saw that we're all driven by the same basic emotions,\" he said. \"There's something that bridges us together past our national divide.\" Those who know Alacha praised his ability to analyze issues from a wide range of standpoints, even if they differ with his own. \"What is particularly good about his creativity is that it's supported by a tremendous intellect,\" said Eric Malczewski, his academic adviser and a lecturer on social studies at Harvard. \"He is a student who not only grasps the ideas, but he makes something new out of them.\" Friends have called Alacha warm and genial. He's a roller-coaster fanatic who, in his spare time, has helped Harvard employees master English as a second language. But he has a competitive streak, too. In eighth grade, Alacha won a New York City spelling bee. Last school year, he led the first Harvard mock trial team to win a national title. He is president of Harvard's model congress, which runs government simulations for high school students around the world. Still, on Saturday, after an interview at a ritzy New York club before a panel of esteemed academics, Alacha was overwhelmed to learn he had won the Rhodes scholarship. He was among 2,000 students across the country who had asked their colleges to nominate them for the coveted award. Afterward, he and his parents celebrated over a nostalgic dinner at Sancho's Restaurant in Brooklyn, one of his longtime favorites. Next year, he leaves for Oxford and a chance to study some of the biggest problems in the Middle East. \"I doubt that in a two-year master's I'll have any sort of answer,\" he said, \"but the most important thing is that I and others are able to understand different perspectives.\"",

And then Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president and former governor of New Mexico, went deer-in-the-headlights and dropped this verbal barrel bomb, \u201cand what is Aleppo?\u201d An awful moment \u2013 perhaps a devastating one -- \u00a0for him as a candidate. The pauses painful and potent. #AndWhatisAleppo?  It\u2019s a very good question. A question that prompts the squirming. It is one we must answer. It is Sarajevo, it is Bosnia, it is a village in Rwanda. It\u2019s a place we thought would go away. It is somebody\u2019s home. And thus a new Twitter hashtag was born. \u00a0We should all be asking ourselves this question: \u00a0#AndWhatisAleppo? Perhaps it\u2019s not so surprising -- not to know. The White House speaks of it only when pressed.\u00a0 No one wants to go there, it\u2019s nearly impossible for reporters and aid workers, although the brave get through and we commend them. Aleppo is the town in war torn Syria where a little boy named Omran was recently swept out of his crumbled home by an aid worker and seated in an emergency vehicle.\u00a0His heartbreakingly dazed and dirty face was splashed all over the newspapers and TV screens that next day. Some asked if it was a picture that could turn the tide of the world\u2019s attention?\u00a0 But as it turns out, it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 It was just another #Bringbackourgirls moment of sad faces and Twitter angst. This week reports say 70 people were injured in #AndWhatisAleppo by chlorine bombs that were dropped from President Assad\u2019s government helicopters. Last week barrel bombs took out an estimated 16 children who were attending a funeral for others killed in this \u201copposition town\u201d as it is referred to by the Assad government. Barrel bombs are improvised devices in round metal containers, containing explosives, shrapnel and sometimes chemicals.\u00a0 They are crude larger IEDs, dropping from the sky, and targeting anything \u00a0unlucky enough to be in the path.\u00a0 Tens of thousands of children have been slaughtered in Syria according to the U.N., so Omran was lucky to survive.\u00a0 Over eight million children have been affected by the conflict. Many have nowhere to go, nowhere to live and if they are five or under like Omran, war is \u00a0all they\u2019ve ever known. Remember \u00a0#AssadMustGo? Back on Sep 6, 2013,\u00a0President Obama said this. \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus.\u201d The line was crossed, and the only calculus that changed was Assad\u2019s.\u00a0 It became clear he could defend his Alawite minority dictatorship and for now, no one was going to stop him. The world stood back as Vladimir Putin helped him crush the \u2018rebels.\u2019 Threatened with death, the refugee crisis began. Millions and millions of people flooded out of Syria.\u00a0Like their beleaguered neighbors in Iraq and Libya many fled to Europe. Now our allies there are overburdened and scared that -- among those who ran -- are people who want to (and do) cause them harm. There is a battle here at home about how many more refugees we should let into our country as well.\u00a0The compassionate argument is that we must help, but it is also appropriate to ask where was the compassion in 2013, when the \u201credline\u201d was crossed?\u00a0 These people wanted to live their lives and raise their families in their hometowns, but they could not. \u00a0In places like #AndWhatisAleppo, those who stayed are under siege. #AndWhatisAleppo? \u00a0It\u2019s a very good question. A question that prompts the squirming. It is one we must answer. It is Sarajevo, it is Bosnia, it is a village in Rwanda. It\u2019s a place we thought would go away. It is somebody\u2019s home. By late Thursday morning, after his interview, Gary Johnson had issued a statement. It said in part: \"\u2026 hit with 'What about Aleppo?' I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked. It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign \u2026 Can I name every city in Syria? No. Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes.\" Johnson also admitted he needs to study more and gain a better understanding.\u00a0 Perhaps he\u2019s not alone.",

Tashfeen Malik, the Pakistani woman who came to the U.S. in 2014 on a K-1, or so-called \u201cfianc\u00e9e visa,\u201d teamed up a year later with her\u00a0husband in last week\u2019s terror attack that left 14 dead at a San Bernardino,\u00a0Calif. Lawmakers at three separate hearings, including at which FBI Director\u00a0James Comey testified, demanded to know how she gained admittance, especially\u00a0given discrepancies in her application. \u201cWas she actually given an interview in the K-1 process, do we know that?\u201d Sen. David Purdue, R-Ga., asked the FBI boss during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing. Comey replied that \u201cthe process requires\u201d an interview, but that he didn\u2019t know if one occurred. An interview and a cursory check of Malik\u2019s application\u00a0might have revealed that she used a phony address and had attended an Islamist\u00a0school in Pakistan which critics say forges an anti-Western view in students. On the same day, Leon Rodriguez, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told lawmakers in the Lower House no interview was required. \u201cWe only interview people in the K1 visa program in cases where there is some issue that needs to be explored as part of the case,\u201d Rodriguez said in response to a question from Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chairs the House subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. \u201cThat could be derogatory information about the individual.\u00a0 It could be factual questions not necessarily derogatory about the application. That is the existing practice as we speak.\u201d Finally, a State Department official told yet another panel\u00a0the screening process that allowed Malik into the U.S., where she paired with\u00a0fellow radicalized jihadist Syed Rizwan Farook to commit a massacre went\u00a0smoothly and by the book. \u201cAll applicable security checks were done for that individual, Ms. Malik,\u201d said Edward Ramotowski, the department\u2019s deputy assistant for visa services told another Senate panel. \u201cThat includes an immigrant visa interview, it includes facial recognition screening, it includes interagency counterterrorism screening, it included a review by the visa security unit of immigration and customs enforcement, which as a detachment in Islamabad in our embassy there and it included the full biometric fingerprint checks and in all cases, the results of those checks were clear.\u00a0 There were no indications of any ill intent by that individual at the time the visa was issued. \u201c When Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., mentioned the phony address, Ramotowski said embassies and consulates have anti-fraud units that can\u00a0investigate further to verify the data on an application form. And a full week ago, State Department spokesman Mark Toner insisted the K-1 immigration visa, issued to men or women seeking to enter the U.S. to marry a citizen, involves \u201cmultiple layers of vetting with multiple agencies putting folks through various systems.\u201d U.S. immigration data from 2013 showed that 26,046 people entered the U.S. on K-1 visas. Nearly a fifth were from the Philippines.",

            "article_content": "This 2007 photo provided by Chase Millsap shows Millsap with the Captain standing next to a suspected truck bomb following a successful raid in Al Anbar, Iraq. (Chase Millsap via AP) After three military combat tours in war-torn Iraq, Chase Millsap returned home to get on with a civilian life. But there was one thing he couldn't do: leave a comrade behind, certainly not one who had saved his life. Especially not the former Iraqi military officer who had worked with the Americans and was now living a precarious existence as a refugee dodging Islamic State militants seeking to kill him. For the past two years, Millsap has been fighting a different kind of battle, one to gain asylum for the brother in arms he simply calls The Captain. \"The Captain is the epitome of my personal commitment to take care of people,\" said Millsap, 33, who served in the Marine Corps and later joined the Army and became a Green Beret. For the time being, The Captain lives in southern Turkey, struggling to obtain refugee status in what he hopes will be the first step toward seeking permanent asylum in the United States. \"If I go back, I'm sure I die,\" the 37-old Muslim and married father of two said recently during an interview over Skype. He agreed to speak, but, fearing for his safety, only wanted to be identified by his former rank. As he spoke, his 3-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son played in the family's living room. Millsap visited his friend last year at his cramped apartment, hoping he might help him expedite his refugee application. After running into one obstacle after another \u2014 The Captain couldn't get an interview at one government office because his papers were in English, not Turkish \u2014 Millsap returned to the United States and formed the nonprofit Ronin Refugee Project with a handful of other military veterans. It's dedicated to helping those who fought alongside Americans find safe harbor here or in other Western countries. After helping The Captain, they hope to turn their attention to others. \"He's one of millions that's stuck in a system that is broken and he's just gonna continue to wait,\" Millsap said. \"And so we decided to step up, me and a few other veterans.\" He will be in Washington on Tuesday to meet with members of Congress and others to discuss just how the U.S. might go about doing that. \"That's really become my mission,\" said the newlywed who obtained his master's degree from the University of Southern California and then went to work this month as a community liaison helping U.S. veterans reintegrate into civilian life. Friendly and outgoing, Mills was a fresh-faced second lieutenant when he arrived in Iraq in 2006 to lead a contingent of U.S. Marines and Iraqi soldiers. The Captain, a lieutenant himself then, was among the latter group. \"When I met The Captain, I was unimpressed at first,\" Millsap said, chuckling now. He was a Marine, after all, he is quick to add, and no decent Marine thinks anyone can do the job better than he can. Never mind that they were in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by danger in a foreign country where they didn't know the culture. His attitude began to change as The Captain patiently explained why he and his troops weren't getting buy-in from the locals or the Iraqi soldiers. It changed dramatically, however, after a sniper tried to take Millsap's head off during a routine patrol. \"He quickly pushed me down and ran towards the gunfire and because of that, saved my life,\" Millsap recalled. The sniper, seeing an angry Iraqi soldier charging at him, chose to run rather than shoot again. \"And that,\" Millsap added with a laugh, \"is when I truly realized that this guy's OK.\" It was a coincidence that the two crossed paths a year later during Millsap's second tour. He was again in charge of a Marine contingent, and The Captain was now his Iraqi counterpart. The bearded soldier stared at him, incredulous that he'd returned to that hell. Millsap left the Marines after that tour to join the Army's Green Berets, rising to the rank of captain himself. The two didn't cross paths but kept in touch by phone and email \u2014 until one day, the communications stopped. The Captain, Millsap would learn a year later, had nearly been killed when an improved explosive device blew up his Jeep. He recovered and soldiered on until the Islamic State group began moving in and the death threats began. When calls to his home began identifying his children by name, he gathered up his family and fled to Turkey. Now, a typical day begins with physical therapy on his right arm, still damaged by the IED. That's followed by tasks like teaching his children the English alphabet, then studying English grammar himself so he can fine-tune his United Nations application for refugee status. The last time he met with a U.N. official, he said, he was told a decision might come within three months. That was four months ago. Now he's heard maybe in a month or two. Or maybe a year. He and Millsap check in by Skype once a week. During a recent call, he praised Ronin Refugee Project for not forgetting him. \"I feel like you are my family. You are my brother. You and the other group of Marines are really gentlemen,\" he said before his voice began to break.",

Even if Trump were to have lost the nomination in a contested convention, Evangelicals had already slipped up by supporting the rise of a primary candidate whose campaign is characterized by overheated ethno-nationalistic aggression, who wants to curb free speech, who did not immediately and decisively distance himself from David Duke\u2019s support for his candidacy, who seems only questionably committed to the pro-Life and religious liberty causes, who regularly demeans those who oppose him, and whose rallies have been punctuated by violence and civil unrest. In spite of these things, a certain sector of the Evangelical world\u2014let\u2019s call them Trumpangelicals\u2014support his candidacy. But what about the rest of us, those of us who are Evangelical but cannot countenance the thought of an Evangelical-supported Trump nomination? How do we recover from having allowed within our ranks the rise of Trumpangelism? How should we evangelicals reposition ourselves in order to regain our witness? The 2016 election cycle offers an almost-irreplaceable opportunity for evangelicals to redefine ourselves and regain our witness. The redefinition and regaining must include at least three planks: First, it offers us the opportunity to do something we should have been doing all along: by criticizing both the Democratic and Republican front runners, we can show that Christian wisdom often defies traditional social and political categories such as Democratic and Republican. This type of Gospel-centered Christianity will diminish our culture\u2019s ability to classify and dismiss the church as the religious special interest wing of any one political party. Second, we now have the opportunity and responsibility to speak with a clear voice on a broader array of policy issues. Instead of applying our moral exhortations to the Clintons alone, we can apply them also to a GOP nominee whose words and actions cause us a great deal of moral concern. Instead of applying Jesus\u2019 command of neighbor love exclusively to the unborn, we can demonstrate our love for other persons\u2014immigrants, refugees, those who are financially destitute\u2014by making and stating our policies in ways that are both convictional and compassionate. Third, we can help provide healing for the unhealthy and even toxic nature of American politics and public life. Over the past decade, our public discourse has become increasingly uncivil. For our part, Evangelicals can show the world what it looks like to speak and act with conviction while at the same time doing so civilly. We can take tough stances on issues while refusing to misrepresent, demean, or demonize those who oppose us. We can treat our political opponents as people with whom we disagree rather than as people who should be demeaned and degraded. If we evangelicals are going to regain our voice in upcoming years, we must reposition ourselves as something other than the religious special interest arm of the Republican Party. I am a registered Republican. I\u2019ve voted Republican in every election. But first and foremost, I am a Christian. My allegiance to Christ and the gospel transcends my allegiance to the Republican Party; if and when the GOP\u2019s platform or politicians are at odds with my Christian convictions, I will leverage my Christianity to criticize the party. Let us remind ourselves that these are things we should have been doing all along. We\u2019ve failed to do so consistently or recognizably, and the rise of Trump\u2019s candidacy offers us remarkable and irreplaceable opportunity. The moment has come to seize it.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee weighs in on his blunt remarks and campaign strategy on 'The O'Reilly Factor' Donald Trump recently canceled a campaign appearance planned for Upstate New York on Thursday, the latest sign he is backing away from his initial intention to contest states that have not been in play for a generation. Reports from the Trump camp suggest the Republican nominee for president will concentrate almost exclusively on Pennsylvania, Ohio, and one or two other states that would deliver an Electoral College victory by the barest of margins in November. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense to focus on just those three states,\" said a political expert. On the surface, it makes some sense. Why waste time in a state like New York, which he is never going to win, when every vote in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida will have outsized influence over the outcome? But there is a danger in writing off most of the country this early in the campaign. \"As much as I would tell you I'd like it, for obvious reasons because it'd be paying attention to my state, I do think that it doesn't make a lot of sense to focus on just those three states,\" said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College. \"There may be a wider path.\" While his GOP primary opponents built traditional campaigns focused on winning endorsements from local leaders and building voter-turnout operations, Trump flew above them, dominating the field with wall-to-wall media coverage everywhere he went. Replicating that strategy would be harder in a general election, where airtime will be more balanced. Still, with the modern national media landscape, Trump can reach any audience he wants -- wherever he speaks. With the modern national media landscape, Trump can reach any audience he wants -- wherever he speaks. So while it makes sense to air campaign ads in vote-rich swing states and make plenty of visits to them, Trump can address the job anxiety concerns of working-class voters in Pennsylvania just as easily while addressing an audience in Milwaukee as he can in Pittsburgh. Voters worried about Syrian refugees and terrorism in Florida will get Trump's message even if he is talking to voters in Maine. One of the few clear advantages Trump enjoys over Hillary Clinton is his willingness to make himself accessible to the media. While Clinton is reluctant to subject herself to questioning from the press, preferring situations she can tightly control, Trump rarely turns down interviews or ducks questions. While that sometimes gets him in trouble, it could allow him to dominate Clinton in local and regional media outlets. That advantage would largely be neutralized if he spends most of his time in two or three states. Democrats have a built-in advantage: The party has won 18 states with 242 Electoral College votes in every election since 1992. That puts Clinton 28 shy of victory. Most experts believe Trump must turn Florida and Ohio, which -- assuming he wins the states that Mitt Romney carried in 2012 -- would put him within 17 votes of the magic number. Several battleground states have trended more Democratic since 1992. But Pennsylvania has , making the Keystone State and its 20 votes an attractive target. Madonna said while it makes little sense for Trump to burn unnecessary resources in California or New York, he should not foreclose alternatives to Pennsylvania, which last voted Republican in a presidential election in 1988. He noted that Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Colorado -- all states where Republicans have been competitive or Trump has polled well -- have more electoral votes combined than the Keystone State. \"I don't know that you need to be a genius to figure this out,\" he said. Candice Nelson, academic director of the Campaign Management Institute at American University in Washington, said Trump's narrower focus may be a concession to finances. Clinton has dramatically out-raised Trump and had more than twice as much money on hand at the end of June than he did, according to campaign finance reports. \"It may be a resource question,\" she said. \"He may have thought expanding the map was a good idea but then realized he doesn't have the finances.\" By all accounts, Trump got a late start in building a first-rate campaign organization at the state level. It is logical to focus those efforts on the handful of make-or-break states. Nelson it would be easy and relatively inexpensive to add additional campaign stops to the itinerary if opinion shifts. \"He could do that later on if it looks like states that are not in play are coming into play,\" she said. Nelson said voters in many states are used to not seeing campaign ads and other activity. But Trump will raise eyebrows if he skips states that are accustomed to highly visible presidential campaigns, she said. \"If a state that saw a lot of activity suddenly didn't, they might wonder why,\" she said.

He's received death threats since the case of him saving former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, (r.), was portrayed in a film. (Michael Wildes, Reuters) An Afghan villager who saved a Navy SEAL and was portrayed in a Hollywood film faces death threats from the Taliban and is having a tough time getting permission to come to the U.S., according to his lawyer. Mohammad Gulab's ordeal began in 2005, when Marcus Luttrell and three fellow Navy SEALs were ambushed by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. A fierce fight left three dead and Luttrell, the only American survivor, with a broken back and several shrapnel wounds. Luttrell credits Gulab with saving his life, as the Afghan brought the wounded soldier into his home and protected him from the Taliban until U.S. reinforcements arrived. \u201cHe is not safe until he\u2019s on U.S. soil.\" The scene was depicted in the 2013 movie \u201cLone Survivor.\u201d Luttrell was also a friend of Chris Kyle, the subject of the new record-smashing\u00a0movie\u00a0American Sniper, and went through sniper training with him. Yet although Gulab\u2019s heroism has been depicted on the big screen, life has reportedly been hard for him since saving Luttrell. He has had to leave his hometown and hide from the Taliban and at one point, he was reportedly attacked and shot in the leg. Now he wants to come to America, where he believes he will be safer, but his lawyer tells FoxNews.com that bureaucracy is making the process difficult and slow. Gulab has said Luttrell offered to help him obtain a green card, but the relationship between the two men appears to have become strained while Gulab was visiting the U.S. last year \u00a0for the premiere of \"Lone Survivor.\" When contacted by FoxNews.com, Lutrell declined to comment on Gulab or his bid for asylum. For now, Gulab's hopes rest with Michael Wildes, a New York-based immigration attorney who has taken the case for free. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is currently reviewing his file to determine whether or not they would put in a request with the United Nations to have him relocated to U.S. based on what he did,\u201d Wildes told FoxNews.com. (Left To Right) Gunner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mate Second Class Danny P. Dietz, 25, from Aurora, Colo, Lt. Michael P. Murphy, from Patchogue, N.Y. and Sonar Technician Second Class Matthew G. Axelson, 29, from Cupertino, Calif., killed by enemy forces during a reconnaissance mission June 28, 2005. DHS officials did not return calls seeking comment. Wildes added that, although he has managed to get Gulab out of Afghanistan and into an undisclosed third country, it is still urgent that Gulab be given asylum in the U.S. \u201cHe is not safe until he\u2019s on U.S. soil,\" Wildes said. \"I am prayerful this will happen soon.\u201d If Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson finds Gulab's bid for asylum worthy, the department would submit the request to the UN. If approved by the world body, Gulab will be allowed to come to the U.S. and seek asylum, said Wildes. \u201cThat\u2019s as simple as it takes\u2026 I wish it would happen as instinctively as Mohammed Gulab gave Marcus Luttrell safety. We should be returning that same sentiment,\u201d he said. Since the story was first reported by CBS News, some have noted that Gulab visited America before, and have questioned why he did not apply for asylum then if his life is in such risk. Gulab visted once in 2010 when Luttrell paid for a round-trip ticket so that he could come visit, and again in 2013 when Universal Studios paid for him to come to the premiere of \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d which features him saving Luttrell. Wildes said that circumstances have gotten much more dangerous for Gulab with the release of the movie. \u201c[The problem] became more acute over time,\u201d Wildes said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is leading a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today on his bill that would override the laws banning late-term abortions and imposing regulations on abortion clinics in an increasing number of states. The bill, which already has the support of nearly two-thirds of Senate Democrats, would eradicate the restrictions in at least a dozen states where abortions have been banned after the start of the sixth month of pregnancy and rules in many more states that regulate the conditions at abortion clinics. The New York Times editorial board is enthused as are others on the left who have seen access to elective abortions restricted in the aftermath of the discovery of a house of horrors at the Philadelphia abortion clinic operated by Dr. Kermit Gosnell. But Blumenthal\u2019s anti-anti-Gosnell bill takes Democrats into some very dangerous political territory.Trickier topic - The Democrats\u2019 gynecological approach worked twice before to save the Senate, thanks in part to some self-destructive Republican candidates \u2013 most notably former Rep. Todd Akin (who still is out there trying and failing to explain his unorthodox understanding of biology). Having so recently been on these crusades, Democrats still have the battle plan handy and are quick to race into the fray. The fundraising emails were out on the Hobby Lobby case even before reporters had finished reading the opinion and the legislation from vulnerable Senate Democrats was out soon thereafter. But fighting state abortion regulations is something very different than just punking Akin or thinking up some new birth-control hashtags. Americans got comfortable talking about \u201cthe pill\u201d a long time ago, but still find it kind of fun and sexy. Abortion, though, is still a raw subject and demands delicate discussion. It\u2019s a topic around which error-prone politicians ought not tread. The majority of Americans favor restrictions on abortion, leaving the Democratic default position on the issue \u2013 unrestricted access to elective abortion \u2013\u00a0 increasingly out of step. It\u2019s great to say you think ladies ought to be able to get the pill, a largely uncontroversial position for 40 years. But how about sharing your view on when life begins? Or whether unborn children feel pain? Where\u2019s your hashtag for those?Shetlands, sheepdogs - So while today\u2019s Blumenthal hearing certainly is part of Democratic efforts to shift the election narrative and to frighten suburban women about Akin-ite boogeymen lurking in every doctor\u2019s office, it\u2019s also evidence of the power of the left wing in the Democratic Party. One would have to imagine this hearing is designed to placate the vocal, well-funded pro-choice crusaders in the Democratic base and not designed to proceed even to a show vote. After all, the most influential pro-choice political group doesn\u2019t even talk about the issue in its ads, instead attacking Republicans on unrelated topics. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a self-professed pro-life Mormon, knows the power of the issue in swing states like his own. Surely he intends to squelch the subject and get back to regular programming as soon as the hearing wraps. If he doesn\u2019t, Democrats from red states will start having to answer whether they would support rolling back restrictions.Right back at you - Republican strategist Lauren Zelt suggests a different way for her party to counter Democratic gender warfare: turn the beat around. From her column in The Hill: \u201cWhat's our answer to the grammatically questionable #notmybossbusiness? It doesn't lie solely in carefully debunking the Democrats' argument. It's a tedious process, and it doesn't make for a good hashtag, sound bite or campaign ad. A better strategy could be to point out the obvious: In 2014, the Democratic Party is the party defining women solely by their reproductive organs. When did it become socially acceptable again to define women that way? When did we travel back to 1955?\u201d [ObamaCare decision as early as today - A decision could come as early as today in the lawsuit that would end ObamaCare\u2019s insurance subsidies in more states who did not set up their own state exchange. If the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rules in favor to the suit, more than half of the country would lose insurance subsidies in President Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Regardless of the decision, it is likely to appealed to the Supreme Court.]BIPARTISAN BILL TO SPEED UP DEPORTATIONS GAINS GROUNDWaPo: \u201cA pair of lawmakers from Texas will introduce bipartisan legislation in Congress on [today] to speed up the deportations of tens of thousands of Central American children who have entered the country illegally across the southern border. Sen. John Cornyn (R) and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D) say their bill aims to amend a 2008 law that currently requires the federal government to provide greater legal protections to young immigrants who attempt to enter the United States from noncontiguous countries. The legislation would rewrite the law to allow Central American minors be treated like those from Mexico and Canada, who can be deported more quickly. Under the plan, unaccompanied minors from any country would be able to have an immigration court hearing within seven days of their processing by Health and Human Services, and an immigration judge would be required to rule within three more days on whether the child would be allowed to stay or be deported. The bill authorizes 40 new immigration judges to help process the cases. The lawmakers are calling their bill the HUMANE Act, an acronym for: Helping Unaccompanied Minors and Alleviating National Emergency.\u201d [What\u2019s the president doing today?

While Republicans in Congress are still trying to piece together their response to Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion request to aid the influx of Central American children at the border, slightly more adults, 66 percent, disapprove of the GOP\u2019s lack of action. But there is hope for the President, a majority of respondents support the nearly $4 billion plan that will provide care for the illegal children while waiting their deportation hearings, speed up the hearing process and increase border security.Asylum approvals skyrocket under Obama - Daily Caller: \u201cThe number of foreigners who successfully filed asylum claims in the United States almost tripled from 2012 to 2013, up to 30,393. That\u2019s 10 times the number from 2008, when President Barack Obama was elected, and it is evidence his immigration officials are approving most of the asylum requests from the growing wave of Central American migrants. If you came illegally to the U.S. seeking asylum in 2013, you had better than a four-in-five chance of successfully filing an asylum claim. That\u2019s up from a three-in-five chance in 2008. The migrants include mothers with children, and youths who have been brought north by their parents who are living illegally in the United States. Roughly 240,000 migrants \u2014 parents, youths and children \u2014 are expected to cross the border by the end of September.

Any reasonable person would have talked to their neighbor in a reasonable fashion instead,\u2019 said Bill Nagle, an association board member. \u2018For being brought up on a farm, he sure has lost his rural, farm values.\u2019\u2019 Pauline Hampton\u2014Braley\u2019s neighbor, a licensed therapist, and a U.S. Air Force veteran\u2014is a registered Democrat. She reportedly used her four chickens to work with children who have mental health and communication problems.\u201dCrossroads pitches in while Ernst on duty\u00a0 - AP: \u201cConservative fundraising group American Crossroads is filling in for Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joni Ernst while she participates in Iowa National Guard training for two weeks. Group spokesman Paul Lindsay told the Associated Press that the group backed by GOP strategist Karl Rove is spending $415,000 on a 30-second television ad that begins airing statewide Tuesday. That's in addition to the $3.1 million in advertising time the group has reserved in Iowa as part of the $20-million blitz it plans in Senate battleground states\u2026.\u201dSO YOU\u2019RE SAYING THERE\u2019S A CHANCE Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report changed the status for the re-election bid of Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., from \u201csafe Democrat\u201d to \u201cDemocrat favored.\u201d \u201cThe change reflects the broad national environment and Minnesota\u2019s generally competitive nature,\u201d Rothenberg wrote Monday. \u201cThe new rating says little about Republican challenger Mike McFadden\u2019s candidacy, other than the fact that the wealthy businessman appears to have considerable personal resources that he can sink into the race if he wishes.\u201dMCDANIEL TO CLAIM 8,300 QUESTIONABLE VOTESWAPT: \u201cChris McDaniel's campaign is expected to make an announcement Wednesday. The campaign officials are expected to reveal evidence in what they have said are 8,300 questionable ballots from the June 24 Republican runoff election McDaniel lost to incumbent U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran by 7,600 votes. McDaniel claims voters cast ballots in both the Democratic primary and the Republican runoff, which is not allowed by state law. True The Vote, a group out of Texas, has filed a federal lawsuit seeking court order to block the destruction or redaction of any voting records.Wants voting records released - AP: \u201cSenate challenger Chris McDaniel is taking his quest to view original voting records to the Mississippi Supreme Court. McDaniel asked Monday for an emergency order forcing Harrison County Circuit Clerk Gayle Parker to let him see original copies of poll books. He's trying to prove people who voted in the June 3 Democratic primary illegally voted in the June 24 Republican runoff won by incumbent U.S. Sen Thad Cochran. \u2026Parker and her employees worked late Friday to redact birthdates out of the original poll books and offer them to McDaniel.\u201dPALIN PAC PASSES ON HOME STATEAP: \u201cSarah Palin's political action committee gave $40,000 to congressional candidates during the last quarter but none from Alaska. Palin, a former Alaska governor, has not weighed in on the Republican race for U.S. Senate in the state. In 2010, she backed tea party favorite Joe Miller in a race won with a write-in campaign by incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Palin's SarahPAC reported bringing in about $460,000 from April through June. She ended the period with about $970,000 on hand. Contributions to candidates included $5,000 to Dave Brat, a donation given the day after he upset then-U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in Virginia.\u201dCASH CALL Arkansas - Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., raised more money in from April to June than incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. Cotton announced that he raised $2.28 million in the second quarter while Pryor raised $1.5 million.Colorado - Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., outraised challenger Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., in the second quarter by $400,000. Udall announced that it raised $3.1 million between April and June Monday. Gardner announced last week that he raised $2.7 million during the same time frame.

During an interview with Cheney and members of his family, Politico\u2019s Mike Allen mentioned Megyn\u2019s \u201ctough questions\u201d saying that she was \u201cno enemy\u201d to suggest that Cheney was having trouble even in presumably friendly precincts. Megyn offered some helpful guidance for her press critics: \u201cMike Allen\u2019s right, I\u2019m not an enemy of Vice President Cheney. I\u2019m not a friend of Vice President Cheney. I\u2019m a journalist who asks questions and he\u2019s a politician who had the guts to come in here and answer them. And let me tell you something else, unlike a lot of politicians and pundits who come in here and answer tough questions, the Cheneys never complained. In fact, they thanked us for the interview and we thank them for being standup people in coming on and giving it.\u201dD.C. STANDS FOR \u2018DOESN\u2019T COUNT\u2019 Justin Gray, the Washington correspondent for Central Florida\u2019s WSTV, thought it was a fairly average day when he arrived to the Orlando airport. He had his bags packed and his District of Columbia-issued driver\u2019s license in hand. But when an Orlando Transportation Safety Administration agent looked at his driver\u2019s license, he insisted to Gray the license was not valid, according to WSTV. Gray said it was his legal, up-to-date identification from the D.C. government, but the agent said he didn\u2019t recognize the license. After a brief back and forth, Gray said he realized that the agent didn\u2019t know what the District of Columbia was. After much discussion, Gray was finally able to go through security. Soon after the discrepancy, a TSA spokesman contacted Gray to confirm the District of Columbia\u2019s license is an acceptable form of ID and that all the TSA agents in Orlando will be shown a copy of the D.C. driver\u2019s license.AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cIf you treat them here as refugees, you\u2019re essentially saying everybody who wants can come in. \u2026 The idea that you\u2019re importing the problem into the U.S. to me is unacceptable because in the end it means we don\u2019t have a border.\u201d \u2013Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

Rick Perry is taking the next step today as he is expected to order 1,000 members of the Texas National Guard to defend the Rio Grande Valley amid an ongoing surge in illegal immigration. The plan, outlined in a memo leaked by a Democratic state legislator who opposes the idea, would put the troops in place over the span of a month with the aim of freeing federal immigrations and border officials to attend to the tens of thousands of migrant minors already in U.S. custody. [Watch Fox: Texas Gov. Rick Perry holds press conference on border security at 3 p.m. ET.]Previewed in Iowa campaign stop - Des Moines Register: \u201cIf the federal government doesn't send more troops and aid to the secure the U.S. border with Mexico, the state of Texas will act unilaterally, Gov. Rick Perry told a small crowd of veterans [in Iowa] Sunday afternoon. \u2026 When pressed later, though, he declined to offer a timeline for when the state would give up on additional federal intervention and act on its own.\u201d [Flashback - Watch Texas Gov. Rick Perry joust with Fox News Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume on sending troops to the border during a recent \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d appearance.]Risks, rewards - For Perry, this represents a risky gambit. The memo says the price tag would be as much as $12 million a month, not an insignificant sum in a state that is having an testy election-year fight over spending. But Perry, having forced President Obama to meet him to discuss the border crisis during a recent fundraising jaunt through Texas, is pretty clearly looking to press his advantage. The slow-motion disaster at the boarder has left Democrats and Republicans alike calling for the president to take more urgent action than complaining about Republican unwillingness to appropriate new money for the care and housing of the juveniles. For Perry, it is also a way to solidify his position as the hawks\u2019 favorite for 2016. As his term in office winds down after 14 years as governor \u2013 the longest of any in the nation \u2013 outbidding Obama for border security will endear him to Republican voters and further erase the marks 2012 rival Mitt Romney left in attacks on Texas\u2019 immigration policies.Squeeze play - For Obama, he finds himself trapped between public opinion that is squarely against his handling of the crisis and a Democratic base that is increasingly unwilling to tolerate the mass deportation of the asylum-seeking Central American youths. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is reaching out to the amnesty absolutists, as the \u201cRun Liz, Run!\u201d movement gets out of the starting blocks. The 2016 Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, is on the record favoring mass deportations, but for how long? With the left wing flapping and Warren ascendant, Clinton might be spurred to rethink her pro-enforcement policy. By not taking action on the border beyond demanding more money from Congress, Obama has let his party drift into some uncomfortable places. [Warned of migrant surge, administration called it a \u2018local problem\u2019 - Fox News: \u201cThe Obama administration ignored a report to the Department of Homeland Security last year which predicted that a large number of unaccompanied children would arrive at America's southern border in the coming months, according to a published report.]RAND FOCUSES ON ISRAELNational Journal: \u201cWhen [Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.] descended onto the Senate floor earlier this month to promote his legislation to end foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority, he stood next to an outsize poster showing the names and faces of three Israeli teenagers who had just been killed. \u2018Killed,\u2019 Paul emphasized, \u2018in cold blood.\u2019 Not long after Paul stopped speaking, his political operation swung into action. His top strategist, Doug Stafford, packaged the speech into an email that landed in the in-boxes of a clutch of influential Jewish and pro-Israel Republicans across the country. The episode\u2014the pro-Israel bill, the impassioned speech, the rapid dissemination\u2014is a small window into the early and aggressive Jewish-outreach campaign of the junior senator from Kentucky with his eye on the White House in 2016. As Paul lays the groundwork for a presidential bid\u2014he's already hired two top Iowa Republicans and one veteran New Hampshire strategist\u2014few constituencies have received more attention than Jewish Republicans and pro-Israel advocates. \u2019\u201d [Watch Fox: Bret Baier interviews Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mustafa Barghouti, General Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative Partytonight on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d at 6 p.m. ET][Washington Times: \u201cBen Carson won the Western Conservative Summit\u2019s annual presidential straw poll Sunday, capping a three-day extravaganza billed as the \u201crally on the right.\u201d Mr. Carson took 22 percent of the vote, followed by Sen.

A magnificent office!\u2019 And he laughed. As I turned, I was this close to him.\u2019 Biden held his hand a few inches from his nose. \u2018I said, \u2018Mr. Prime Minister, I\u2019m looking into your eyes, and I don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u2019 \u2018 \u2018You said that?\u2019 I asked. It sounded like a movie line. \u2018Absolutely, positively,\u2019 Biden said, and continued, \u2018And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, \u2018We understand one another.\u2019 Biden sat back, and said, \u2018This is who this guy is!\u2019\u201dHillary\u2019s heft helpers - Bloomberg: \u201cHillary Clinton has earned at least $12 million in 16 months since leaving the State Department, a windfall at odds with her party\u2019s call to shrink the gap between the rich and the poor. Clinton\u2019s income since her resignation as secretary of state in February 2013 is derived mostly from her latest memoir, speeches and paid appearances at corporate retreats, according to an analysis of data compiled by Bloomberg. At least 12 organizations that previously booked President Bill Clinton -- who has been paid almost $106 million in speaking fees alone since he left the White House -- also hired his wife. Among them: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the National Association of Realtors. \u2026 Her earnings represent a fraction of the Clinton family\u2019s total income and yet were large enough to rank her not only in the top 1 percent of the nation\u2019s earners but in the top one-hundredth of the 1 percent.\u201dBubba claims he hasn\u2019t advised wife on 2016 run - Former President Bill Clinton, in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newsnight, claimed that his wife has not asked him his opinion of her 2016 prospects: \u201cWe were married a very long time when she was always, in effect, deferring to my political career. I told her when she got elected to the Senate from New York that she\u2019d given me 26 years, and so I intended to give her 26 years. Whatever she wanted to do was fine with me. If she wanted to know my opinion, I would tell her, but she had carte blanche to make whatever decisions she wanted, and tell me what I was supposed to do about it.\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...On this the 45 anniversary of man\u2019s first walk on the moon, Discover\u2019s Cory Powell, talks about a pioneering member of that long journey. \u201cOne hundred years ago this week, Robert H. Goddard received a pioneering patent for a liquid-fueled rocket\u2013just like the one that took Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins to the moon. It was the one small step that\u00a0led\u00a0to one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u2026Goddard\u2019s experiments captured the imagination of both like-minded engineers and the general public\u2013both elements that were crucial to the birth of NASA and the intensifying sequence of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs that led to human footsteps on the moon. Not that it was all smooth sailing for Goddard. In a famously nasty 1920 editorial,\u00a0The New York Times ridiculed his ideas about rocketry, declaring that his claim that a rocket could fly in the vacuum of space would \u2018deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr. Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.\u2019 (On July 17, 1969, as Apollo 11 was racing moonward, the\u00a0Times\u00a0published a gently self-mocking correction: \u2018Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere.

League of Women Voters and WECT-TV (Wilmington). That date has not been set.\u201dKINGSTON, PERDUE PUT IN LAST PUSHWXIA: \u201cThe longest runoff election in Georgia history ends on Tuesday, after two months of handshakes, campaign stops and negative ads. The two candidates for the Republican Senate race will be crisscrossing the state on the final day before the polls open. Congressman Jack Kingston plans a statewide fly around with former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, who backed the congressman after she lost in the May primary. Businessman David Perdue has seven stops planned on his Monday fly around\u2026. Turnout will be key. Before early voting ended on Friday, 119,000 people cast their ballot. That\u2019s about 50,000 fewer people than in the primary back in May. Fewer voters, means a lower margin of error. Which is why each campaign has been honing in on its grassroots supporters. \u2026The winner between Kingston and Perdue will be facing off against Michelle Nunn in the general election. Nunn, mind you, just raised $3.5 million in the last three months -- a lot of money to spend on ads.\u201dGowdy backs Kingston \u2013 A congressman from Georgia\u2019s northern neighbor put last-minute support behind state Rep. Jack Kingston in his race to be the GOP Senate nominee in the Peach State. According to Kingston\u2019s camp, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., pointed to Kingston\u2019s record of voting against wasteful spending and Wall Street bailout while his opponent, businessman David Perdue, supported part of Obama\u2019s spending plans.PAPA CRUZ AND DRIVES FOR CARRChattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press: \u201cHe didn\u2019t come right out with an endorsement, but the father of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was clearly on the same page with Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Carr in back-to-back speeches Saturday before hundreds of tea party activists here. Carr, a state representative from Lascassas who\u2019s hoping to knock off Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., in the Aug. 7 primary, denounced Democratic President Barack Obama as a \u2018tyrant.\u2019 In his own speech, Pastor Rafael Cruz, who fled Cuba decades ago, likened Obama to former Cuban Communist dictator Fidel Castro. Cruz's son, Texas\u2019 junior senator, is beloved by many conservatives. And both men praised the writers of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution as divinely inspired. So it went at the \u2018We the People Rally\u2019 sponsored by the Nashville Tea Party that drew activists from across the state\u2026.And, though many Tennessee-based tea party groups are backing Carr, he has struggled to win financial support from several national groups like the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund. But the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund is getting involved in the Tennessee race. Conservative talk radio show host Laura Ingraham, who last week declared she's \u2018all in\u2019 for Carr, is coming here Tuesday to headline a rally for him.\u201dAlexander ignores attacks - Memphis (Tenn.) Commercial Appeal: \u201cState Rep. Joe Carr, the most formidable of Alexander\u2019s six Republican primary challengers, has pummeled him relentlessly, arguing the deal-making senator is out of touch and isn\u2019t conservative enough for Tennessee votes. Alexander\u2019s response to Carr\u2019s attacks has been to basically ignore him. He never mentions Carr by name on the campaign trail or in conversations with reporters. He has refused Carr\u2019s calls for a debate, saying at this point in the campaign \u2013 early voting started Friday \u2013 that putting all seven candidates on a stage and letting them go at each other would not be of much use to voters. Alexander, 74, certainly doesn\u2019t act like a man who\u2019s worried that his days in office might soon be over, as tea party activists like to boast.\u201dBRALEY MISSED 78 PERCENT OF VETS COMMITTEE MEETINGSIowa Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Bruce Braley is getting a taste of his own medicine on absenteeism. Braley\u2019s backers had attacked Republican nominee, state Sen. Joni Ernst, for missing votes in the state legislature. But now it\u2019s Braley\u2019s attendance record that is under scrutiny as Republicans hammer him for missing more than two thirds of the hearings of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee on which he serves. The Cedar Rapids Gazette checked the claim and found that while Braley had a better attendance rate for subcommittee hearings, the charge was fairly rendered. \u201cWith an absentee rate of 78 percent on the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, it\u2019s clear Braley thinks his time is better spent pushing Barack Obama\u2019s job-killing agenda than ensuring that our veterans receive proper care from the VA,\u201d said Iowa Republican Party spokesman Jahan Wilcox in a statement.#2016 - Des Moines Register: \u201cRepublican Joni Ernst has gone silent while on two weeks of active duty, but her campaign has kept up a steady drumbeat in her absence. The U.S. Senate candidate cannot engage in any political activities while she\u2019s on duty at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin until July 26, so her campaign aides have been posting photos of Republicans who say they\u2019re \u2018on duty for Joni\u2019 while she\u2019s away. Among those in photos tweeted by @JoniforIowa are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who did a jam-packed one-day Iowa trip on Thursday, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is Iowa now for two days of fundraising.\u201dDAINES TOUTS WORK FOR VETERANS IN NEW ADSenate hopeful Rep.

That\u2019s an injustice and it should never happen,\u201d Blackard says. \u201cSteve Daines was one of the first people in Washington D.C. to speak out. He took swift action.

So which seats are most likely to flip from blue to red? Arkansas tops our current consensus among Fox News First readers with 13.5% of votes from readers, followed by Louisiana (12%), Montana (11.6%), West Virginia (11%), South Dakota (10.5%) and North Carolina (10.3%). Fox News First reader Nadine Sutham agrees that Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota will be turn-overs for the GOP. But she also points to Iowa and Colorado as two other states that could help the Republicans gain control of the Senate.On the bubble - Just a handful of reader votes away from Pick Six membership is Alaska (9%). The Frontier State contest pits Sen. Mark Begich, a vulnerable Democrat who as a self-proclaimed \u201cthorn in President Obama\u2019s side,\u201d has been running away from the president\u2019s energy policies and ObamaCare, against the Republican challenger \u2013 most likely former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan or Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell \u2013 who emerges from the state\u2019s primary now just one month away. Heavy outside funding has been pouring into the state, most recently a $3.5 million boost to the Begich-backing group Put Alaska First by the Senate Majority PAC, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid\u2019s political action committee. While national polls show Sullivan as the GOP frontrunner, some local polls show his contest with Treadwell tightening. Throw in the wild-card factor of firebrand Joe Miller and there\u2019s plenty of drama in the land of the midnight sun.

His signature roles as Bret Maverick, Jim Rockford and Murphy Jones captured viewers, portraying a humble hero with a witty, gallant and warm personality.

The conclusions: The partial shutdown is bound to last for at least another 10 days and the stakes are growing by the hour as Americans come to believe Obama is serious about not budging. Boehner and House Republicans are unified behind a pressure play: They keep passing bills to provide funding for popular programs and Democrats\u2019 sacred cows, particularly retroactive pay guarantees to government workers. If Obama remains aloof from the process, things are going to get very dicey on Wall Street and Main Street. To wit: Markets were already hitting the skids this morning. [\u201cThe president has taken many steps over the last several years to show his willingness to negotiate. He\u2019s done it with Democrats saying he\u2019s too eager to negotiate!\u201d \u2013 Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d defending President Obama\u2019s refusal to negotiate in the current fiscal impasse.] Boehner\u2019s ballet - Boehner went on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d to explain his position on the debt limit. Boehner didn\u2019t dispute reports that he was adamant about not allowing a debt breach, which would block the government from borrowing the more than $3 billion a day it needs for regular functions and also likely send interest rates through the stratosphere. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s got nothing to bargain with. Boehner could allow a Democrat-led vote for an unconditional debt hike at the 11th hour and lift the limit for just a very short period. If Obama is looking for stability and a lasting bargain, he\u2019ll have to deal. Boehner added \u201cthe votes are not in the House to pass a clean debt limit. And the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us.\u201d And Boehner is right\u2026 so far. Democrats are feeling the squeeze on funding bills that fund vital services or are helpful to their party\u2019s most important political patrons: unionized government workers. [Watch Fox: Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, appears in the 9 a.m. ET hour] October heat - The tacit admission from Boehner and Lew is that this partial shutdown will drag on until there\u2019s a deal on the debt limit. Obama may be strengthening his hand by his refusals to negotiate, but the crisis is deepening as Americans begin to take the president seriously on his claim. And if the president\u2019s really not bluffing this time? Washington\u2019s problems will soon become the world\u2019s problem. HARRY REID: MEDIA CRITIC - \u201cYou and other journalists have a real shortcoming in that you are trying so hard to be fair that you are unfair ... Democrats have had almost nothing to do with the problems here. It\u2019s all Republicans.\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in an interview with Politico to tout his 2016 re-election bid. Reid would be 76 years old seeking a fifth term. SELECTIVE SHUTDOWN - Amber Alert less important than union reps? - Washington Examiner says the national missing-child warning system, Amber Alert, has shut down its web site. This, despite only 17 percent of the government being shut down and the Obama administration\u2019s move to allow union representatives for government workers to return to their posts. The Justice Department cites the shutdown in the online message directing people away from Amber Alert. Breitbart points out letsmove.org, the web site for first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s initiative to combat childhood obesity is still fully functional. Americans jump barricades to enter parks - The Daily Caller looks at how Americans are accessing national parks and monuments despite the partial government shutdown. Some officials are joining in the civil disobedience: \u201cIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker defied the federal edict, and cleared away barriers hindering Americans. The state \u2018has clarified areas where the federal procedures are over-reaching,\u2019 said an email from Cathy Stepp, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.\u201d [Watch Fox: Sen.

Wallace pressed Lew saying, \u201cDo you not know how many people have signed up, which would seem to indicate another major software glitch, or is it that the number is embarrassingly small?\u201d Lew dodged saying, \u201cit\u2019s obviously not my primary area of responsibility.\u201d Watch the full interview here ObamaCare web site \u201csloppy\u201d - WSJ: \u201c\u2026[T]he federal government acknowledged for the first time Sunday it needed to fix design and software problems that have kept customers from applying online for coverage\u2026Information technology experts who examined the healthcare.gov website at the request of The Wall Street Journal said the site appeared to be built on a sloppy software foundation..\u201d ObamaCare costing 66,000 jobs in Illinois - The Illinois Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, has found \u201cSince 2011, Illinois has lost the equivalent of about 66,000 jobs\u2026through reduced work hours \u2013 more than the number of jobs added,\u201d due to ObamaCare. The Washington Free Beacon has the story. KERRY DEFENDS WEEKEND RAID - Fox News - Secretary of State John Kerry defended the capture of an Al Qaeda leader in Libya long wanted in connection with the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa and subsequent activities. Kerry told reporters that Abu Anas al-Libi was a \u201clegal and appropriate target\u201d for the U.S. military and will face trial. The Libyan government called the raid by the U.S. Army's Delta Force a \u201ckidnapping.\u201d National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin is reporting the latest on the manhunt and what\u2019s next for al-Libi. [WSJ: \u201cThe raids are a tacit admission that Mr. Obama has been overselling victory [over al-Qaeda], but we're nonetheless glad to see the U.S. going back on offense.\u201d] BAIER TRACKS: TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN\u2026\u201cTwo stories on the front page of the Wall Street Journal depict the two sides of executive branch decision making: One that can plan and then make things happen with precision, the other that despite time and repeated warnings cannot seem to prepare for reality when the moment hits. First this story about the raids in Somalia and Libya over the weekend by U.S. Special Operations commandos - Navy Seals in Somalia and Delta Force in Libya. They managed to kill and capture two bigwigs in the terrorist line-up. (Maybe Delta Force can hang around Libya and also get the head of Ansar al Sharia who is said to have been behind the Benghazi attack and who has been talking to reporters there ad nauseum). This shows that despite significant risk, with planning, and precision execution, the U.S. is unstoppable. The other story is this one: After three years and billions of dollars, the ObamaCare website is not \u2018structurally designed\u2019 to handle the people who want to sign up \u2013 \u2018Such a hastily constructed website may not have been able to withstand the online demand last week, they said.\u2019 The difference in the two stories couldn\u2019t be starker,\u00a0showing the best of executive branch decision making \u2013 firm, decisive action executed with precision \u2013 and the worst \u2013 stubborn unpreparedness moved forward in order to make a political deadline. \u00a0Here\u2019s to more of the first kind.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.

During a recent vacation to the West Coast, Williams tracked down the now Ruby Hazen to return the photo, saying it \u201csurvived torpedo attacks, aircraft strafing, shore battery firings and 30 consecutive nights of bombing, two wives and a typhoon in the China seas.\u201d He sent her six roses as thanks for \u201csharing his war years\u201d and six yellow roses for her husband \u201cin case [Williams] had caused him any embarrassment.\u201d HEY, I KNOW THAT POLAR BEAR! - Army Specialist Justin May made a surprising return to Kentucky after an 11-month deployment in Afghanistan.

The Washington Post reveals the nightmarish journey for ObamaCare enrollees who find the federal program has failed them, including some of the 22,000 people desperate enough to send their pleas off to Kentucky in hope of help.From WaPo\u2019s Amy Goldstein - \u201cFor now, the appeals are sitting, untouched, inside a government computer. And an unknown number of consumers who are trying to get help through less formal means \u2014 by calling the health-care marketplace directly \u2014 are told that HealthCare.gov\u2019s computer system is not yet allowing federal workers to go into enrollment records and change them, according to individuals inside and outside the government who are familiar with the situation.\u201dTough luck - \u201c\u2026Addie Wilson, 27, who lives in Fairmont, W.Va., and earns $22,000 a year working with at-risk families\u2026 said that she is paying $100 a month more than she should for her insurance and that her deductible is $4,000 too high\u2026. When Wilson logged on to HealthCare.gov in late December, she needed coverage right away. Her old insurance was ending, and she was to have gallbladder surgery in January. But the Web site would not calculate the federal subsidy to which she knew she was entitled. Terrified to go without coverage, Wilson phoned a federal call center and took the advice she was given: Pay the full price now and appeal later. Now she is stuck.\u201d [Minneapolis Star Tribune: \u201cAs of last week\u2026 just 475 Minnesota workers are covered on small business plans purchased through [the state\u2019s ObamaCare Web site] according to the latest figures.

Yet that is precisely what the president\u2019s health care law does. The health care law has been a disaster from the start, devastating both family budgets and the economy as a whole.

Obama spent his pre-Super Bowl interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly scrambling like Peyton Manning. Pressed by O\u2019Reilly on the administration\u2019s handling of Benghazi, the launch of HealthCare.gov and the IRS, the president appeared at times like a quarterback on a broken play, trying to minimize his losses.

The Washington Free Beacon has more on the cash cows that are part of Planet Hillary\u2019s fauna. She\u2019s on the record - In a letter to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton it made clear that she supports the administration\u2019s deal to allow Iran to have a nuclear program in exchange for safeguards that it will not be used to make weapons.

Paul Ryan [R-Wis.] said Sunday, but only if it puts border security before amnesty for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. \u2018This is not a trust-but-verify; this is a verify- then-trust approach,\u2019 said Ryan on ABC. The Wisconsin Republican added that \u2018we don't trust the president to enforce the law,\u2019 necessitating strong commitments from Democrats to border security measures in any immigration reform deal. Ryan specifically mentioned border security and interior security that includes a worker verification system and a visa tracking system.

ABORTIONS ON DECLINE\u201cThe U.S. abortion rate declined to its lowest level since 1973, and the number of abortions fell by 13 percent between 2008 and 2011, according the latest national survey of abortion providers conducted by a prominent research institute. The Guttmacher Institute, which supports legal access to abortion, said in a report being issued Monday that there were about 1.06 million abortions in 2011 \u2014 down from about 1.2 million in 2008. Guttmacher\u2019s figures are of interest on both sides of the abortion debate because they are more up-to-date and in some ways more comprehensive than abortion statistics compiled by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the report, the abortion rate dropped to 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in 2011, well below the peak of 29.3 in 1981 and the lowest since a rate of 16.3 in 1973.\u201d More WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Forbes\u2019 John Tamny looks at lessons from the career of the coach of the newly crowned world champions in Congratulations To Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll, The NFL's Greatest Failure:\u201cAt one time he was very much seen as unsuited to the head coach role; so much so that he was unemployed.

Paul Broun, R-Ga., in an email to supporters Sunday: \u201cBarack Obama would like nothing more than to ban the AR-15 rifle - and that's exactly why I've decided to give away a free AR-15 to one of my fellow 2nd Amendment supporters\u2026 I am running for the US Senate because we need true conservative voices who will not only vote right but will also fight tooth and nail for our values and our rights.\u201d POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN OPPONENT OUTRAISES BEGICHAlaska Dispatch: \u201cU.S. [Republican] Senate candidate Dan Sullivan had $1.1 million in campaign cash on hand at the end of 2013, according to the summary of his year-end report to the Federal Election Commission. He spent about $147,000 in the last quarter of 2013\u2026 The information available so far shows that [Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska] ended the year with the most cash on hand, $2.8 million. Sullivan, however, raised the most money in the final months of the year.\u201d TILLIS TRIES TO STAY ABOVE THE FRAYNorth Carolina\u2019s GOP Senate frontrunner is state House Speaker Thom Tillis, a top recruit with good fundraising and no well-known primary opponents. Tillis looks to have the best shot to tackle embattled incumbent Democrat, Sen. Kay Hagan, but conservative activists are growing skeptical. Tillis needs to get 40 percent of the vote on a six-way race to avoid a runoff election. So far, he has been trying to stay above the fray. The Charlotte News and Observer checks in on that effort: \u201cIt\u2019s a careful balancing act, one that risks alienating tea party activists as he courts a GOP establishment \u2026 The strategy also allows Tillis to avoid the glare of attention, as well as tea party video cameras waiting for a gaffe or embarrassing moment. With targeted appearances and TV ads, he\u2019s been able to define himself on his own terms\u2026 When first elected, Tillis was widely regarded as a political moderate, more interested in pragmatism than political ideology. As speaker, however, he has presided over sweeping changes in state policies from abortion and gun rights to taxes and voting. As a candidate he\u2019s left little room between himself and his rivals on issues, and often taken positions at odds with his establishment supporters.\u201d KENTUCKY RAIN: OUTSIDE CASH POURS INTO RACEUSA Today: \u201cKentuckians for Strong Leadership, a super PAC aiding Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election, raised nearly $1.2 million during the last half of 2013. None of it came from the Republican\u2019s home state of Kentucky. \u2026 The flood of out-of-state money underscores the high stakes of the Kentucky Senate race, which pits McConnell against [The PAC supporting Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes]\u2026 has raised $260,500. The lion\u2019s share of the money -- $200,000 -- came from out-of-state labor groups\u2026\u201d \u201cGROUNDHOG DAY USED TO MEAN SOMETHING IN THIS TOWN. THEY USED TO PULL THE HOG OUT, AND THEY USED TO EAT IT. YOU\u2019RE HYPOCRITES, ALL OF YOU!\u201dThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the 1993 comedy \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d in which Bill Murray plays a Pittsburgh weatherman who has a rodent-based spiritual awakening, to take a bite out of Senate Democrats.\u00a0 From the committee\u2019s Tumblr-style swat at Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska,: \u201cIf it feels like you're living a scene out of Groundhog Day listening to Mark Begich campaign, it's because you pretty much are. Begich, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team, makes a habit out of repeating he is an \u2018independent voice\u2019 for Alaska\u2026 Mark Begich would love for Alaskans to wake up again in 2008 when his repeated false promises wouldn\u2019t have been known yet.\u201d PICK SIX: ALMOST HEAVEN FOR THE GOP?If Republicans are able to gain a total of six Senate seats this fall, the GOP can take control of the upper chamber for the first time in eight years. Which six seats are likely to move from the blue to red column? The current consensus among Fox News First readers, based on your Tweets and emails: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and Alaska. But reader Henry Jernigan takes up our call to consider West Virginia. \u201cPeople keep overlooking WV where Senator [Jay Rockefeller, D-W. Va.] elected to retire rather than face a strong challenge from Representative Shelley Moore Capito [R-W.Va.]\u00a0 With his retirement\u2026[Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid] and Democrat strategists were forced to search long and hard in order to find someone to challenge Representative Capito.\u00a0 Despite having convinced the incumbent Secretary of State [Democrat Natalie Tennant] to carry their banner, Representative Capito remains the strong frontrunner in a state that has not voted Democrat in any presidential election since 1996.\u201d [Ed. Note: Hear, hear! I\u2019d say West Virginia looks like tougher terrain for Democrats than three of the current top six \u2013 North Carolina, Louisiana and Alaska all have incumbent Democrats with cash on hand who can expect help from their national party. Thanks, Henry.] Share your top six picks. Email them \u2013 just your top six, please \u2013 to FOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM or tweet @cstirewalt. ULTIMATE AGENDA DRIVING MACHINE?Daily Caller: \u201cThe Center for American Progress \u2026 used its influence and position as a progressive think tank to promote BMW\u2019s green credentials\u2026. CAP has greatly benefited from its partnership with BMW \u2013 getting donations from the company since 2009.\u201d TAXPAYERS COVER DUES FOR UNION LEADERSWashington Examiner: \u201c\u2026based on the available disclosures, [the magazine] identified more than 700 federal employees who spent at least half of their time working for unions rather than performing their government jobs in 2012. That figure includes 558 who spent more than 1,500 hours annually on official time, which means they did little, if any, work for their agencies, and 150 who spent at least 1,000 hours annually on union release. Another 232 federal employees spent at least 500 hours \u2014 about a fourth of the year \u2014 doing union duties instead of government work.\u201d FILE IT UNDER \u2018CONSTITUENT SERVICES\u2019LAT: \u201cTwo days after a jury found him guilty on eight felony counts of voter fraud and perjury, state Sen. Roderick Wright [D-Inglewood] introduced a bill that would allow some nonviolent felony convictions to be converted to misdemeanors\u2026 A spokeswoman for Wright said the bill, SB 929, was not intended to benefit him.\u201d IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE INDIGESTION AFTER THE SUPER BOWL\u2026Des Moines Register: \u201cMolly Schuyler shaved more than two minutes off her world record time of finishing the\u2026 five-pound sandwich in four minutes, 50 seconds at the Jethro\u2019s Pork Chop Grill in Johnston. [The 33-year-old waitress and mother of four from Bellevue, Neb.]set a record Friday in Philadelphia by consuming 363 wings in 30 minutes. [Schuyler] traveled to Iowa Saturday to compete in a Pancake Bowl at IHOP in Urbandale, eating 59 pancakes in twenty minutes. She then defended her championship at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival, winning the bacon eating contest for a second year in a row.\u201d WHAT BECAME OF THE SELFIES OF YORE?Had a snootful of popular culture\u2019s hotsy-totsy twitterpation over technology-driven new words like \u201cselfie\u201d or the verbification of \u201cfriend?\u201d The \u201cOxford English Dictionary\u201d makes headlines each year when editors announce which bits of slang will be memorialized in the big book, eliciting lots of Twitter titters and semi-ironic gusts of generational pride. But how about the slang that time left behind? Flovorwire knows. But you\u2019d have to be blotto in a blind tiger not to see that the old words are tickety-boo and that the new, antiseptic neologisms look like foozles.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Dems slipping away from Reid on budget deal \u2022 ObamaCare navigators not trained, committing fraud \u2022 Vast majority believes ObamaCare will harm them \u2022 Fournier: The devolution of Obama \u2022 Sheriff Joe tries stop and frisk DEMS SLIPPING AWAY FROM REID ON BUDGET DEAL - Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his team will need at least eight Republicans to pass a two-year budget deal approved last week by the Republican controlled House. That\u2019s his way of saying that three members of the Democratic conference have already told him that they will not vote for the deal. Which three? Vulnerable Democrats Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina have been noncommittal, but Fox News First suspects that the trouble is on the left. No word as yet from Elizabeth Warren, the freshman Democrat who has taken the reins of the liberal wing of Reid\u2019s conference. Every vote Reid loses means another he will have to get from Republicans. John Boehner delivered. Can Reid? [Drucker\u2019s got the deets - Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker looks at how the deal came together.] Is eight not enough? - Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine all said they would vote for the bill and another four \u2013 Bob Corker of Tennessee, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska were undecided, but sounded like they were leaning toward voting \u201cyea.\u201d Moderates like Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seem unlikely to filibuster the budget deal, so what is Team Reid hinting at? Do they need more? Lawmakers return to town today to start jawboning the deal in person. Fight! Fight! Fight! - How did Team Boehner sell the small-beer budget deal? The promise of fights still to come. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., says the Feb. 7 debt-limit battle will be consequential. \u201cWe don\u2019t want \u2018nothing\u2019 out of the debt limit. We\u2019re going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt limit fight,\u201d Ryan told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace. Fox News has more. [\u201cFor those of us who believe the federal government is too big, too intrusive, too involved in our lives, what [the budget deal] tells us is that if we want a budget deal we can wrap our arms around, we're going to have to win in the 2014 election\u2026Things are much different a year from now if Republicans are in charge of the Senate.\u201d \u2013 Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d] OBAMACARE NAVIGATORS NOT TRAINED, COMMITTING FRAUD - A House Government and Oversight Committee report, first obtained by Breitbart has found, \u201cObamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.\u201d VAST MAJORITY BELIEVE OBAMACARE WILL HARM THEM - Most Americans feel that ObamaCare will make their own care worse. The latest AP/GfK poll finds nearly four in five respondents see their policies changing for the worse under ObamaCare. Another 69 percent expect their premiums to go up, with another 59 percent bracing for a rise in deductibles. About sixty percent of respondents not approving of the way President Obama is handling healthcare. Generation gap - The latest from the USAToday/Pew poll shows Millennials still souring on President Obama and his signature law. Fifty-four percent of young people disapproved of his signature entitlement program. Obama\u2019s job approval with adults under 30 clocked in at 46 percent, down from 67 percent a year ago. Fox News has more. Looked good on paper - Daily Caller reports well over 50,000 paper applications for ObamaCare have yet to be processed. The government has taken on an outside contractor to assist in the backlog. Nearly 100,000 paper applications have been processed with consumers just recently finding out the results. Officials have now resorted to calling these individuals, encouraging them to sign up online. The paper applications do not actually enroll individuals in ObamaCare but merely determines their eligibility. [The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conceded over the weekend that 15,000 ObamaCare transactions were either not recorded or had errors. A spokesperson attributed the problem to \u201clarger technical system issues.\u201d The total number of corrupted transactions is not known. The issues could result in thousands believing they have coverage facing a gap on Jan. 1.] BRITS FURIOUS OVER BOTCHED CARE - A series of damning reports about the quality and availability of care under Britain\u2019s National Health Service have brought that nation\u2019s government-run health system to political center stage. As the Daily Mail reports, the topic is usually off limits to politicians owing to the sacrosanct status of universal care. But as the body count rises from hospital botches and patients grow frustrated with the inability to get doctors, politicians are gingerly picking up the topic. Among the stunning revelations: Nearly a quarter of expectant mothers were abandoned by their midwives. Another study found deadly, egregious mistakes made on a regular basis in the nation\u2019s hospitals. A survey also shows that families have mostly given up on securing appointments with their doctors. Public confidence in the system has plunged to record lows as the government is seeking to address the issue. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said that NHS staff often confided in him about poor care. FOURNIER: THE DEVOLUTION OF OBAMA - Ron Fournier considers a recent WaPo report about the administration delaying controversial rules ahead of the 2012 election for National Journal. Fournier offers this scathing criticism, \u201cThe Obama White House put politics before governing in 2012, lied about it, and still won't own up to it...Obama's apologists will say that every president plays politics with policy in elections years. Two problems with that. First, Obama promised to be better than the status quo. Second, he's worse.\u201d MCCAIN IN THE UKRAINE - Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., join the tug-of-war over the Ukraine this weekend. The senators traveled to Kiev to rally with hundreds of thousands of protesters against President Viktor Yanukovich. \u201cThese people love the United States of America, they love freedom, and I don\u2019t think you could view this as anything but our traditional support for people who want free and democratic society,\u201d McCain said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. Protesters have been rallying since November after Yanukovich refused to sign a European Union agreement, opting for closer ties with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia instead. WaPo has the story. \u2018We\u2019re not mad, we just want to talk\u2026\u2019 - The head of the National Security Administration task force investigating leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden, says he would be open to brokering a deal with Snowden. Rick Ledgett told CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he would consider a deal with Snowden over the remaining\u00a0documents he hasn\u2019t leaked. Russia has granted asylum to Snowden.\u00a0 Snowden has said he would return to the U.S. if he is granted amnesty. BAIER TRACKS: SCROOGES? - \u201cIs the Federal Reserve dialing back for Christmas?\u00a0 The WSJ polled (sorry, paywalled) the members of the central bank\u2019s board and found growing readiness to \u2018taper.\u2019 This could be the first sign that the Fed will really start to dial back its purchase of Treasury bonds flooding money into the US economy \u2013 about $85 billion a month. The stock market seemed to be ok with an improving economy, which was new last week with jobs numbers. So we'll see.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier. WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote that \u201cHappiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.\u201d But what are we supposed to do while waiting for the monarchs of joy to touch down? Arthur Brooks tells us: Get busy and make something. The head of the American Enterprise Institute shares A Formula for Happiness: \u201cSocial scientists have caught the butterfly. After 40 years of research, they attribute happiness to three major sources: genes, events and values\u2026 relieving poverty brings big happiness, but income, per se, does not. Even after accounting for government transfers that support personal finances, unemployment proves catastrophic for happiness\u2026 Work can bring happiness by marrying our passions to our skills, empowering us to create value in our lives and in the lives of others.\u201d [Yeah, yeah, I know it was in Sunday\u2019s paper.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is facing backlash from some conservatives over his budget deal, he is not drawing the ire of Iowans. A Des Moines Register poll shows the 2012 vice presidential nominee with the highest approval rating of potential 2016 contenders.

Rick Perry, R-Texas,\u00a0 holding 55 percent, and Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., garnering 51 percent approval. Only 10 percent disapproved of Ryan, with nearly 30 percent voicing disapproval of Christie. Clinton cruising -\u00a0 The same survey showed 89 percent of those polled hold a favorable view of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with only 7 percent disapproving. Vice President Joe Biden holds 71 percent popularity with Iowa voters. Similarly, nearly 70 percent were unfamiliar with former Gov. Brian Schweitzer, D-Mont., and Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, D-Md. OBAMA FUNDRAISERS BOON FOR DEMS - The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will release figures today touting its best off-year November fundraising ever. The group raised $5.1 million, with $48.6 million raised this year and $12 million in the bank. President Obama\u2019s flurry of\u00a0November fundraisers contributed to the uptick in support as 2014 shapes up to be an expensive race. Washington Examiner has more. KING HAWKISH ON TEA PARTY ATTACKS - Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., is New Hampshire today to help local Republicans with their fundraising. He will also be testing the waters for his own 2016 bid. King has made nearly a half-dozen appearances in the first-in-the-nation primary state already this year. The Manchester Union Leader reports King will use the visit to launch a political action committee called, \u201cAmerican Leadership Now\u201d that counters what he considers the Tea Party\u2019s isolationist views. Wait, isn\u2019t he German? - House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan downplayed Speaker John Boehner\u2019s harsh criticism of outside groups saying the Speaker \u201cjust got his Irish up\u201d and that the Tea Party is \u201cindispensable, invaluable in helping keep the taxpayer in the game, keeping Washington accountable.\u201d Fox News has more.

That was the consensus among viewer voters across the political spectrum during Friday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d All-Star Panel. As measured by Bing Pulse, agreement between Democrats, Republicans, and independents rose sharply when Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., stated some could see deductibles as high as $12,000 under ObamaCare. Democrats agreed with Charles Krauthammer\u2019s conclusion that the administration\u2019s \u201cPlan B\u201d is \u201cessentially nationalizing healthcare.\u201d Discussion of who is actually covered under ObamaCare drew increased viewer participation. Democrats disagreed that the Jan. 1 deadline for new policies to start under ObamaCare may not be met. Krauthammer saw a surge in viewer votes when he asked, \u201cDo you want to live in a country where the federal government controls all of the medicine and health care?

But how about this: Only 37 percent of voters under 30 approve of the job the president is doing. That\u2019s a 17-point decline in one year among the voters who represent what was once the core of the president\u2019s coalition. These are the people to whom the president is making an increasingly frantic plea to enroll in ObamaCare. And surely the \u201cLie of the Year\u201d about Americans being able to keep their coverage and care under his law is a big reason. Sixty-one percent of all respondents believed he knew at the time that his statements were untrue. [When it comes to his signature entitlement program, 54 percent of respondents say they wish it had never passed. Another 60 percent do not see ObamaCare being successful. Sixty-seven percent favor a delay in its implementation, including 54 percent of Democrats.] Can you hear me now? - But when it comes to younger voters, the other big scandal \u2013 the president misleading voters about his expansion of domestic surveillance \u2013 is likely just as important.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz reacts to members of the media attempting to justify why their reporting is so negative towards Donald Trump The media\u2019s legions of Trump-bashers are finally acknowledging the obvious. And trying their best to justify it. But there\u2019s one problem: Tilting against one candidate in a presidential election can\u2019t be justified. This is not a defense of Donald Trump, who has been at war with much of the press since he got in the race. Too many people think if you criticize the way the billionaire is being covered, you are somehow backing Trump. And it\u2019s not about the commentators, on the right as well as the left, who are savaging Trump, since they are paid for their opinions. This is about the mainstream media\u2019s reporters, editors and producers, whose credo is supposed to be fairness. And now some of them are flat-out making the case for unfairness\u2014an unprecedented approach for an unprecedented campaign. Put aside, for the moment, the longstanding complaints about journalists being unfair to Republicans. They never treated Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush or Bob Dole like this. Keep in mind that the media utterly misjudged Trump from the start, covering him as a joke or a sideshow or a streaking comet that would burn itself out. Many of them later confessed how wrong they had been, and that they had missed the magnitude of the anger and frustration that fueled Trump\u2019s unlikely rise. But since the conventions, and fueled by his own missteps, Trump has been hit by a tsunami of negative coverage, all but swamping the reporting on Hillary Clinton. Liberal investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald recently told Slate that \u201cthe U.S. media is essentially 100 percent united, vehemently, against Trump, and preventing him from being elected president\u201d\u2014and, given his views, he has no problem with that. Now comes Jim Rutenberg, in his first season as media columnist for the New York Times. He\u2019s a good reporter and I give him credit for trying to openly grapple with this bizarre situation. But Rutenberg is, in my view, trying to defend the indefensible: \u201cIf you view a Trump presidency as something that\u2019s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you\u2019ve ever been to being oppositional. That\u2019s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, nonopinion journalist I\u2019ve ever known, and by normal standards, untenable.\u201d Yet normal standards, says Rutenberg, may not apply. By \u201ccloser to being oppositional,\u201d he means openly siding against Trump and thereby helping Clinton. And that\u2019s precisely the kind of thing that erodes our already damaged credibility. If a reporter believes Trump is a threat to America, he or she should go into the opinion business, or quit the media world and work against him. You can\u2019t maintain the fig leaf of neutral reporting and favor one side. Rutenberg acknowledges that \u201cbalance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy. For the primaries and caucuses, the imbalance played to his advantage, captured by the killer statistic of the season: His nearly $2 billion in free media was more than six times as much as that of his closest Republican rival.\u201d I have to push back on this $2-billion argument. Trump got more coverage not just because he was good for clicks and ratings, but because he did many, many times more interviews than anyone else running. Much of this \u201cfree\u201d media, rather than being a gift, was harshly negative. But that too helped Trump, because he drove the campaign dialogue and openly campaigned against the press. Next Rutenberg argues that Trump is just too over the top in his rhetoric: \u201cAnd while coded appeals to racism or nationalism aren\u2019t new \u2014 two words: Southern strategy \u2014 overt calls to temporarily bar Muslims from entry to the United States or questioning a federal judge\u2019s impartiality based on his Mexican heritage are new.\u201d What\u2019s disappointing is that Rutenberg doesn\u2019t cite a single example of biased coverage from his paper, or any other paper or news outlet. (He does point to criticism from MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who is, as the columnist acknowledges, a commentator.) Instead he quotes Carolyn Ryan, the Times\u2019 senior editor for politics, as saying Trump\u2019s candidacy is \u201cextraordinary and precedent-shattering\u201d and \u201cto pretend otherwise is to be disingenuous with readers.\u201d And Rutenberg agrees, saying it would \u201cbe an abdication of political journalism\u2019s most solemn duty: to ferret out what the candidates will be like in the most powerful office in the world.\u201d No one wants to abdicate that duty. No one is pretending Trump\u2019s candidacy isn\u2019t extraordinary. No one is saying he shouldn\u2019t be fully vetted. But there is an assumption among many journalists and pundits that of course Hillary Clinton is qualified, she\u2019s been around forever, she just doesn\u2019t need the relentless reporting that Trump requires. And so critical stories about Clinton\u2014even when she said she \u201cshort-circuited\u201d in that Chris Wallace interview on the email mess\u2014are overshadowed by the endless piling on Trump. Many of the reporters who feel compelled to stop Trump are undoubtedly comfortable because all their friends feel the same way. But they are deluding themselves if they think that going after one candidate in a two-candidate race is what journalism is about.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on pundits' tendency to assume Donald Trump has no chance of winning the election If Donald Trump can continue to gain ground in a few key states by next Tuesday, he will win the presidency. I\u2019m not making any predictions. I\u2019m not for or against Trump. He still faces an uphill climb, given the Democrats\u2019 inherent Electoral College advantage, and would need to grab a major blue state. But with polling gains in such states as Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire, Trump has enough of a path that with four days to go, he still has a shot. How, one might ask, is that possible, given the extraordinary media avalanche that has tried to bury him? How can he still be competitive after most of the country\u2019s newspapers and magazines have not just opposed him, but said he is utterly beyond the pale as a plausible president? What does that say about the media? It is beyond dispute that Trump has drawn far more coverage, and far more negative coverage than Hillary Clinton, and that some media critics have applauded this imbalance. And the public gets it. Check out this USA Today poll: \u201cBy nearly 10-1, all those surveyed say the news media, including major newspapers and TV stations, would like to see Clinton rather than Trump elected. That includes 82 percent of Trump supporters and 74 percent of Clinton supporters.\u201d On the opinion side, this will give you the flavor of the media opposition. A New York Times editorial says that from the moment he got in the race, \u201cit became clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.\u201d A Washington Post editorial: \u201cMr. Trump\u2026has shown himself to be bigoted, ignorant, deceitful, narcissistic, vengeful, petty, misogynistic, fiscally reckless, intellectually lazy, contemptuous of democracy and enamored of America\u2019s enemies. As president, he would pose a grave danger to the nation and the world.\u201d Trump has also been opposed by papers that never endorse, like USA Today; by papers that have never backed a Democrat, like the Arizona Republic (126 years); by magazines that haven\u2019t endorsed in 52 years, like the Atlantic. Plus, Trump has much of the conservative media establishment, including National Review and the Weekly Standard, doggedly against him. Now the GOP nominee, for his part, has run hard against the \u201cdisgustingly dishonest\u201d media. And obviously the media, for all their agenda-setting influence, don\u2019t control the outcome of elections. But what does it say that most of the media establishment is so relentlessly negative against a guy who is going to win at least 20 states and possibly more? To me, it goes back to the way the MSM originally dismissed Trump as a sideshow and a joke, a guy who deserved to be in the Huffington Post\u2019s Entertainment section. But it goes far deeper than that. The reason the media missed the rise of Trump is that they were out of touch with the anger and frustration of so many voters, especially working-class Americans. And even now, there is too little empathy for these voters and too little understanding of what motivates them, especially in certain precincts of New York, Washington and L.A. Instead, there is plenty of condescension toward these voters, a feeling that they\u2019re racist or xenophobic or just so ill-informed that they don\u2019t realize that Trump is selling them snake oil. Here is Times columnist Charles Blow declaring Trump an \u201cexistential threat,\u201d declaring \u201cwith my last breath: America, are you (expletive) kidding?! \u201cI simply cannot wrap my head around how others with level heads and sound minds can even consider Trump for president of this country and leader of the free world.\u201d What a message: America, you must be dumb or crazy to support this guy. Beginning next Wednesday, there will be plenty of hand-wringing about the ugly campaign, the Clinton investigations, the future of the Republican Party and so on.

            "article_content": "White House reporter for the Associated Press Josh Lederman explains why both nominees are 'retrenching behind their most vicious attacks' Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both faced side battles on the campaign trail Tuesday, with one having to denounce an unwanted quasi-endorsement and the other having to spar with a heckler at her rally. The Trump campaign denounced an apparent endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan publication \"The Crusader.\" The paper\u2019s front page read \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d a slogan used by Trump during the election season. \u201cYou can see it on the shirts, buttons, posters and ball caps. \u2026 But can it happen? Can America really be great again? This is what we will soon find out!\u201d it read. The campaign denounced the support in a statement later. \u201cThis publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign.\u201d Thomas Robb, the paper\u2019s editor, told The Washington Post that it wasn\u2019t necessarily an endorsement of Trump. \u201cOverall, we do like his nationalist views and his words about shutting down the border to illegal aliens. It\u2019s not an endorsement because, like anybody, there\u2019s things you disagree with,\u201d Robb said.\u00a0 \u201cBut he kind of reflects what\u2019s happening throughout the world. There seems to be a surge of nationalism worldwide as nationals reclaim their borders.\u201d Meanwhile, Clinton was speaking at a campaign rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. when a heckler shouted \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist!\u201d and waved a sign that echoed his statement. Clinton wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cI am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and the anger of people who support Donald Trump,\u201d she said. According to the New York Post, similar protesters aren\u2019t uncommon at Clinton rallies. But it\u2019s rare for her to respond to them. As the election looms, both candidates are anticipated to increase the heated rhetoric that has driven the campaign. Clinton turned her attention Tuesday to focus on Trump\u2019s comments on women, calling him a bully. This time she brought with her former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight after winning the 1996 contest. Trump, while in Pennsylvania Tuesday, warned that electing Clinton would \"destroy American health care forever.\" Clinton's and Trump's closing campaign advertisements reiterate the race's sharply negative tone. Her campaign has several commercials out that directly question whether Trump would launch a nuclear attack. The ads feature clips of him saying he likes to be unpredictable and would \"bomb the (expletive) out of them.\" She's also doubled down on her argument that Trump's offensive comments about women, as well as his boasts about touching women without their permission, disqualify him from the White House. A 60-second ad that features Trump in his own words over the years concludes: \"Anyone who believes, anyone who says, anyone who does what he does, is unfit to be president.\" Meanwhile, Trump's ads reinforce his message that the country risks doom if it doesn't change directions by electing him. \"Hillary Clinton will keep us on the road to stagnation,\" a narrator says in one of his latest ads.

            "article_content": "Prime Minister David Cameron keeps his job British Prime Minister David Cameron and his Tory party's decisive victory in parliamentary elections likely has President Obama breathing a sigh of relief, with analysts saying the win virtually ensures the continuation of vital U.K. support in fighting the Islamic State and other security matters. \"You need to have a very strong, robust Britain on the world stage,\" said Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom with the Heritage Foundation. \"I think it's very important that the United States has alongside it a leader who is willing to take on and fight against the Islamist extremists.\" Cameron's party defied the polls, which predicted a tight race that could leave the balance of power in Britain's Parliament up in the air. There had been a distinct possibility that, with nobody winning a clear majority, the center-left Labour Party would be able to cobble together a coalition with other parties not so hawkish on military matters as Cameron and the Conservatives. Instead, Cameron's Conservative Party won an unexpected majority. After meeting with Queen Elizabeth II on Friday afternoon, Cameron returned to his office to announce he would form a majority Conservative government. Obama may actually have more in common with Labour's Ed Miliband, both of them left-leaning politicians. Yet while Cameron is more fiscally conservative than Obama on many fronts, Obama and Cameron have nevertheless developed a close alliance, even a friendship, in addressing their shared challenges. Their two governments are cooperating in ongoing nuclear talks with Iran and, importantly, in the international fight against Islamic terrorism. Pollster and Fox News contributor Frank Luntz, in London, said Cameron is now the \"undisputed leader.\" \"It's very important for U.S. foreign policy,\" he said. \"This will continue Britain's support for what the U.S. is doing to challenge ISIS, support for Israel. It's a very significant win for the U.S., and it's a very significant win for people who are right of center in Europe and America.\" Cameron is known for taking a hard line against Islamic radicalism, speaking more bluntly about the challenge than Obama. Gardiner noted that, \"he clearly identifies the nature of the Islamist threat, in contrast to President Obama.\" Gardiner said, \"He believes we are engaged in a global war with Islamist extremism.\" Despite the rhetorical differences in Obama and Cameron's approaches, the two countries have been key partners in airstrikes against ISIS over Iraq, with the U.K. one of the biggest contributors. The U.K. has contributed to surveillance missions as well. In a statement on Friday, Obama congratulated Cameron on his \"impressive electoral victory\" and cited their strong working relationship. \"I look forward to continuing to strengthen the bonds between our countries, as we work together on behalf of global peace, security and prosperity,\" he said. One potential trouble-spot is that the Conservatives have promised a referendum on leaving the European Union, which could be problematic for the United States. In a political sideshow of the election, it also involved former Obama advisers working on different sides. Ex-campaign manager Jim Messina worked for Cameron, while ex-adviser David Axelrod worked for Miliband. After the results came in, Cameron promised to govern as the party of \"one nation, one United Kingdom.\" With the Conservatives winning an outright majority in the 650-seat House of Commons, the election result looked to be far better for him than even his own party had foreseen. With 643 constituencies counted, the Conservatives had 326 seats to Labour's 230. The prime minister beamed early Friday as he was announced the winner of his Witney constituency in southern England. \"This is clearly a very strong night for the Conservative Party,\" he said. Cameron, who would be the first Conservative prime minister to win a second term since Margaret Thatcher, vowed to counter the rise of Scottish nationalism with more powers for Scotland and Wales. \"I want my party, and I hope a government that I would like to lead, to reclaim a mantle that we should never have lost -- the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom,\" he said. Labour was routed in Scotland by the Scottish National Party, which took almost all of the 59 seats. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC that the vote represented \"a clear voice for an end to austerity, better public services and more progressive politics at Westminster.\" Britain's economy -- recovering after years of turmoil that followed the 2008 financial crisis -- was at the core of many voters' concerns. The results suggest that many heeded Cameron's entreaties to back the Conservatives as the party of financial stability. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster: Trump unbound - Time Out: Ride the lightning - Pressure grows on Clintons to shutter foundation - Power Play: What matters this August - You\u2019re doing it wrongTRUMP UNBOUND It looks like Trump may finally get to be Trump again. After a months-long struggle to make peace with the GOP, Republican nominee Donald Trump is going his own way with a new campaign boss who reflects Trump\u2019s own trans-partisan mojo. Just listen to Trump\u2019s lines about \u201cpeaceful regime change\u201d at his Milwaukee rally on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m fighting for real change, not partisan change where everyone else gets rich but you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have said it first and I will say it for a long time: We are probably going to break that system.\u201d Leaving aside the un-Trumpish note of \u201cprobably,\u201d that is a line that could have electrified a Bernie Sanders rally. The Trump campaign, like Sanders\u2019, is about the revolt of the white working class \u2013 left, right and in between. And Trump may finally be getting a campaign to support that message. There is much supposition as to why Trump tapped Steve Bannon, the head of pro-Trump site Breitbart News, to lead his campaign and why he did so in such a sudden move. The timing of the pick may be explained by the rapidly declining fortunes of Paul Manafort, the GOP establishmentarian who took over Trump\u2019s campaign in a springtime shakeup designed to placate Republican donors. It seemed like the writing was on the wall for Manafort after he succeeded in pushing the shotgun marriage between Trump and the aggressively conventional governor of Indiana, Mike Pence. Manafort toppled Trump loyalist Corey Lewandoski and then succeeded in forcing Trump to act more like a Republican. But the problem with coups is that you\u2019re always looking over your shoulder. As Manafort was being supplanted, yet another story about his ties to Putinist Russia was hitting the wires. From his work in Eastern Europe, Manafort should have known well what becomes of inconvenient political advisors. And after a weeks-long skid in the polls, Manafort was looking more inconvenient than a two-story outhouse. But the pick of Bannon is no mystery. Under Bannon, Breitbart has championed the idea of preserving white American cultural identity in the face of an increasingly diverse population. \u00a0Withering attacks on free trade and Muslim migration further suggest this strong connection to ethnic and cultural, rather than ideological, conservatism. Nationalism, long freighted with the ugly connotations of the World War II era, is making a comeback. And Bannon\u2019s Breitbart and Trump have found common cause in it. And Trump now knows that he doesn\u2019t need the GOP cash machine. He showed last month that he can shuck plenty of cash out of his core supporters with small-dollar online contributions, just as Sanders did with his seemingly unending candidacy. Trump\u2019s self-generated funds will be a pittance compared to those of Hillary Clinton, but they will be more than enough to keep him flying across the country and retaining the requisite paid staff to hold events, deal with the press and produce and place some ads. Trump was always going to lag Clinton on cash, even with the party. It\u2019s just that now he can meet the minimum financial requirements without the headaches of trying to please Republicans. But Trump will also soon see more Republicans abandon his cause. The Tuesday shakeup will disquiet party elders and some in the rank and file \u2013 especially as Trump keeps up the \u201cregime change\u201d talk. The Republican nominee will continue to see college educated and more affluent white voters reject his candidacy. So at this point Trump has to stick with his decision to run essentially as an independent who toppled the GOP and now wants to destroy the other party. There\u2019s no going back now. After the 2012 election, Republicans had a choice to make. Faced with the declining share of white voters, the party could either try to broaden its appeal with minorities or narrow its focus on blue-collar white voters to intensify the GOP share of the white majority. For a year or so, the party seemed determined to make a down payment on the majority-minority future with immigration legislation and concerted outreach to non-white groups. But with the capsizing of the immigration plan in 2013, it started to become clear that the supporters of broadening the base were on the losing side. Pundits scoffed at Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s claim that he could win the general election without a pivot. Cruz argued that millions of blue-collar white voters in the Upper Midwest \u2013 the archetypical Reagan Democrats \u2013 would return to the polls to vote for a staunch conservative. When Cruz launched his campaign 16 months ago few would have imagined that the GOP nominee would go far beyond even Cruz\u2019s concept of mobilizing working-class whites and alienating minority voters. But here they are. The question for Trump and Bannon now is whether they can pull it off and find a way to build their new left-right white coalition in the 12 weeks before the election.TIME OUT: RIDE THE LIGHTNING Rock critic Drew Millard examines what makes a band\u2019s work canonical, and finds that juxtaposition matters.

            "article_content": "Researchers discover long-lost HMS Terror 168-years after Sir John Franklin's doomed ship wrecked The second of two British explorer ships that vanished in the Arctic nearly 170 years ago during a storied expedition to find the fabled Northwest Passage has been found. The Arctic Research Foundation said Monday that the HMS Terror has been located by a research ship. Last seen in the 1840s while under the command of Sir John Franklin, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror have long been among the most sought-after prizes in marine archaeology and the subject of songs, poems and novels. The wreck of the Erebus was found in 2014. \"Terror was found on Sept 3. It is a perfect time capsule,\" said Adrian Schimnowski, the expedition leader of the research ship that located the HMS Terror. The Terror was discovered in 26 yards of water in Terror Bay, a small indentation on the coast of King William Island west of the community of Gjoa Haven. It was located right where an Inuit hunter said it would be. Canadian Rear-Admiral John Newton said the two Franklin ships were found about 31 miles apart from each other. Franklin and 128 hand-picked officers and men had set out in 1845 to find the Northwest Passage, the long-sought shortcut to Asia that supposedly ran from the Atlantic to the Pacific by way of the harsh, ice-choked Arctic. The death of all 129 men made the Franklin expedition the worst tragedy in the history of Arctic exploration. Schimnowski said that mystery might have remained if not for a late-night conversation on one of the search vessels between himself and Sammy Kogvik, an Inuk and Canadian Ranger from Gjoa Haven. The two were on the bridge of the Martin Bergmann, a research vessel, and Kogvik was telling Schimnowski about the history of the shorelines they were sailing past. He started talking about something he had seen seven years ago while snowmobiling across the sea ice of Terror Bay. Kogvik recalled how he had looked behind him to check on his hunting partner when he spotted a large pole sticking up out of the ice. The two Inuit stopped and took pictures of what looked like a ship's mast. But when Kogvik got home to Gjoa Haven, he found he had dropped his camera and lost the shots. \"He kept the story secret because he didn't want people not to believe him,\" Schimnowski said. \"We listened to Sammy's story on the bridge of the Bergmann and changed course to take a look,\" he said. In a news release, Kogvik said he was delighted to see the vessel again. In the days since the discovery, the crew has identified a number of the Terror\u2019s features. There is video of the ship's bell. A cannon similar to those on the Erebus has been spotted. The ship's helm is still there \"in perfect condition,\" said Schimnowski. A windlass, used to haul up an anchor, still has heavy rope wrapped around it as if moored to the bottom of the sea. Newton called it an historic site for Canada and said there are no current plans to raise the two ships. John Geiger, president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, called the discovery of the HMS Terror the missing piece of the puzzle and historically significant for Americans given the role of the HMS Terror in the War of 1812. HMS Terror was one of the British naval bomb ships that took part in the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Battle of Baltimore in September 1814. The attack was the inspiration for the poem by Francis Scott Key that eventually became known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" \"Those bombs could have very well been lobbed from the Terror,\" he said. \"It's fundamental to the Star-Spangled Banner and the origins of the anthem of the United States. From a pure historical standpoint what an exciting find.\" The confirmation of the HMS Erebus find in 2014 was made by underwater archaeologists, following a meticulous review of data and artifacts observed from the Arctic Ocean's seabed and using high-resolution photography, high-definition video and multi-beam sonar measurements. Canada announced in 2008 that it would look for the ships, and the Canadian government has poured millions of dollars into the venture, with former Prime Minister Stephen Harper himself taking part in the search. It was all part of Harper's plan to boast Canadian nationalism and a sense of ownership of the north. Harper's government made the project a top priority as it looked to assert Canada's sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, where melting Arctic ice in recent years has unlocked the very shipping route Franklin was seeking. Canada says it owns the passage. The U.S. and others say it is international territory. The well-preserved wreck of HMS Erebus was found 12 yards below the surface, near King William Island, about 1,200 miles \u00a0northwest of Toronto. Historians believe that the ships got trapped in thick ice in 1846 off Prince William Island, and Franklin and some other crew members died in the ensuing months. The survivors apparently abandoned the two ships in April 1848 in a hopeless bid to reach safety overland. Inuit lore tells of \"white men who were starving\" as late as the winter of 1850 on the Royal Geographical Society Island near Prince William Island. For many years afterward, Franklin was celebrated as a Victorian-era hero. Dozens of searches by the British and Americans in the 1800s failed to locate the wrecks, and some of those expeditions also ended in tragedy. But they opened up parts of the Canadian Arctic to discovery and ultimately found a Northwest Passage, though it proved inhospitable to shipping because of ice and treacherous weather. The search for an Arctic passage to Asia frustrated explorers for centuries, beginning with John Cabot's voyage in 1497. The shortcut eluded other famous explorers, including Henry Hudson and Francis Drake. No sea crossing was successful until Roald Amundsen of Norway completed his trip in 1903-06. The exact location of Erebus was not disclosed for fear of looters. The research ship was part of a small flotilla organized by the Canadian government and its partners that sailed for the Arctic at the end of August to search for the HMS Terror.",

Excerpts of the speeches given in the years before her 2016 presidential campaign included some blunt and unguarded remarks to her private audiences, which collectively had paid her at least $26.1 million in speaking fees. Clinton had refused to release transcripts of the speeches, despite repeated calls to do so by her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. The excerpts were included in emails exchanged among her political staff, including Campaign Chairman John Podesta, whose email account was hacked. The WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of Podesta's emails. It wasn't immediately clear who had hacked Podesta's emails, though the breach appeared to cover years of messages, some sent as recently as last month. Among the emails was a compilation of excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches in 2013 and 2014. It appeared campaign staff had read all Clinton's speeches and identified passages that could be potentially problematic for the candidate if they were to become public. One excerpt put Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has retreated on significantly during the 2016 election. In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her \"dream\" is \"a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\" and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \"would mean for everybody in this room.\" Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has made opposition to trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign. Podesta posted a series of tweets Friday night, calling the disclosures a Russian hack and raising questions about whether some of the documents could have been altered. \"I'm not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\" Podesta wrote. \"Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\" Podesta's comments came just hours after U.S. officials publicly accused the Russian government of directing cyberattacks on political organizations and American citizens in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections. The joint statement from the office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department cited disclosures of \"alleged hacked emails\" on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks as being \"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\" The statement didn't refer by name to the affected political institutions, but federal authorities are investigating cyberattacks on the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, \"It's not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret.\" The emails released Friday included exchanges between Podesta and other Clinton insiders, including campaign manager Robby Mook. Most were routine, including drafts of Clinton speeches, suggested talking points for campaign surrogates and suggested tweets to be sent out from Clinton's account. The excerpts include quotes from an October 2013 speech at an event sponsored by Goldman Sachs, in which Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. \"Running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it,\" Clinton said. \"New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it's also our economic center. And there are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.\" In the same speech, Clinton was also deferential to the New York finance industry, exhorting wealthy donors to use their political clout for patriotic rather than personal benefit. She also spoke of the need to include Wall Street perspectives in financial reform. \"The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\" Clinton said. In an April 2013 speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council, Clinton said politicians must balance \"both a public and a private position\" while making deals. Clinton gave an example from the movie \"Lincoln,\" and the deal-making that went into passage of the 13th Amendment, a process she compared to sausage-making. \"It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be,\" Clinton said. \"But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\" Clinton's speeches often touched on technology and privacy. In an April 2014 speech to JPMorgan, she denounced National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for going abroad, saying, \"if he really cared about raising some of these issues and stayed right here in the United States, there's a lot of whistleblower protections.\" But she told her audience that her time in the public eye left her sympathetic to privacy concerns. \"As somebody who has had my privacy scrutinized and violated for decades, I'm all for privacy, believe me,\" she said. Speaking on international affairs, Clinton's comments were largely in line with her positions as secretary of state, if sometimes more blunt. \"The Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on Earth over the course of the last 30 years,\" she told the Jewish United Fund at a 2013 dinner. The speech transcripts were produced under an agreement Clinton routinely imposed on any organization that hired her to speak. The contracts, such as ones crafted by the Harry Walker Agency, required the organizations to hire, at their own expense, a stenographer who would provide the transcripts to Clinton and not keep copies for themselves. In some cases, the contracts themselves were obtained by news organizations under public records laws because Clinton was being paid to speak by public universities or colleges.",

            "article_content": "Former House speaker urges the Republican nominee to focus on the issues amid new allegations against him We finally know why Hillary Clinton refused to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to bankers and special interests: When her staff assembled a list of the most damaging comments in those transcripts, they must have seen immediately that they could not afford for the material ever to be made public. In one speech, Hillary described how politicians often \u201cneed both a public and a private position.\u201d She elaborated that at times, Abraham Lincoln had a public position that was different from the private, secret goal he was actually pursuing. The list of speech excerpts, in emails made public this month by WikiLeaks, didn\u2019t require us to look far to discover Hillary Clinton\u2019s own secret goal. In a secret, $225,000 speech to Brazilian bankers in 2013, she let her mask down revealed the goal she truly wants to pursue. Hillary\u2019s dream of open borders would send the wages and incomes of millions of Americans into a free fall. \u201cMy dream,\u201d she said, \u201cis a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.\u201d In other words, open borders and open trade for the entire hemisphere\u2014all of the countries in North and South America. Not just her hope. Not just her wish. Her dream. Let\u2019s consider the implications of Hillary\u2019s dream. Hillary wants an open border with Canada and an open border with Mexico, our two closest neighbors. She also wants open borders with and among all of the countries in Central America and South America. In addition to open borders with all of those countries, she us to have open trade with them, so that all of their people can choose to live and work in the United States if they please. There are about 210 million people in North America outside the United States, including the entire populations of Mexico and Canada. There are 42 million people in Central America\u2014the seven countries from Guatemala to Panama, some of which are among the most violent places on Earth. There are 422 million people in South America\u2014more than the entire population of the United States. How many of those roughly 675 million people do you think would like to come and work in the U.S.? Hillary\u2019s dream of open borders would send the wages and incomes of millions of Americans into a free fall. At the same time, it would mean an explosion of welfare costs for the states and federal government. Hillary\u2019s dream would literally drive Americans, and America, bankrupt. But it\u2019s not just our jobs and our economy that Hillary\u2019s dream would destroy. Consider what else this radical vision of open borders would mean. It would mean we\u2019d have no capacity to stop terrorists from entering the United States. ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other terrorists could come in through any one of more than two dozen countries, and make their way freely to the U.S. We\u2019d have no capacity to stop Mexican heroin and Columbian cocaine, or gangs, like the violent and vicious MS-13 from El Salvador. And it would mean no capacity to stop the spread of diseases from around the world into the United States. For most Americans, this isn\u2019t a dream. It\u2019s a warning of a future that could be all too real. Because if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, she\u2019d have the power to make these ambitions a reality. She would only have to continue and expand President Obama\u2019s policies of deliberate non-enforcement of our immigration laws. There would be no check on Hillary\u2019s power to realize her dream of open borders\u2014and for millions of families, that would mean the destruction of the American dream.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the media's attempts to say Donald Trump is easily handing the election to Hillary Clinton, but who is the real candidate who is choking? Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time to (cough) focus on choking. And by that, I don\u2019t mean Hillary Clinton\u2019s coughing spell the other day, which sparked some of the old conspiracy chatter about her health (and #HackingHillary quickly became a top Twitter trend). And it led to these eight stacked headlines on the Drudge Report: 10 Doctors Question Hillary Health...  MSNBC Cuts Live Feed as She Sputters For Air... FIT LASTED OVER 4 MINUTES...  She slams 'conspiracy theories'... Media Blame Pollen...  Complete timeline of 2016 coughing fits... PRUDEN: Voters have right to ask... Thyroid problems linked to sudden cardiac death... Oh, and Donald Trump tried as well, tweeting: \u201cMainstream media never covered Hillary\u2019s massive 'hacking' or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What\u2019s up?\u201d (Trending topics are the new assignment editor!) Clinton, for her part, told reporters on her plane\u2014actually taking a number of questions from her press corps for the first time this year\u2014that she would not be distracted by rumors about her health. No, I\u2019m talking about choking as the term is used in sports: the 9th-inning strikeout, the dropped pass in the end zone, the clunker off the rim as time expires on the clock. The trash talk started with Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico. John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, ripped Trump for saying he and Enrique Pena Nieto did not discuss his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it,\u201d Podesta said. (The \u201clying\u201d allegation relates to Pena Nieto saying he had told Trump his country would never pay, but Trump may have been referring to his decision not to negotiate.) Trump fired back yesterday, using the same verb, on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d: \"So let me just tell you about choking. I don't choke. She chokes. Look at the deals she's made. She's responsible for so many bad things that have happened to our country, including the signing by her husband of NAFTA, which has drained our country of its jobs. I've been given A-plus, including by you people ... I have been given A-pluses for the job I did in Mexico.\u201d Now there\u2019s a serious issue beneath the locker-room jibes: Who can withstand the pressures of the presidency? It\u2019s reminiscent of the 3 a.m. phone call ad that Clinton ran against Barack Obama eight years ago. The charges and countercharges have been flying fast and furious in the last 48 hours. Clinton, on her plane\u2014and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s finally taking press questions\u2014said Trump must have something to hide in not releasing his tax returns. Trump said Monday that \u201cI think people don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think anybody cares, except some members of the press.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that every presidential nominee since Richard Nixon has released tax records. Clinton also said she must be creating jobs in the \u201cconspiracy theory machine factory.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, has been hammering away at questions surrounding the Clinton Foundation. In an echo of that earlier Hillary ad, his communications chief Jason Miller said: \u201cWhen that 3 a.m. phone call comes, we can\u2019t have an ethically-challenged president on the line who took truckloads of cash from other countries.\u201d And discussing Russia yesterday, Trump said: \u201cPutin looks at her and he laughs, OK? He laughs. Putin. Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles.\u201d The intensified pace comes as the media are gradually acknowledging that the polls are tightening. I wrote yesterday that the media narrative was lagging behind the surveys showing Trump closing the gap in national numbers. And yesterday, a new CNN poll gave Trump a 2-point lead over Clinton, or within the margin of error. No wonder the candidates are accusing each other of coughing, choking and caving in.",

The Canadian-born American citizen, and Republican presidential candidate, was the butt of two north-of-the-border jabs this week. Ahead of Tuesday's 2016 debate, the Democratic Party\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted it was so excited it forgot to wish Cruz a happy Canadian Thanksgiving. Then on Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest invoked Cruz again as he celebrated his hometown Kansas City Royals reaching the American League Championship Series where they will face the Toronto Blue Jays. \u201cI certainly was pleased to see the Royals advance by defeating the Houston Astros last night, and they're ready to take on Ted Cruz\u2019s other hometown team, the Toronto Blue Jays, next,\u201d Earnest said to laughter from the press corps. The Texas senator and 2016 presidential hopeful was born in Calgary -- not Toronto -- in 1970, while his parents were working in the oil business. The remarks may be in jest, but with Cruz polling in the middle of the GOP primary pack, and one of the Republicans leading the race for campaign donations, it's possible the Democrats are trying to lay the foundation for a more serious attack. \"I think this is just sort of like, 'Don't worry we're going to raise this if you become the nominee we're going to make an issue of this' even though the history and the precedent of the Naturalization Act of 1790 makes it pretty clear that this would be perfectly OK,\" columnist Liz Peek told FoxNews.com LIVE. \"So I don't think it's totally a jest.\" Ted Cruz's campaign declined to comment.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, is accompanied by his running mate, Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, during a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday October 22, 2016. (AP Photo / Evan Vucci) Here\u2019s the astonishing truth the media\u2019s not talking about and Democrats refuse to believe \u2014 Donald Trump is getting more than double, and sometimes more than triple, the black vote Romney got 4 years ago. Recent polling by Remington Research shows Trump getting 22% in Florida, Romney got 5 percent. In North Carolina, Trump\u2019s getting 19%, Romney got 4 percent.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s getting 22% of black voters in Wisconsin compared with Romney\u2019s 6% 4 years ago.\u00a0 And in Pennsylvania, Trump scores an astounding 29% against Romney\u2019s 7% share in 2012. Nationally, Romney received less than 7% of the black vote in 2012.\u00a0 Even Trump\u2019s worst numbers among African-Americans show him getting 19%, and some polls show him doing much better. Even more exciting for Republican prospects, increasing black support is not confined to Trump.\u00a0 In Wisconsin, Ron Johnson has pulled even in his race for re-election to the U.S. Senate thanks largely to black defection from the Democrat party.\u00a0 A CNN poll shows Rob Portman getting 32% of non-white voters in Ohio, mostly African Americans.\u00a0 In North Carolina, a Quinnipiac Poll shows Richard Burr gets 24% of the ethnic vote, most of them African Americans. Generally, there are three reasons African-Americans are voting in record numbers for Republicans this year. First, for the first time since anyone can remember, Republicans have broken the communications monopoly Democrats have enjoyed among African-Americans. Trump is persistently reaching out to them; visiting their churches and neighborhoods, making a commitment to rebuild America\u2019s cities, economy and jobs. Second, Trump\u2019s not the only one speaking to African Americans. The organization I am honored to Chair, the 2016 Committee \u2014 best known for our successful effort to draft Dr. Ben Carson into the presidential race \u2014 has, in the last three months, raised and spent more than $1.3 million in 6 battleground states on radio ads targeted to African American voters.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s an ad effort focused on Trump, but providing real value for Republicans down-ticket as well. Our ad campaign is based on concrete test data. In fact, the predecessor to The 2016 Committee, the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, ran a test of this approach in the North Carolina Senate race two years ago which pit incumbent Kay Hagen against challenger Thom Tillis. We ran radio ads for 8 weeks in that part of North Carolina where just under two-thirds of African Americans live.\u00a0 Radio ads were not run in the northern tier of the state on the Virginia border, nor in the southern crescent adjacent to the South Carolina border. Rasmussen polling before the ads started showed that Kay Hagen was winning 99% of the African American vote -- about the same support she received in 2008 with Barack Obama at the top of the ticket.\u00a0 A few weeks after the ads started running polls indicated a notable shift in black voter preference. On election day, exit polls taken by Rasmussen showed Thom Tillis received 11.9% of the African-American vote statewide.\u00a0 This is clearly a result of the more than $300,000 worth of radio ads run by the Committee. As further validation, Tillis received precisely the result you\u2019d expect if he won 1% of the black vote where the ads did not run and 18% in the areas where ads could be heard. The third and most significant reason for the shift in African- American voter preferences this year is African-Americans have grown weary of shopworn liberal policies aimed at buying black votes while limiting black opportunity and prosperity. Hillary promises to double down on those failed policies. The 2016 Committee\u2019s radio ads make the case with examples from three broad issue areas:\u00a0 education, jobs and abortion. Our ads show how Hillary\u2019s unconditional support for teachers\u2019 unions and opposition to charter schools condemn poor children to continuing poverty. We discuss Hillary\u2019s support for higher taxes, more regulation and bigger government \u2014 the liberal trifecta that restricts minorities to the economic hole leftist policies have anchored them in, prohibits job growth in the private sector, and guarantees deteriorating living conditions. And we point out that despite boasting of her work for kids, she defends abortion in horrifically painful ways right up to the last hour even though one of three babies aborted in America is black.\u00a0 How can she take for granted black votes when she isn\u2019t interested in protecting the lives of black babies? Those who claim a Trump win depends entirely on his running the board with white voters are missing a historic shift in party alignment that will profoundly impact American politics. Given the growing desperation of minorities victimized by liberal policies for the last 6 decades, it can\u2019t happen soon enough.",

            "article_content": "William la Jeunesse reports from the border at Yuma, Arizona YUMA, Arizona \u2013 When Americans think of a secure border, whether they know it or not, they see Yuma, Ariz., and the 20-foot high steel curtain separating it from Mexico. Beyond the imposing wall is 75 yards of flat, sandy, no man\u2019s land, monitored by cameras and sensors and agents in SUVs. If an illegal immigrant successfully runs that gauntlet, they face another tightly woven steel fence and a third cyclone fence topped by barbed wire. \u201cIt works,\u201d said Border Patrol Agent Richard Withers. \u201cThis is the most secure area of the border. It is pretty hard for a guy to cross here. But they try.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always this way. In 2005, Yuma was chaos. Pushed out of San Diego by Operation Gatekeeper in the late 1990s, drug and human smugglers targeted San Luis, a sleepy little border town just over the California state line south of Yuma. \"It is pretty hard for a guy to cross here. But they try.\u201d That year, illegal immigrants overwhelmed Yuma. Border agents made on average 800 arrests a day, and watched hundreds of suspects run away. Stolen vehicles laden with drugs raced over the border at high speeds unhindered and unmolested. An estimated eight trucks a day sped out of Mexico onto Interstate 8 and disappeared into the American heartland, stuffed with immigrants or drugs. \u201cIt was the Wild West out here,\u201d said Yuma sector chief Anthony Porvaznik. Video of the Yuma chaos made its way to Washington, where then-President George Bush pledged to fix it. In 2006, Congress passed the Secure Fence Act. Three years later every mile of Yuma\u2019s border with Mexico contained a fence or vehicle barrier. \u201cWe essentially apprehend 92 percent of all entries through the Yuma sector,\u201d said Porvaznik, as he steered a white and green Chevy Tahoe through the sand. \u201cThat is 126 miles of border, which includes 12 miles of these sand dunes. On a scale of 1 to 10 we are a 9.\u201d Today, Yuma has triple the manpower and apprehends just 15 illegal immigrants a day, a 96 percent reduction. Instead of 2,700 vehicle penetrations, this year\u2019s total is just 27. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet here,\u201d Withers said. While the fence is the most important factor in Yuma\u2019s success, Porvaznik said it isn\u2019t the only one. \u201cUnless you give them a reason not to come back, they will,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we started Operation Streamline, fewer deportees tried to cross. It was simple. They didn\u2019t want to go to jail. Our first-time offenders went to jail for 15 days.\u00a0 We took them out of their smuggling cycle.\u201d Porvaznik said some immigrants quit, while others just moved farther into the desert where the fence ended. And that\u2019s the challenge of border security. Unless every mile is protected, smugglers and would-be illegal immigrants simply find a soft spot and exploit it. \u201cIt used to be overwhelming,\u201d said veteran agent Tomas Diaz.\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t as active, but we still see the Mexicans trying to swim across, or they get smuggled in little boats.\u201d Diaz pilots one of two Customs and Border Protection boats on the Colorado River where it empties into Mexico. The CBP also has airplanes, helicopters and drones backing up the agents, giving agents greater awareness even when they can\u2019t catch an illegal crosser. Immigrants no longer try crossing alone. Passage is arranged and controlled by criminal organizations that charge on average $3,000 for a Mexican, $6,000 for a Central American and up to triple that for an Asian, according to sources. But the fence has also produced negative consequences. Smugglers have been forced to risk travel through the merciless Sonora desert, where only the fittest can survive the 80-mile hike from Mexico to a pick-up site. Some make it, but more than 2,000 did not in the last decade, dying from dehydration or heat stroke, according to immigrant advocate groups. Yuma\u2019s fence, along with agents who patrol the border and police and prosecutors willing to jail alien felons are a powerful example of border security could look like, if Congress and the President agreed on a goal. But the biggest draw remains employment, and agents say until the federal government is serious about interior and worksite enforcement, where employers are fined or jailed and compelled to check immigration status of employees, the problem won\u2019t go away \u2013 no matter how many billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on enforcement.",

(U.S. Customs and Border Protection) Texas authorities are on high alert after Border Patrol agents caught an alleged smuggler trying to disguise its SUV as one of the agency's vehicles, officials said Friday. Border Patrol agents caught a smuggler driving a Chevy Tahoe that was painted to look like one of the agency\u2019s vehicle, according to KRGV-TV. Vehicles are usually painted to act as delivery or telecommunications trucks to try and fool agents, but it\u2019s unusual to see a Border Patrol vehicle to be copied. Border Patrol in Laredo found 12 people stuffed in the back of the imposter vehicle. Agents knew the vehicle was a fake as soon as they found it. \u201cThere\u2019s no fender, there\u2019s no ground effect on any of our vehicles, Omar Zamora, an agent with the Border Patrol Rio Grande Valley sector, told KRGV-TV. \u201cThey\u2019re actually pretty bare and about as high as we get the vehicle, because we do go off road.\u201d Zamora said any agent would\u2019ve recognized the SUV. \u201cIn the 18 years that I\u2019ve been in the Border Patrol, we\u2019ve seen UPS, FedEx trucks, Time Warner trucks, any kind of clones. Any business you can think of. The smugglers are trying to clone it to avoid law enforcement detection,\u201d Zamora added. Zamora said the numbers and codes on each unit means something and was confident a clone couldn\u2019t conceal a crime in the region. Border Patrol said this is the first cloned unit in recent memory in the Laredo area and has urged the public to call law enforcement if they see something suspicious. Click for more from KRGV-TV.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Duncan Hunter says uncovered network raises serious security questions An Afghan national with ties to the Taliban\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and a plot to carry out a terror attack somewhere in North America\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was caught last fall after being smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico, an incident sure to further inflame the debate over national security risks at the border. The Afghan national\u2019s alleged terror ties were not initially flagged in a terror database \u2013 and as a result, not initially reported \u2013 when the incident first came to light last November, according to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who obtained Homeland Security documents on the incident. It was only later that U.S. officials discovered his associations. Hunter\u00a0told Fox News on Friday that the database disconnect represents a \u201cmonumental failure.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming into the U.S. and what they\u2019re bringing with them,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d \u201cIt is as bad as it seems.\u201d The new details were first reported by The Washington Times. According to information shared with FoxNews.com by Hunter\u2019s office, the Afghan in question was picked up and detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents about 15 miles inside Arizona from the border. He was arrested along with five Pakistani citizens and two Mexicans identified as smugglers. The Afghan claimed he crossed into the U.S. on Nov. 13, 2015 by crawling under a border fence near Nogales, Ariz. But an initial check in one of the terror databases apparently did not flag him. As a result, all six illegal immigrants \u2013 from what are known as \u201cspecial interest\u201d countries \u2013 were cleared by the National Targeting Center. According to a letter sent Wednesday from Hunter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, all six were initially served with an \u201cExpedited Removal.\u201d The Afghan national \u201csought U.S. immigration benefits, and was processed as having credible fear after he stated his life was in danger,\u201d Hunter wrote. However, according to the letter, the individual was in fact identified in a separate database, the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), as having terror ties. Hunter wrote that the individual was said to be \u201cinvolved in a plot to conduct an attack in the U.S. and/or Canada and has family ties to members of the Taliban.\u201d For an unknown reason, the individual was not initially watch-listed in the separate Terrorist Screening Database, according to the letter \u2013 and so these associations were not initially noticed. Officials apparently noticed the error in time, as the individual remains in U.S. custody in Arizona. But Hunter said in his letter to Johnson that his understanding is the whereabouts of the other men arrested that day \u201cis unknown.\u201d Hunter asked DHS for additional details. Hunter also pushed back Friday on the notion that the incident could represent a success since the Afghan national was ultimately apprehended and later flagged. \u201cYou can assume that others have gotten through,\u201d Hunter told Fox News. The information shared with FoxNews.com showed at least a dozen illegal immigrants from Afghanistan and Pakistan have either made it across the U.S. border or gotten close, dating back to 2014. The Washington Times reported that the incident last fall involved a Brazilian-based smuggling network. The Afghan national in question apparently took a complicated route, essentially around the world and then through Latin America, to arrive in Arizona. He told officials he left Afghanistan in 2015 and then traveled from Dubai to Brazil. From there, he moved up through Peru and other South American countries before traveling through Central America. In August 2015, he was apprehended in Panama but was released when \u201cno derogatory information\u201d on him was found. He continued his journey, crossing into the U.S. in November before being detected, along with his group, by Border Patrol. The apprehensions were reported at the time. However, the local reports, based on comments from border officials, also said no \u201cderogatory information\u201d turned up when their names were run through security databases. \u201cThe American people would have had no clue on this if we didn\u2019t get these documents from Homeland Security,\u201d Hunter said Friday. Reached for comment, a DHS spokesperson said:\u200e \"Department of Homeland Security agencies and our partners are consistently targeting, through a sustained and unified effort, human smuggling networks. However, as a matter of policy, we do not confirm details in ongoing criminal investigations or law enforcement operations.\u200e\" FoxNews.com's Jennifer Hickey contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Strategy Room: Ellen Ratner and Scott Rasmussen discuss whether Trump can lure the labor vote away from Democrats in 2016 A seemingly growing rift between union members and other factions of the Democratic Party could present an opening this year for Donald Trump \u2013 the NAFTA-hating, border wall-building Republican populist \u2013 to peel off labor voters traditionally loyal to the other side. \u201cThere has been this disconnect between private-sector, white workers and the new Democratic coalition,\u201d pollster Scott Rasmussen said, adding that unions are scrambling this year to \u201cstop the hemorrhaging.\u201d The latest evidence of a fraying Democrat-labor alliance came earlier this month, when billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer unveiled For Our Future PAC, a $50 million partnership with the AFL-CIO and public-sector unions designed to mobilize Democratic voters in key battleground states. The announcement exposed a sense of betrayal felt among some trade unionists which could redound to Trump\u2019s benefit. Union presidents, in a letter to AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, charged that the AFL-CIO has \u201cnow officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members\u201d and \u201cmoved away from us and our membership in the interest of headline-grabbing political expediency.\u201d Terry Sullivan, the president of the laborers union LIUNA, voiced his objection to \u201cthe political agenda of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,\u201d according to a letter obtained by The New York Times. The clash follows the Obama administration rejecting the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 a project labor unions backed \u2013 amid environmental and other concerns. The Steyer embrace may mark a tipping point for trade unions who have been gradually migrating to the Republican side, said Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute, who recently wrote about the \u201cGreen/Blue Divide.\u201d \u201cThis is really about how the Democratic Party is choosing to be more about the extreme environmental agenda of wealthy liberals than it is about blue-collar voters,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe AFL-CIO and the public-sector unions are increasingly becoming an almost-monolithic pro-environmentalist movement within the Democratic Party.\u201d Unlike their public-sector union counterparts, members of unions representing steelworkers, coal miners, construction workers and others are more closely aligned with the positions of the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee on immigration, international trade and Obama-era environmental regulations. Malanga noted that in recent elections, private-sector union support has been critical in securing Republican victories. In 2013, Chris Christie earned the endorsement of two dozen blue-collar unions in his New Jersey gubernatorial re-election race. Could this extend to the presidential race? Polling this season already has shown voters on both sides of the aisle willing to support the other party\u2019s nominee if their candidate of choice were to lose the primary. A recent Fox News poll showed 11 percent of Bernie Sanders voters saying they\u2019d pick Trump over Hillary Clinton. Precise data on union voter preferences is not widely available. But during the primary race in West Virginia, the West Virginia Coal Association did formally endorse the billionaire businessman. \u201cDonald Trump has consistently shown that he understands the need to stop the regulatory assault on our industries and recognizes the pain of the workers in that industry,\u201d group President Bill Raney said, adding that he speaks to leaders with coal associations in surrounding states who have similar concerns about the regulatory climate. \u201cWe have had a lot to talk about over the last eight years and about how the people of Appalachia have been sorely affected by the policies of this administration,\u201d Raney said. \u201cPeople in this area are hunting for hope and wanting to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Donald Trump is showing us that light.\u201d The AFL-CIO, for its part, is bracing for a fight. The powerful union is planning an aggressive grassroots campaign designed to reach between 5 and 6 million voters in the hope of courting would-be Trump supporters. In a March address, Trumka acknowledged Trump is tapping into \u201cvery real and very understandable anger of working people,\u201d but warned Trump also once backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (who famously waged several battles against the unions in his state) and has taken other positions he argued run counter to working-class interests. \u201cTrump says he\u2019s with the American working class, but when you look close, it\u2019s just hot air,\u201d Trumka said. Despite her issues in coal country, likely Democratic nominee Clinton enjoys widespread support from other influential unions, most recently getting the backing of United Auto Workers. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told FoxNews.com there is some potential for Trump to court union voters but called it \u201climited.\u201d \u201cIf you look at biggest [service or government] unions, Trump does very poorly because they tend to be very liberal, non-white and largely female. However, the trade unions, is where he can make some inroads,\u201d he said. The Trump campaign did not return requests for comment for this report. Pollster Rasmussen argued the simmering internecine tensions hold potential for Republicans. \u201cThis is part of an ongoing trend. It is not like it didn\u2019t exist between 2016. \u2026 Issues like immigration are a big part of it. It potentially \u2026 gives the Republicans a shot to have an impact in the Midwest,\u201d said on FoxNews.com\u2019s Strategy Room. Bernie Porn, partner and president of the Michigan polling firm EPIC-MRA, pointed to Michigan, for instance, as a state where the labor vote could drift to Trump. Exit polls showed that among voters who think international trade hurts U.S. jobs, most went for Sanders and not Clinton in the Democratic primary. Michigan hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988. Could Trump, who won the state\u2019s primary, pocket their electoral votes in November? Said Porn, \u201cWho knows, it has been a very unpredictable year so far.\u201d",

Go to the San Diego-Tijuana border and highlight the one part of our border where our government built a secure double-fence as mandated by the Secure Fence Act.\u00a0 Illegal crossings, drugs, murders and other crimes have been drastically reduced.\u00a0 He should be joined by U.S. Representative Peter King and former House Armed Services Chairman Duncan Hunter, co-sponsors of the 2006 Secure Fence Act and announce that his wall will be patterned after this legislation that the last two administrations failed to enforce and fund. ? Give a major address on China.\u00a0 Focus on our massive trade deficit with China, as well as China\u2019s \u201ccyber war\u201d against our national security and economic interests. ? Have a robust \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d (GOTV) and data analytics technology platform.\u00a0 Over 90 million eligible voters did not vote in 2012 and this year roughly 40% of Republicans and Democrats say they may look to another candidate or stay home.\u00a0 Independents will be more important than ever.\u00a0 The votes are there for Trump to win, but he must have the best technology platform a GOP nominee has ever had to identify his supporters and get them to vote. ? Choreograph the Republican National Convention so that each night highlights a specific issue that connects with voters Trump must turn out.\u00a0 Have one night focused on the military and veterans.\u00a0 Another could be focused on securing our borders (highlight how terrorists have used our open border policy, etc.).\u00a0 Faith and family night could highlight the need to end common core\u2014something Trump connected with evangelicals on early in the campaign.\u00a0 Jobs and economy night could be on the last night with him accepting the nomination.\u00a0 An underlying theme could also show a side of Trump that most haven\u2019t seen.\u00a0 There are stories of his generosity helping people in need.\u00a0 While it\u2019s not in his character to talk about such things\u2014the American people need to see this side of him. ? Picking the right vice presidential running mate will be crucial.\u00a0 New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Ohio Governor John Kasich would be solid choices and help the ticket big time.\u00a0 Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich would be the most effective at getting Trump\u2019s agenda enacted and his intellect and vision are sorely needed in a dysfunctional government. ? Identify key presidential appointments, including cabinet positions and a pool of qualified jurists he would pick from for the Supreme Court.\u00a0 President Reagan said that \u201cPersonnel is policy.\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately, no President for the last 25 years has been ready with his key appointments when he took office and it routinely takes over 6 months after the Inaugural to get key personnel in place.\u00a0 By doing this, Trump can say the country is a mess and we need a President who is ready to hit the ground running on Day 1.\u00a0 His announcement of Governor Chris Christie to head his \u201ctransition team\u201d is a good step. ? Enter into a \u201cContract with America\u201d patterned after what House Republicans did in 1994.\u00a0 Focus on securing the border, scrapping the Iran deal, protecting the 2nd Amendment, ending common core, rebuilding America\u2019s military and bringing jobs back home. ? Give an address on how he would work with our allies in the Muslim world to defeat radical Islam.\u00a0 His recent foreign policy speech mentioned this, but you didn\u2019t hear much about it on the evening news.\u00a0 Make King Abdullah, of Jordan, a central part of his strategy.\u00a0 Abdullah, a descendant of Mohammad, is pro-West and complained to our Congress last year about our government\u2019s bureaucracy not giving him all he needs to fight radical Islam. ? Focus on the Rust Belt states.\u00a0 Remind voters this used to be the industrial heartland of America.\u00a0 Families here, who traditionally vote Democrat, have suffered real economic hardship thanks to NAFTA and outsourcing of American jobs.\u00a0 The blue-collar billionaire\u2019s message resonates with them.\u00a0 The Teamsters Union, which backed Ronald Reagan in 1980, is taking a hard look at Trump and many members are already on board.\u00a0 The 1.3 million Teamsters and their families could play a big role in Trump expanding the GOP Electoral College map. ?\u00a0 Remind those Republicans who opposed him for the nomination that President Reagan was right when he said, \u201cMy eighty-percent friend is not my twenty-percent enemy,\u201d and that the traditional GOP based coupled with the millions of new voters he\u2019s brought into the Republican Party is a winning combination. Donald Trump has a real chance to win the presidency.\u00a0 He has connected with working class Americans unlike any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan.

            "article_content": "Strategy Room: Jeanne Zaino and Brian Morgenstern discuss whether Trump can unify the Republicans Congress wasn\u2019t doing a lot before Donald Trump all but secured the Republican presidential nomination. And it\u2019s likely that Trump\u2019s fait accompli Tuesday could diminish congressional productivity even further. As lawmakers return to Washington after a week-long respite, Trump is already in a churning battle with House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and rank-and-file Republicans are divided over what to do about the top of the ticket. Moreover, lawmakers will convene in Washington for the first time with Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee. This is likely to spark four phenomena: Some Republican lawmakers who were reluctant to embrace Trump will rush to join the bandwagon. Secondly, some will dash the other direction to dodge Trump and build distance between their campaign and the New York businessman. Third, Democrats will stoke the political embers, painting Trump and Republicans together in the same camp. Fourth, political talk will dominate the Capitol. Reporters will pepper congressional GOPers about why they are or aren\u2019t backing Trump. Will there be a third party candidate? A savior emerging on a white horse? And you can bet someone will at least sprint to the post in some effort to court Ryan again despite his Sherman-esque statement a few weeks ago about not running for president. This is to say nothing of some Republicans who will blast Ryan for not publicly supporting Trump. Trump creates headaches for Ryan and other congressional leaders. The speaker always says he wants a competition of ideas. Well, how about the idea of building a wall along the Mexican border and forcing Mexico to pay for it? How about the idea that Trump wants to kick Muslims out of the country? How about Trump\u2019s position to cut off foreign workers? What about the idea Trump has to strip some native-born Americans of their citizenship? What about Trump\u2019s idea to deploy the military as a kind of domestic police force and come for families of those associated with terrorists? And what about Trump\u2019s idea to not touch Social Security (one of the key drivers of the national debt) yet hack all federal outlays in half in order to balance the budget in less than a decade? These are the reasons why Ryan can\u2019t get behind Trump just yet. On several occasions, Ryan has taken special care to disavow Trump\u2019s remarks related to everything from Muslims to white supremacy. But if Ryan wants the debate to be about ideas and Trump secured the nomination, well, it\u2019s pretty clear which ideas won out. Which idea is easier for the average voter to understand? Trump talking about rounding up Muslims or building walls \u2026 , or Ryan\u2019s preference of wonky, Oxford-style debate on tax inversions? For Republicans, that ship has sailed and perhaps already sinking, some suggest. What is unclear is what Congress may try to tackle in the coming months. Perhaps an even better question is what appetite Congress has to address much of anything in the near-term with Trump apparently on the ballot. The first issue is time. Congress is back for just a few weeks and then heads out for Memorial Day. Back a few more weeks then gone for July 4th. Then, two weeks in session before both the House and Senate depart on a staggering, nearly-eight week furlough for the Republican and Democratic conventions. That\u2019s coupled with the \u201cAugust\u201d recess that bleeds into September. Then there\u2019s another respite in October so lawmakers can campaign at home. And don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s a campaign afoot among some congressional conservatives to ban a lame-duck session. They argue that Congress accomplishes little that isn\u2019t politically-charged in a lame-duck session (hence the reason some tough issues are delayed until after the election). Therefore, Congress should wrap business before the election and only let the new Congress and the new president grapple with thorny topics next year. For starters, there are the annual spending bills to fund the government. The Senate was trying last week to move through its first appropriations bill of the cycle, dealing with $37.5 million for energy and water programs. But senators got locked up on an issue about the Obama administration dealing in \u201cheavy water\u201d with Tehran as part of the Iran agreement. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ariz., engineered an amendment to prohibit the United States from buying heavy water, used in nuclear reactors, from Iran in the future. Democrats stalled Cotton\u2019s amendment and the entire bill. And so the Senate\u2019s first appropriations bill of the year lies in limbo. Come mid-month, the House will begin floor work on the 12 appropriations bills. Various sources tell Fox News the House should be able to knock out spending packages covering military construction, the legislative branch, energy and water programs, transportation issues, defense, financial services and perhaps one or two others. But floor time is at a maximum. And that\u2019s to say nothing of stray issues that could arise in even the \u201ceasy\u201d appropriations bills. Take the legislative branch measure that funds Congress. Conservatives are livid that the Library of Congress altered its search engines to strike \u201cpejorative\u201d terms such as \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d and \u201cillegal alien.\u201d Instead, Republicans want to return the old verbiage to the search engines. And it\u2019s unknown if the issue could become so nettlesome that it trips up possible Senate confirmation of Carla Hayden to become the Librarian of Congress. If confirmed, Hayden would become the first African American and first woman run the library. Yes, time is a problem for Congress. But time is only an issue because of politics. Congressional leaders control the calendar. There was a conscious decision by leaders to craft such a truncated schedule this year to accommodate both political conventions in July. One might argue that Congress could always just return to session in August if necessary to address major issues. But there isn\u2019t a lot of political will now to do much of anything. On the right, Republicans are just waiting out the Obama presidency -- and hoping for the best come November. Some Republicans are not-so-secretly hoping for an indictment of Hillary Clinton regarding her use of private emails for official business while secretary of state. But some of even the most-partisan Republicans are not terribly excited about the prospects of Trump. That\u2019s why many are already waiting for 2020. You think Congress isn\u2019t doing a lot now? Wait for that four-year, congressional cryogenic freeze. Yes, Republicans may be waiting out the Obama presidency. But many GOPers are afraid to move legislatively because Trump devoured the Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d apparatus alive. With Trump, there\u2019s no normal on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers now must make their legislative and political decisions based on an entirely new calculus. Nobody completely understands the broad dimension of the Trump Effect in the halls of Congress. Of course, some Republicans could opt for a completely different approach. Work like dogs all summer to distract from Trump. Show that Congress is effective -- even in a bipartisan way. Find a worthy negotiating partner in a lame-duck president. This builds natural distance from Trump -- if that\u2019s what Republicans want. The question is appetite. And in this political environment, no one knows what dish is most appealing to the palette.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee addresses the DNC PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton, declaring that the country faces a \u201cmoment of reckoning,\u201d sealed her status in American history Thursday night as the first woman to top a major-party ticket, officially taking the torch from President Obama as the Democratic nominee for president. The former first lady, senator and Secretary of State delivered a blistering attack against Republican nominee Donald Trump, challenging his fitness to occupy the Oval Office and setting the tone for what promises to be a bruising three-month campaign. \u201cThe choice is clear,\u201d Clinton told delegates in Philadelphia in a 56-minute, optimistic speech that stood in contrast to Trump's convention speech in which the mogul pounded away at headwinds facing the nation and drove home the urgent need for change. \"He's taken the Republican Party a long way, from 'Morning in America' to 'Midnight in America,'\" Clinton said, following a warm introduction in which her daughter, Chelsea, painted a personal picture of Hillary the mother and grandmother. \"He wants to divide us - from the rest of the world, and from each other. \u201cHe\u2019s betting that the perils of today\u2019s world will blind us to its unlimited promise,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: \u2018The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u2019\u201d The speech was interrupted many times by noisy protests from supporters of former rival Bernie Sanders, which were soon drowned out by Clinton loyalists chanting, \u201cHillary!\u201d Clinton, 68, sought to win over the Sanders backers, as well as disaffected Republicans and independents, vowing to fight for working people. \u201cI will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful \u2026 for all Americans together,\u201d she said. Clinton laid out a largely liberal agenda that at times echoed themes from Sanders\u2019 campaign that have weaved their way into the party platform, on issues ranging from taxes to the minimum wage to immigration to health care. Trump struck back before the night was over, releasing a statement that accused Democrats of creating a \u201cfantasy world\u201d at their convention and spreading a false message that \u201ceverything is wonderful.\u201d \u201cAt Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention this week, Democrats have been speaking about a world that doesn\u2019t exist,\" the statement read. \"A world where America has full employment, where there\u2019s no such thing as radical Islamic terrorism, where the border is totally secured, and where thousands of innocent Americans have not suffered from rising crime in cities like Baltimore and Chicago.\u201d Trump, who surged ahead of Clinton in most polls following his own party's convention last week, spoke at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and panned the DNC convention before it wrapped up. \"I think we'll stay here all night because I don't really want to go home and watch that crap,\" he said. And he bashed Clinton's address on Twitter: The deeply personal attacks capped by last night's back-and-forth portend a potentially bitter run-up to the November election. Trump has taken to calling Clinton \"Crooked Hillary,\" while Clinton and other Democrats have maligned Trump as a loose cannon who lacks the temperament to be president. \u201cHe loses his cool at the slightest provocation,\u201d Clinton said in her speech. \u201cImagine, if you dare, imagine \u2026 him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 closing convention night included a sharper security focus than earlier in the week. Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, who led troops in Afghanistan, vouched Thursday for Clinton as the candidate who can keep the country \u201csafe and free.\u201d \u201cAmerica will defeat ISIS,\u201d he vowed, naming the terror enemy that seemingly was glossed over by earlier convention speakers. As he spoke, competing chants of \u201cUSA\u201d and \u201cNo More War\u201d broke out in the audience. The final night capped a dramatic week in Philadelphia that started with the abrupt resignation of party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz amid yet another email scandal and ended with an all-hands-on-deck push for unity meant to ease unrest among Sanders supporters and others who spent the convention railing against the Democratic establishment. Even on the final day, protesters organized events to encourage voters to de-register from the party. And as delegates streamed past the perimeter for the speeches, a contingent of anti-Clinton protesters shouted at the gates, \u201cHell no, DNC, we won\u2019t vote for Hillary!\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus ripped Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech Thursday as \"merely a litany of platitudes\" that glossed over critical issues facing the country. \"Time and again, Hillary Clinton\u2019s dishonesty and cronyism have proved she is the wrong person to lead our country as president,\" Priebus said in a statement. \"The American people have had enough of the corruption, the deceit, and the stonewalling which have been the hallmarks of her entire career.\"",

            "article_content": "FILE - April 28, 2016: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Costa Mesa, Calif. (AP) Donald Trump shocked pundits (and many political experts) Wednesday by winning the presidency. But his followers weren\u2019t shocked at all. They understood from the start the power of Trump\u2019s message, and the anger of middle class Americans. Americans suffering from stagnant wages and lost jobs, who were the last to benefit from the liberal agenda of Barack Obama. Americans fed up with the self-serving Washington political establishment, the crony capitalism and the insufferable political correctness stifling our workplaces and our universities. Americans tired of the intellectual elites who look down on flag waving and old-fashioned patriotism and consider themselves morally superior. Deplorables to Clinton: take that! A clear majority wanted to set the country on a new direction, and Donald Trump promised to do just that. He promised to Make America Great Again, and they believed him. Even as the returns flowed in, the results appeared to shock the mainstream media commentators reporting on the vote. They didn\u2019t expect blue collar workers in Ohio to flow to Trump; they couldn\u2019t believe that union voters, such predictable backers of Democrats historically, would line up in the red column. Where have these people been? This has been the bedrock of Trump\u2019s support. People didn\u2019t flood those huge Trump rallies because of rock stars like Jay Z or Lady Gaga; they turned out because Trump was saying what they longed to hear. They cheered when Trump said he would revamp our trade policies to protect U.S. workers. They liked that he promised to close our borders and reestablish the rule of law. They especially applauded his pledge to take on the corrupt elites in Washington and to push for term limits. The pundits expected Hispanics to hand several swing states to Clinton; while turnout was only modestly higher with the Latino community, Trump appears to have done about as well as Romney did with that community. That was unexpected. Maybe next time Democrats should try to speak to the whole country, and stop slicing and dicing the electorate. Stronger together indeed! Here\u2019s what else happened in the 2016 election: voters decided to put the Clintons and their greedy corruption out to pasture. Clinton had everything going for her: a compliant media, a popular president in her corner, over a billion dollars in campaign fund and a well-organized party apparatus. At the end, none of it mattered. Clinton had no message and no vision. She wandered as a candidate, portraying herself alternately as a benevolent grandma, a firebrand progressive and a champion of women and children. In the closing weeks of the campaign she was the angry, shrill prude offended by Donald Trump\u2019s lewd remarks about women, while at the same time lauding Jay Z\u2019s foul lyrics. There is noting genuine about Mrs. Clinton. She is a hypocrite and she is dishonest, and the voters know it. Clinton apologists will blame FBI Director James Comey for the loss, they will blame Vladimir Putin; they will say she lost because she is a woman. None of it is true. Hillary was a terrible candidate. There will be enormous handwringing in both parties over the incredible success of Donald Trump. Pundits will dredge up any number of abstruse rationales for how Trump overcame long odds and humiliated both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. It\u2019s not that complicated. Average Americans, the men and women who work hard and play by the rules, decided to make their voices heard. Now comes the hard part. Trump will have to flesh out a thoroughly undernourished organization and quickly find the people who can carry out his agenda. The media will be gunning for him; impatient voters who took a chance on an untested leader may not have much patience. Trump promised to quickly convene a special session of Congress and demand that they repeal and remodel ObamaCare. It is a brilliant idea. Imagine how excited the country would be to see actual progress. Maybe this will be the next shocker; Donald Trump might turn out to be a good president.",

            "article_content": "Fox News media analyst explains Donald Trump had his strongest debate performance here in Las Vegas, and Hillary Clinton had to deal with probing questions about Wikileaks disclosures, late-term abortion and open borders. In the end they were evenly matched, an outcome that favors Trump as the less experienced debater. But the 90 minutes moderated by Chris Wallace did little to change the dynamic of a race in which the Republican nominee is trailing. Instead, in an unusually substantive and largely civil encounter, the candidates played to their respective bases on such issues as immigration and abortion. So while Trump supporters have reason to cheer their man, who was far more sure-footed than in their first faceoff on Long Island, he did not shake up the race. But Trump may have undone whatever progress he made with a single answer, refusing to say he would accept the results of an election he has increasingly described as rigged. \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe media is so dishonest and so corrupt\u201d that it has \u201cpoisoned the minds of voters.\u201d Clinton called that answer \u201chorrifying\u201d and said Trump often blames a loss on a rigged system, even when his \u201cApprentice\u201d show didn\u2019t win an Emmy three years in a row. That will undoubtedly be the big headline coming out of the debate and will dog Trump between now and Election Day. Trump\u2019s shakiest moment came when he was asked about the allegations of sexual misconduct by nine women. He said their stories were \u201clargely debunked,\u201d that they want their \u201c10 minutes of fame\u201d and said, without evidence, that he believed the Clinton campaign was behind it. Clinton countered by saying Trump had denied the allegations by suggesting the women weren\u2019t attractive, adding: \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\u201d The Democratic nominee stumbled when asked about conflicts at the Clinton Foundation. When Clinton responded by praising the charity\u2019s work, Wallace cut her off and tossed the question of Trump, who called it a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d After two weeks of immersion in allegations of bias, misbehavior and a rigged election, the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor brought the focus back to serious issues\u2014and was tough on both contenders. Some of the sharpest exchanges took place on immigration. Trump made his usual push for strong borders against \u201cbad hombres\u201d; Clinton said massive deportations would \u201crip our country apart\u201d and accused her opponent of having \u201cchoked\u201d by not bringing up his proposed wall during his meeting with Mexico\u2019s president. She also accused him of bashing immigrants. When Wallace asked Clinton about a Wikileaks disclosure that she had favored \u201copen borders\u201d in a six-figure speech to a big bank, she deflected the question and blamed Russian espionage for trying to influence the election. \u201cThat was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders,\u201d Trump said. She shot back by saying that Vladimir Putin wanted a \u201cpuppet\u201d as president, prompting Trump to say they had never met and were hardly best friends. An opening question on the Supreme Court produced a study in contrasts: Clinton talked about the court defending women\u2019s, gay and abortion rights. Trump hit Ruth Bader Ginsburg and said the Second Amendment is under siege. Prodded repeatedly by Wallace, Trump would not say he wanted the high court to overturn Roe v. Wade but said that would be the outcome since he will appoint pro-life justices. Clinton, of course, said she strongly supports the decision, noted Trump\u2019s criticism of Planned Parenthood and recalled his walked-back remark about punishing women who had abortions if the procedure is outlawed. Pressed by Wallace on why she voted against banning partial-birth abortion, Clinton said the government should not step in in making that \u201cmost personal of decisions.\u201d Trump spoke of the gruesome nature of the procedure. Wallace, who fought to enforce time limits, was also tough on Trump, saying that when it came to his financial plans, \u201ceven conservative economics\u201d say \u201cthe numbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t address that point but attacked NAFTA, pushed through by Bill Clinton, and accused his opponent of flip-flopping on the Pacific trade deal. \u201cThere\u2019s only one candidate on this stage who has shipped jobs to Mexico,\u201d she countered. It is harder for a trailing candidate to shake up the race in a third debate, as impressions harden after the first two. Trump, who owns a major casino in this city, did not win enough chips to change the betting odds. And he continued to question whether the house rules are fair.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump weighs in on the UK leaving the European Union Britain\u2019s stunning vote to leave the European Union sent shockwaves across the American political landscape Friday, with Donald Trump cheering the decision to \u201ctake their country back\u201d and linking the campaign to his own populist bid \u2013 as U.S. officials tried to offer assurances the U.S.-U.K. alliance will endure the global turmoil wrought by the vote. \"The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,\" President Obama, who had fought for Britain to stay in the union, said in a written statement. \"... The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship.\" Trump, meanwhile, happened to be in Scotland touring his golf resorts as the verdict came in. As Hillary Clinton claimed the vote underscores the need for tested leadership, Trump said it just goes to show how \"angry\" voters on both sides of the Atlantic are with the status quo. Trump even put the result at Obama\u2019s feet and criticized him for meddling: \u201cHe shouldn't have done it, and I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail.\u201d The presumptive Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy press conference touting what he described as the \u201cbig parallel\u201d between the sentiments driving Britain\u2019s \u201cLeave\u201d campaign and those driving his own presidential bid. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have this more and more \u2026 and I think it\u2019s happening in the United States,\u201d Trump said. He pointed foremost to anger over high immigration levels. \"They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over, nobody even knows who they are,\" Trump said. In a written statement, Trump underscored the parallels further, saying U.K. residents \u201cdeclared their independence\u201d from the E.U., and: \u201cCome November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first.\u201d Presumptive Democratic nominee Clinton, hours later, put out a statement echoing Obama and others in saying the U.S. respects the choice of U.K. voters. As the Dow began to tumble, she said, \"Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\" Clinton also suggested the vote should strengthen her appeal in the U.S., saying the uncertainty \"only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.\" Trump had backed the push to leave the E.U., but Obama and others in Washington openly joined British Prime Minister David Cameron \u2013 who now plans to resign \u2013 in opposing it. Their voices were snubbed at the polls Thursday, despite warnings about what leaving the European Union might mean for trade, the financial markets and other areas. The markets indeed were heaving Friday in the wake of the vote. Vice President Biden, in Ireland, acknowledged the administration had looked for \u201ca different outcome,\u201d but stressed that the U.S. has a \u201clongstanding friendship with the U.K.\u201d and will respect the vote. He said that bond \u201cruns deep and will endure.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan had a similar message. \u201cI respect the decision made by the people of the United Kingdom. The U.K. is an indispensable ally of the United States, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote,\u201d he said in a statement. Still, the outcome in Britain potentially sets up a domino effect of similar votes across Europe \u2013 testing the cohesion of the Western alliance \u2013 while throwing into question Britain\u2019s future trade relationship not only with E.U. countries but the United States. Obama, in urging against Britain leaving the union, warned in April that Britain would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d in terms of striking a trade deal with the U.S. if it leaves. Trump said Friday he was surprised by that comment and vowed if he\u2019s president, \u201cThey\u2019ll always be at the front of the line.\u201d But Trump did agree that other countries would look to break off from the European Union. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s on its way,\u201d Trump said. Trump's reason for his trip to Europe wasn't politics, but rather to check on a pair of championship-level golf resorts he owns in Scotland. Trump, who unlike previous presidential candidates did not schedule any political meetings while abroad, spent Friday morning marking the $200 million-plus rehabilitation of the famed Turnberry golf resort nestled on the rocky coast facing the North Atlantic Ocean.

            "article_content": "SIERRA VISTA, AZ - OCTOBER 30:  The new MQ-9 Predator B, an unmanned surveillance aircraft system, unveiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), takes off at Libby Army Airfield at Ft. Huachuca October 30, 2006 in Sierra Vista, Arizona. CBP will use the new MQ-9 Predator aircraft to patrol the southern border of the United Sates in order to stop the illegal entry of thousands of Mexican nationals and drug runners who use the vast expanses of the Sonoran desert to cross into southern Arizona, daily. The new unarmed plane flew briefly for the press to show off its surveillance  capabilities by pilots of the contractor, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. Agents of CBP will start training on the use of the aircraft very soon. The Predator will start full scale flight operations along the Mexico-Arizona border today.  (Photo by Gary Williams/Getty Images) ((Photo by Gary Williams/Getty Images)) For nearly a decade, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has touted its drone program as an \u201ceffective technology to further enhance operational capabilities,\u201d but according to the agency\u2019s 2014 end of fiscal year report, the results are anything but impressive, fueling new calls for the program to be grounded. The program has a fleet of 9 Predator drones and the Department of Homeland Security is planning to spend another $443 million for more aircraft to help secure the Mexican border. But a Jan. 6 report from the agency's inspector general is advising against the expansion. \u201cNotwithstanding the significant investment, we see no evidence that the drones contribute to a more secure border, and there is no reason to invest additional taxpayer funds at this time,\u201d said DHS Inspector General John Roth. \u201cSecuring our borders is a crucial mission for CBP and DHS. CBP\u2019s drone program has so far fallen far short of being an asset to that effort.\u201d The IG report, the second audit of the program since 2012, found there is no reliable method of measuring the program's performance and determined that its impact in stemming illegal immigration has been minimal. According to the CBP Fiscal Year Report, the drones flew about 10 percent fewer hours in 2014 than the previous year and 20 percent fewer than in 2013. The missions were credited with contributing to the seizure of just under 1,000 pounds of cocaine in 2014, compared to 2,645 in 2013 and 3,900 in 2012. But apprehensions of illegal immigrants between 2014 and 2013 fell despite the flood of more than 60,000 unaccompanied children coming across the border from Central America. Combined with the decrease in productivity, the OIG report disclosed the staggering costs to run the program, more than $12,000 per hour when figuring fuel, salaries for operators, equipment and overhead. Eugene Schied, assistant commissioner of the CBP's office of administration for CBP, said the IG used flawed methods to draw its conclusions. \u201cThe expectations the OIG focused on were based on the program receiving resources that were not obtained, performance measures that were never employed by CBP, or technological capabilities that have been surpassed,\u201d Scheid said. \u201cThis context is critical for presenting an accurate assessment of the CBP UAS program\u2019s current performance and achievements.\u201d Scheid went on to say in his memo that CBP has no plans to acquire additional UAS beyond the one replacement aircraft, nor does the Office of Air and Marine have a contract or funding in place to expand the program. He said current funding is being used to expand the program\u2019s infrastructure and increase the utilization of the fleet. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) called for patience with the UAS program. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot cheaper to use drones than helicopters and they can stay in the air longer,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt still comes down to having the manpower on the ground to support the drone missions.\u201d Hunter said CBP needs to figure out what the need and use of the UAS is but marry that strategy with human resources on the ground. He made the correlation to the limitations other forms of border security technology such as sensors has in that unless there are agents who can respond quickly to the location, they do little good. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not sure CBP has the manpower to support the drone missions,\u201d Hunter said. What he did express concern over, also given the rise in unaccompanied children crossing the border this year was that, \u201cCBP isn\u2019t doing themselves any favor by flying less hours.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon compares the 2016 rhetoric to past campaigns Donald Trump\u2019s campaign confirmed that the candidate is off the campaign trail Sunday to get ready for his first presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton but was mum on preparation strategy or likely tactics. \u201cHe's the unpredictable X factor,\u201d campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about Trump and his unconventional debate style. To be sure, Trump, despite being a first-time candidate, performed well enough in the primary debates -- which included seasoned debaters like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- to capture the GOP nomination. However, whether his aggressive style can prevail against Clinton, a seasoned politician, remains to be seen. \u201cHe's an unconventional candidate,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd he's not going to prepare the way Hillary does, which is . . . locking her in a room and cramming her head with all those binders and getting the Hollywood types that she raised gazillions of dollars with in fundraisers.\u201d Famed New York lawyer Alan Dershowitz recently told Politico that he would like, if asked, to play the role of Trump in mock debates, amid reports the Clinton campaign is looking at several potential stand-ins. \u201cShe feels like it is a proving ground, that this is a job interview,\u201d campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told The Washington Post. \u201cI think she will approach the debate with a great deal of seriousness and a sense of purpose, and also keenly aware that Donald Trump is capable of anything.\u201d Trump and Clinton will have three debates: Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Long Island, N.Y.; Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis and Oct. 19 at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas The debates also could have a second X factor: Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson is trying to get on stage with them. The former Republican New Mexico governor needs 15 percent of the vote to qualify and now has 8 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. \u201cWe're optimistic that we're going to actually get into the debates,\u201d Johnson told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe're spending money right now in many states. In five states right now, I'm at 16 percent. So I'm just really optimistic.\u201d Conway confirmed a debate-related meeting Sunday at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, in New Jersey, but was coy about whether Trump will hold mock debates. \u201cHe might,\u201d she said. Conway also declined to say if conservative Laura Ingraham will play the role of Clinton. \u201cLaura's a friend of all of ours, and we appreciate any insight and advice that she is willing to give in her very busy life,\u201d Conway continued. \u201cDonald Trump, who's been taking his case directly to the voters, is the one that you will see on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And I think they're nervous over in Clinton camp.\u201d",

            "article_content": "New poll finds voters feel that Trump would better handle ISIS, but favor Clinton in an international crisis. Voters also believe Clinton is better prepared to be president, but that Trump is a better leader. Karl Rove goes 'On the Record' to examine Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are making big campaign promises as they prepare for a likely November election face-off \u2013 but a new poll shows voters have little faith either candidate can deliver if elected president. The Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed that on Trump\u2019s marquee campaign promise \u2013 to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2013 just 24 percent of voters believe the presumptive Republican nominee would be able to construct it and have Mexico foot the bill. As for Clinton\u2019s call to limit secret money in politics or restrict the influence of Wall Street, voters are similarly skeptical. Just 9 percent said she\u2019d be able to remove \u2018secret\u2019 campaign cash from the political system; 63 percent predicted the Democratic presidential front-runner, if elected, wouldn\u2019t even try. Likewise, only 15 percent said Clinton would be able to curb the power of Wall Street; 56 percent said she would not bother to try. Twenty-one percent said she\u2019d try and fail. \u201cNo matter which candidate you pick, you can cut the cynicism with a knife,\u201d Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement. Voters had a bit more faith that Trump would try to achieve his campaign promises, even if they doubt he\u2019ll succeed. On the border wall, 39 percent said he\u2019d try and fail, while 29 percent said he wouldn\u2019t actually try. And on his call to deport millions of illegal immigrants, 19 percent of voters said he would be able to do it. Forty-five percent said he\u2019d try and fail, and 29 percent said he wouldn\u2019t try. The poll of 1,561 registered voters was taken May 24-30. It had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Insight from Carol Lee, White House correspondent for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON \u2013 Hillary Clinton's campaign asked former President Bill Clinton to cancel a speech to a Wall Street investment firm last year because of concerns that the Clintons might appear to be too cozy with Wall Street just as the former secretary of state was about to announce her White House bid, newly released emails show. Clinton aides say in hacked emails released Friday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton did not want her husband to cancel the speech, but after a \"cool down period\" was eventually convinced that canceling was the right step. Campaign manager Robby Mook said he realized canceling the lucrative speech would disappoint both Clintons but \"it's a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months.\" The Clintons' paid speeches have been an issue throughout the campaign, particularly Hillary Clinton's private speeches to Wall Street firms. Hillary Clinton earned about $1.5 million in speaking fees before launching her presidential campaign, while Bill Clinton reaped more than $5 million from banking, tech and other corporate interests, according to financial documents filed by Hillary Clinton. The campaign has never released transcripts of Hillary Clinton's speeches, but the hacked emails did reveal excerpts flagged by her advisers as potentially concerning. In the excerpts, Clinton talked about dreaming of \"open trade and open borders\" in the Western Hemisphere. She also says politicians sometimes need to have \"both a public and a private position\" on issues. Bill Clinton was scheduled to speak to Morgan Stanley executives in April 2015, a few days after his wife was set to launch her bid for president. \"That's begging for a bad rollout,\" Mook wrote in a March 11, 2015, email. In a later email, Mook says he feels \"very strongly that doing the speech is a mistake\" with serious potential consequences for Hillary Clinton's campaign. \"People would (rightfully) ask how we let it happen.\" Hillary Clinton was scheduled to campaign in Iowa, \"where caucus goers have a sharply more negative view of Wall Street than the rest of the electorate,\" Mook wrote. \"Wall Street ranks first for Iowans among a list of institutions that 'take advantage of every day Americans,' scoring twice as high as the general election electorate. ... This is a very big deal in my view.\" Clinton's longtime aide, Huma Abedin, assured Mook the next day that Clinton was fine with canceling the speech, especially if Bill Clinton agreed. The candidate \"just needed a cool down period,\" Abedin wrote. The emails were among thousands published this week by WikiLeaks, which has been releasing a series of emails hacked from the accounts of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. U.S. intelligence officials last week blamed the Russian government for a series of breaches intended to influence the presidential election. The Russians deny involvement. Podesta's hacked messages offer insight into the various strategies and responses considered by those close to Clinton as they grappled with pitfalls in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, including the 2009 decision to use a private email server while serving as secretary of state. In a separate email, Clinton aides discussed how to explain her 2001 support for an overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy system. Sanders was citing past criticism by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as evidence of Clinton's favoritism to Wall Street. Clinton defended the vote in a TV interview earlier this year, saying she pursued language to ensure women received child support if a spouse went into bankruptcy. In a Feb. 7 email, adviser Ann O'Leary noted that Clinton had overstated her case: \"She said women groups were all pressuring her to vote for it. Evidence does not support that statement.\" Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said Friday that the campaign has taken unspecified precautions to secure its emails. Asked whether officials were considering releasing all of Podesta's emails at once, Palmieri said, \"That is what the Russians would like us to do and we are not going to do that.\" Emails released Friday also show that Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, used a second alias to communicate with her mother's campaign: Anna James. Chelsea Clinton also used the alias Diane Reynolds, according to emails previously made public.",

            "article_content": "Plotting out Donald's map to victory Donald Trump's campaign said a computer error resulted in a prominent white nationalist being mistakenly included on a list of his potential California delegates, an embarrassment for a candidate who has been criticized before for being too slow to distance himself from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The campaign said in a statement Tuesday that the name has been withdrawn and a corrected list resubmitted to state officials. Trump California director Tim Clark released a statement blaming a \"database error\" for the inclusion of William Johnson, which said he been rejected and removed from the campaign's list in February 2016. Johnson, a white nationalist leader and Trump supporter, told The Associated Press that he received an email from Clark earlier Tuesday informing him that his name had been \"erroneously listed\" as a delegate. Johnson runs the American National Super PAC, which made automated phone calls supporting Trump's candidacy across the country. The Los Angeles attorney told the AP it had been a mistake for him to submit his name for consideration. In California, Republican candidates pick potential delegates to the GOP's summer convention. They are selected based on the outcome of voting in the state's June 7 primary. \"I was naive,\" Johnson said. \"I thought people wouldn't notice, and if they did notice I didn't think it would be a big deal.\" He added that he is resigning from his role as delegate, effective immediately. Johnson's appearance on the list was first reported by Mother Jones magazine. Previously, Trump has drawn criticism for hesitating before denouncing former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who said not voting for Trump was \"treason to your heritage.\" Johnson said he never disclosed his white nationalist beliefs in his application. \"You answer the questions that they ask, and they asked, `What have you done to support Donald Trump?' They didn't ask, `Are you a white nationalist?\" he said. Trump \"wants to build the wall (along the border with Mexico). He wants to cut off illegal immigration, and he wants to cut back on foreign trade, bring jobs back to America,\" Johnson added. \"We believe Donald Trump will help lead the country in a proper direction.\" Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the California Secretary of State's Office, said the Trump campaign attempted to submit a revised list of delegates to the office Tuesday, a day after the deadline. It was rejected. However, Mahood said state election law allows candidates to submit a list of alternates within 30 days after the June 7 primary. He said it would be up to the Republican National Committee or the state Republican Party to set the process for replacing a delegate with an alternate.",

(U.S. Customs and Border Patrol) The Land Rover Defender is one of the toughest vehicles ever built yet even it can\u2019t survive the crusher of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The example featured in the above video was seized at a Baltimore port back in April and sent to the crusher because it was imported illegally. The Defender is no longer offered for sale in the U.S. due to crash safety and emissions regulations, but older versions, at least 25 years of age, can be imported legally under classic car rules. Since the basic design of the Defender hasn\u2019t changed since the launch of the first version back in 1983, unscrupulous individuals have been buying more recent examples on the used market in the U.K. and modifying them to look like older series models. The vehicles are then imported to the U.S. under the classic car rules and sold to possibly unwary customers. Even the VINs are swapped for those from older models. Due to its rarity, prices for a Defender in the U.S. can reach as much as $100,000, according to Robert Hunt, a customs officer in Baltimore. In the U.K., used examples can be found for as little as $2,000. Original Mini Coopers have also been illegally imported using the same means. Hopefully Land Rover will hurry up and launch a new Defender in the U.S. since clearly there is considerable demand for the iconic nameplate. The last we heard, the new Defender\u2019s launch has been pushed back beyond 2015, the date when the current model will be phased out due to tougher emissions regulations.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during the third presidential debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman) The third and final presidential debate highlighted Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for partial-birth abortion, \u201copen borders\u201d (her words), and \u201cfree\u201d college for all students whose families make up to $125,000. Yet Donald Trump is the extremist, in the eyes of the elite media, because he wouldn\u2019t pledge to support the outcome of the election in advance. Such pledges, of course, are useless. In response to another Fox News debate question, Jeb Bush pledged in advance to support the Republican nominee, no matter who he or she was. Yet Bush is now opposing Trump. Moreover, it is hardly unprecedented for a candidate not to accept the election\u2019s outcome. Al Gore fought for weeks to try to wrestle the 2000 election away from George W. Bush, who was declared the winner on election night. Gore didn\u2019t concede the race until the Supreme Court ruled against him. This very month, almost 16 years later, Gore was still implying that he won, with Hillary Clinton sitting behind him and nodding approvingly as he spoke: \u201cHere\u2019s my point: I don\u2019t want you to be in a position years from now where you welcome Hillary Clinton and say, \u2018Actually, you did win. It just wasn\u2019t close enough to make sure that all the votes were counted or whatever.'\u201d So-called media elites are conveniently overlooking such matters. Even more significantly, however, they seem blissfully ignorant of the fact that the peaceful transition of power under the Constitution relies on the sitting president accepting the outcome of the election \u2014 and leaving office. Who cares if Donald Trump is declared the loser and thinks he won? He would be powerless to do much of anything about it, as was Gore. It\u2019s not like Trump could call in the Air Force, or the Army. It is the current president, the commander-in-chief, who is in a position to jeopardize the peaceful transition of power \u2014 not the losing candidate. Shockingly, media elites don\u2019t seem to understand this matter of basic civics. Nor do they seem to realize that our presidential election results haven't always been fair or worthy of unconditional acceptance, particularly in advance. In 1876 (the year that baseball's National League was formed), Samuel J. Tilden, a reformer and a Democrat, won the popular vote by the handy margin of 3 full percentage points (50.9 percent to 47.9 percent) over Republican Rutherford B. Hayes \u2014 larger than the margins of victory for Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon (in 1968), or John F. Kennedy, and nearly as large as Barack Obama's 3.9-point win in 2012 \u2014 and seemingly won the electoral vote. Yet he was denied the presidency. Here's how the wonderful Webster's Guide to American History (1971) recounts our centennial election: \"Nov. 7 [1876]. Tilden receives 4,284,000 popular votes to Hayes's 4,036,000 [Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections updates that to 4,286,808 for Tilden and 4,034,142 for Hayes]; electoral vote is Tilden 184, to Hayes 163, but Republicans do not concede votes won by Tilden in Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon, without which he is one vote short of a majority [in the electoral vote]\u2026. \"Dec. 6. Four states in question each proffer two sets of electoral votes, the Southern states having disqualified enough Tilden votes to elect Hayes, and Democratic Oregon governor having illegally replaced one Republican elector with a Democrat. Since Constitution does not specify whether Senate (Republican-dominated) or House (Democratic) counts votes, and there are two sets for the four states, election results will depend on arm of Congress counting vote\u2026. \"Jan. 29. To break Tilden-Hayes electoral vote deadlock, Congress sets up 15-member Electoral Commission: three Democrats and two Republicans from the House, three Republicans and two Democrats from the Senate, and two each Democratic and Republican members of the Supreme Court, with an additional justice who is independent, Justice David Davis. Davis, however, has been elected to the Senate and is replaced be Republican Joseph P. Bradley\u2026. \"Feb. 9. Bradley, who has favored Tilden, is persuaded to change to Hayes, and commission votes 8 (Republicans) to 7 (Democrats) not to investigate disputed votes. Hayes is given Florida vote\u2026. \"Feb. 16-23. Three remaining states' votes are also given to Hayes. Republicans have won Southern Democratic support for commission's findings by consenting to three Southern demands: to appropriate large sums for Southern improvement, to appoint one Southerner to the Cabinet, and to withdraw federal troops from Southern states\u2026. \"March 3. President Hayes, declared elected [with 185 electoral votes to Tilden's 184] on previous day, takes oath of office\u2026.\" Tilden later said, \"I can retire to private life with the consciousness that I shall receive from posterity the credit of having been elected to the highest position in the gift of the people, without any of the cares and responsibilities of the office.\" With such precedent in mind, and with the Democratic Party now openly opposed to such basic notions as requiring identification for voters, maybe Trump is better off not validating the election results in advance. There's nothing at all revolutionary about that.",

            "article_content": "Bias Bash: Syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor Cal Thomas weighs in on the lack of objectivity by reporters when covering Donald Trump compared with Hillary Clinton Anyone supporting Donald Trump is \u201cmorally tainted,\u201d ABC and NPR commentator Cokie Roberts declared Tuesday, while making no mention of possible ethical dilemmas facing backers of Hillary Clinton. Roberts, who has been unabashed in going after the Republican presidential nominee, told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that her Southern upbringing gives her the insight and authority to know Trump\u2019s candidacy was a \u201cstain,\u201d taking the country back in that direction. \u201cThey\u2019re morally tainted,\u201d Roberts said of the 40 percent or so of American voters who polls say support Trump. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s just no question about that. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever seen anything like this,\u201d the 72-year-old continued. \u201cNot only did I grow up in politics, I grew up in the Jim Crow South. And we spent the last 50 years trying to bring people together instead of push people apart. And so that becomes a terrible stain on the country.\u201d No mention was made of Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of a yearlong federal inquiry that led FBI Director James Comey to call her \u201cextremely careless\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d in her handling of sensitive emails, and to say she was not truthful in public claims about her actions. In addition, Clinton is now reportedly the subject of an investigation by multiple U.S. Attorneys looking at ties between her work as Secretary of State and her family\u2019s foundation. Roberts, whose parents were Democratic members of Congress, has made her feelings about Trump clear before. In February, the syndicated newspaper column she writes with her husband, Steve Roberts, called for \u201cthe rational wing\u201d of the Republican Party to stop Trump. \"[Trump] is one of the least qualified candidates ever to make a serious run for the presidency,\" the couple wrote. \"If he is nominated by a major party -- let alone elected -- the reputation of the United States would suffer a devastating blow around the world.\" The column put her in a tough spot with NPR, whose policy forbids journalists from being subjective on political candidates. Roberts followed the column up with a harsh grilling of Trump on MSNBC on March 9, asking him about his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border and charging that the position stoked racism. Trump brings out the boas in journalists like Roberts. (Associated Press) \"Are you proud of that?\u201d Roberts pressed. \u201cIs that something you've done in American political and social discourse that you're proud of?\" Roberts\u2019 bias was so clear that NPR Editorial Director Michael Oreskes wrote in a memo to staffers that news executives would have to redefine her \u00a0job. \"Our journalists have clear instructions,\" Oreskes wrote in his memo, sent to staffers Monday morning. \"We do not support or oppose candidates. We don't advise political parties. We gather the news and seek as many points of view as we can. Cokie's role has evolved into being one of those points of view.\" Roberts has weighed in on Hillary Clinton, telling ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, a former Clinton staffer, that anti-Hillary sentiment was due to sexism. Citing an unnamed poll in the April, 2015 interview, Roberts referenced \"research that shows that a woman who is strong and powerful is seen as not friendly and empathetic.\" \"Here we are in 2015...and we still have to deal with that,\" Roberts lamented. \"[Clinton] is running against herself. She's trying to figure out how to show people how she's a warm and friendly person.\"",

(AP) Buzz Cut: AMNESTY THREAT LOOMS OVER OBAMA LAWSUIT\u00a0No doubt President Obama will be trumpeting today the fact that the economy snapped back from a shrunken second quarter when he delivers a campaign speech today in Kansas City. But the speech, which will also push the president\u2019s proposed plan to outlaw U.S. companies moving their headquarters to tax havens overseas, is likely to really be about the lawsuit against him expected to come from the House of Representatives today. The White House has promised that the president will go \u201chead on\u201d against the lawsuit, which charges that the president\u2019s selective enforcement of ObamaCare has violated the constitutional separation of powers. But what the president is really talking about is impeachment. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel will follow the lawsuit and the possible implications.]Stuntmen and fall guys \u2013 Democrats talk a lot about the impeachment of the president these days. A lot. It raises scads of money and helps frighten voters to the polls. But Republican leaders say even the idea of impeachment is a \u201cscam\u201d being perpetrated by Democrats. Democrats, in turn, deride today\u2019s House lawsuit of being \u201ca stunt\u201d designed to whip up the Republican base and extract donations while simultaneously delaying the inevitable impeachment\u2026 which Democrats use to fundraise. And so, folks, we have now reach the point of politics as an infinite feedback loop \u2013 behold the birth of the self-perpetuating automatic umbrage machine. But aside from who can raise more huffing umbrage gas, there are some very consequential things going on here. [Does the lawsuit have a ghost of a chance? Yes or no, depending on whom you ask.]Back to the border - The backdrop for all of this is the president\u2019s pending plan to take executive action to give amnesty to illegal immigrants. While this lawsuit is something of a Hail Mary pass, it represents an effort to get a legal check on the president ahead of this move. Democrats are grinding hard on impeachment but this is Republicans looking to avoid what would almost certainly be a politically disastrous impeachment move. If Obama were to engage in some mass legalization, public attitudes might change, but for now, both sides are feeling their way through the constitutional wormhole that this administration has opened up. How far can the president go in expanding executive power and how far will Congress go to try to stop him?Ummmm - \u201cThe American people are totally opposed to this, we shouldn\u2019t be off on those tracks of impeachment, suing the president. We should be legislating.\u201d \u2013Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the readily available Senate floor.\u00a0\u00a0 [Watch Fox: Sen.

While they continue to lobby against certain provisions \u2014 especially a hefty tax placed on each insurance policy a company sells \u2014 the individual mandate\u2019s requirement that all Americans purchase coverage rapidly expands their customer base.

Wired explains how World War I\u2019s signature vehicle was instrumental in developing modern cars: \u201cThe Vauxhall D-Type, or \u201825hp,\u2019 which first rolled off the production line in 1915, crossed battlefields on the Western Front (modern Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium), Egypt, and Russian Empire. It had a 4-cylinder 3,969cc engine that could take five passengers to just over 60 mph\u2026. Back in the day when comparing engine power to horse power was really relevant, 25 hp was a big deal. The animals were likely even more excited: About 8 million horses died in the four years of fighting, and it\u2019s safe to assume the 1,500 D-Types produced for the military kept that number from going a bit higher. How the car\u2019s bicycle tires made it over roads that barely earned that name, we\u2019re still flummoxed, but its solid chassis and durable engine proved a winning combination. At the insistence of the British war offices, Vauxhall produced up to seven of these vehicles a week.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The ad opens to a picture of Shane Woods, a soldier who was killed in Iraq in 2006. \u201cI take refuge in how proud my son was to serve. It gives me a deeper appreciation for the price of freedom, and what it means to be an American,\u201d says father Wayne Woods of Palmer, Alaska, who says he volunteered to help the Sullivan campaign by appearing in the spot. Wood says Sullivan, who has been deployed several times with the Marine Corps, is \u201cready to fight for Alaska.\u201d \u201cI know [Sullivan] shares the same values my son had.\u00a0This is a man of the highest personal integrity that will not compromise his principles for political gain.\u201d Sullivan is in a tight GOP primary race against Alaska Lt.

Mark Begich is out with a new ad touting the level of cooperation between him and Alaska's senior senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski pushed back against a similar radio ad from the Democrat, saying that while they agree on many issues specific to Alaska, they differ on a number of national issues. A Murkowski spokesman referred a reporter to comments Murkowski made to the Wall Street Journal, that Begich should run on his own record.\u201dCONSERVATIVE GROUP HITS PRYOR ON OBAMACARE \u2018DECIDING VOTE\u2019\u00a0 Americans for Prosperity, a conservative non-profit group, launched a new ad today featuring Arkansas residents Wanda and Jerry Buckley telling how ObamaCare has hurt their lives. \u201cWe got a letter telling us that our current policy was going to be cancelled,\u201d Jerry says in ad, which the group says is backed by $285,000 ad buy. Wanda said she trusted President Obama when he said she could keep her plan, but that it wasn\u2019t true in this case. \u201cIn this matter, he either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care,\u201d Jerry concludes. \u201cWhen Jerry and Wanda shared their story of how ObamaCare is wreaking havoc in their lives, Sen. Mark Pryor's[, D-Ark.] response was to dismiss them with a wave of his hand,\u201d Tim Phillips, president of AFP, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the problems caused by his vote for ObamaCare are real, and are negatively impacting Arkansans \u2013 young and old- every single day.

Braley's newest TV ad criticizes his Republican rival, Joni Ernst, for saying during a NFIB forum that she thinks a minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is appropriate for Iowa and that she opposes the idea of a federal bill to increase the wage to $10.10 per hour.\u201dDOCTORS BACK ROBERTS AFTER WOLF\u2019S X-RAY FACEBOOK POSTAP: \u201cKansas Sen.

The American College of Radiology Association PAC disclosed to federal regulators that it spent nearly $43,000 last week on mailings supporting Roberts in his bid for a fourth six-year term.

The Clinton campaign announced the \u201cMi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto\u201d\u2014or \u201cMy Dream, Your Vote\u201d\u2014program on Sunday. The program uses stories about illegal immigrant children who are prohibited from voting to inspire Latino voters to register and vote against Donald Trump and Republicans, the Associated Press reported. Astrid Silva, the 28-year-old illegal immigrant who railed against Donald Trump during a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention, was featured in the Clinton campaign\u2019s press release announcing the new \u201cDreamer\u201d effort. Silva said in the press release that while young illegal immigrants may not have the right to vote, the new effort will \u201chelp ensure that our stories are heard and it will send a clear signal to Donald Trump that we cannot be silenced.\u201d Silva is the organizing director of the Progressives Leadership Alliance of Nevada, a social and environmental justice group that is already involved in a massive campaign to register 400,000 Hispanic voters for the November election. That effort, known as the \u201cFamilies Fight Back\u201d campaign, is almost entirely funded by liberal billionaire George Soros. Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon.",

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Mexican Ranchera music legend Vicente Fernandez will campaign for presidential front runner Hillary Clinton, campaign aides told Fox News Latino. Fernandez, a musical icon to many Mexican-American households, also will hold a debate watch party in Nevada next Wednesday. Known as the \"King of Ranchera,\" Fernandez officially endorsed Clinton last month. During her Western state swing this week, which included a visit to the battleground state of Nevada, Clinton won several other influential endorsements within the Latino community, including an endorsement from Latina magazine, a publication that had not endorsed a presidential candidate in over 20 years. \"After enduring a targeted onslaught on our community by Donald Trump for the past 16 months, the stakes for Latinas has never been greater,\" the magazine announced in a statement. Another influential Hispanic group, the National Council of La Raza Action Fund, will endorse Clinton before the debate, Fox News Latino has confirmed. Recent polls show a tight race in Nevada, with Clinton opening up a four point lead over Trump in a Public Policy Polling survey released Wednesday. Clinton\u2019s campaigning in Las Vegas on Wednesday was an attempt to galvanize Latino voters in the swing state. \"Who is ready to vote in this election?\" she asked several thousand Nevada supporters. Clinton also tried to appeal to Hispanic voters by speaking of \"dreamers\" that she has encountered on the campaign trail. \"I\u2019ve met dreamers who want to start businesses, dreamers who want to go to medical or law school, who have big dreams,\" Clinton said. \"By following dreams they\u2019ll help economy.\" The last presidential debate will be held in Las Vegas on Wednesday at 9pm ET and will be moderated by Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace.

While many officers are killed in the line of duty \u2013 27 in 2013 alone \u2013 the New York murders come after weeks of protests aimed at officers and encouraged by the president over the deaths of criminal suspects in Missouri and New York.

With police departments across the country on high alert for similar attacks and protests still ongoing, will Obama feel obliged to interrupt his winter break to offer some guidance on the subject? He broke away briefly from his summer vacation to make remarks about the beheading of an American at the hands of Islamist militants. The pressure is growing from police and their supporters for Obama to do the same for the slain officers.

Beginning at 8 a.m. Monday, more than 22,000 Arizonans who have qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will become legally able to drive. But first they have to apply for and qualify for a license\u2026The rush comes following a preliminary injunction issued Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell prohibiting Arizona from refusing to license DACA recipients. These are individuals who arrived in this country illegally as children and meet other conditions\u2026ADOT spokesman Tim Tait said the licenses issued to dreamers will be identical to those given to other Arizonans who meet the requirements to drive -- with one significant difference: The licenses will self-destruct on a regular basis.

But the issue of how to use \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d has divided Republicans, with some calling for it to be implemented to overhaul the tax code or to push through major energy reforms. The tool is useful because it could allow newly-empowered Senate Republicans to pass legislation with a 51-vote simple majority rather than the usual 60, greatly increasing the chances of moving legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk. And while Obama is certain to veto anything that tries to roll back his landmark healthcare law, Republicans increasingly see reconciliation as an important messaging tool to help paint a contrast with Democrats on Obamacare ahead of 2016\u2026Republicans will likely settle on a strategy in mid-January when they map out their 2015 agenda at a joint House and Senate retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

But how did a decidedly German car end up with a decidedly non-German name like Mercedes. It was on this day in 1900 that Austrian car racer, Emil Jellinek became the first Mercedes owner. So eager for a sleeker and lighter car that would travel faster and win races easily, Jellinek went to the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft plant demanding the fastest car they could create. He negotiated a deal to purchase 36 vehicles and as part of the package, Daimler agreed to name the line after his then 11-year-old daughter, Mercedes. The car was such a hit that two years later the company legally registered the Mercedes name and Jellinek himself changed the family name to Jellinek-Mercedes in appreciation for his latest race cars.

But neither she nor her hosts seemed the slightest bit embarrassed. They should have been. Having a Democratic frontrunner who is currently embroiled in a scandal involving her unprecedented efforts to conceal her activities as a cabinet official handing out the hardware and taking no questions should have been impossibly awkward. Instead, it provides a good indication of the level of scrutiny to which Clinton can expect to be subject in her campaign.

There are nearly unending questions, many of them fresh, about Clinton\u2019s private server and her destruction of tens of thousands of emails from her time as secretary of state. Clinton is taking the final steps before the public launch of her second presidential campaign in the midst of stonewalling the press, but no one seemed to mind. [AP: \u201c[President Obama] and [Hillary Clinton] met privately at the White House Monday afternoon\u2026Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton posted a message on Twitter praising Obama's health care law\u2026\u201d]Beat-sweeteners unite \u2013 Clinton talked about problems with her \u201crelationship\u201d with the news media, as if it were simply a misunderstanding or a matter of overcoming past mistrust. In the establishment media narrative, the question is whether the presumptive nominee will just \u201clet her guard down\u201d and let the people and the press see the \u201creal her.\u201d That\u2019s just a bidding war among beat-sweetening reporters who are auditioning for access, implicitly promising to offer the perfect depiction of a strong-yet-nurturing-yet-funny-yet-thoughtful-yet-open-minded-yet-experienced candidate. It has nothing to do with the questions Clinton prefers to leave unanswered about her electronic antics or her buckraking from questionable sources around the globe. Nor does it address what she plans to do about the growing pressure for her to hand over her servers to a third party for review.Flattened out - Though Charlie Cook argues today that Clinton will continue to take blows from the press, Monday\u2019s spectacle was probably a much better indication of the kind of kid-glove treatment Clinton will mostly receive. Clinton can count on the fact that mainstream coverage of her bid will be more like that given to a new product launch from an old institution than that which should be given to an actual candidate seeking the presidency. The danger for Clinton, though, is that the media mandarins who murmured and applauded their way through her remarks are increasingly being replaced by hungrier, younger reporters at new outlets. Clinton was not able to deal with the disruptions wrought by social media in her first presidential run. The world has changed dramatically in the past eight years, and she may not be ready to meet the challenge.Hillary never had an inspector general at State - Bloomberg: \u201cOne of the many unanswered questions of the Hillary Clinton e-mail story has been: Whose job was it to raise and address concerns about her exclusive use of a private account?

The letter, which was drafted in early March but released on Monday, warns Obama that \u2018permanent sanctions relief from congressionally-mandated sanctions would require new legislation\u2019 from Congress. \u2018Congress must be convinced that its terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb, and only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions relief,\u2019 reads the letter, led by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and ranking member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.).\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...The New Criterion offers the remarkable story of the Kamuzu Academy in heart of Malawi, where the country\u2019s former dictator Hastings Kamuzu Banda ordained that a preparatory school built on the Eton model would teach the classics of Greek and Latin literature.

The senator discussed his emotionally trying upbringing as the son of a Cuban refugee father and pioneering computer programmer mother \u2014 emphasizing how his Delaware-native mother advanced at work during a period when women were discouraged from pursuing careers.\u201d Paul hits Cruz on \u2018winability\u2019 - \u201cRight now, I\u2019m the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states. There will be a lot of conservatives. Ted Cruz is a conservative, but it also goes to winability. And people will have to make a decision: Which is the Republican that can not only excite the base but can also bring new people into the party without giving up principles?\" \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d\u00a0 Watch here.Right face - WaPo takes a detailed look at how, with Cruz in, the race for the GOP right is heating up: \u201c[A]t least a half-dozen credible contenders are likely to join Cruz in competing for the hearts of conservatives. They face a labyrinth of tests of ideology and temperament, on talk radio and at tea party and faith forums, in a melee to become the hard right\u2019s standard-bearer.\u201dHillary\u2019s camp: Cruz is good news - \u201cThose closest to the former secretary of state have counseled patience, arguing that a core element of Clinton\u2019s plan was to get out of the way and let the dueling wings of the Republican Party savage each other while she floats above it all, Politico reports. Cruz, they say, is Hillary\u2019s wrecking ball.\u201dCruz tipped Rubio - Politico: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz surprised many political observers by becoming the first official presidential candidate for 2016 on Monday. But not Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio (R-Fla.) said he got a heads-up from his conservative colleague last week that the announcement was forthcoming, and Rubio praised Cruz (R-Texas) several times during a lengthy gaggle with Capitol Hill reporters on Monday afternoon.\u201dTrump trolls Cruz on nativity - \u201cTed has just one extra level of complication\u2026 He was a Canadian and American citizen a couple of years ago.

The invitation asks for donations or for attendees to raise up to $100,000 per couple. The reception on behalf of the Right to Rise Super PAC will be held at the home of bank executive Gerald Ford and his wife Kelli\u2026The invitation, with the list of about 50 Texas supporters, indicates the millionaire-business class that have been big backers of establishment Republicans in Texas. Among those joining the event are real estate developer Woody Hunt, oil man T. Boone Pickens, attorney Mike Boone, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans, former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, former ambassador to Switzerland Pam Willeford, homebuilder David Weekley, former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler and beer distributor John Nau.

Bush.\u2019\u201d BIG WIN FOR WALKER AT SUPREME COURTWaPo: \u201cThe Supreme Court on Monday turned down a challenge to Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law, which it had previously kept from going into effect before November's elections. The court's decision not to review a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the law was a victory for Gov. Scott Walker (R) and perhaps other states that have tightened voting procedures to require additional identification. More challenges to specific state laws are in the pipeline.\u201dCOMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE, 2.0: KASICH HITS THE TRAILCincinnati Enquirer: \u201cOhio Gov. John Kasich is testing his potential presidential message in earnest this week, starting with a campaign trip in New Hampshire [today]. Will the trip springboard Kasich to the top of a crowded, but far from closed, GOP presidential field? Or will his presidential campaign fizzle before it kicks off? Here\u2019s what to watch Tuesday: What is Kasich\u2019s bedside manner as a \u2018retail politicker\u2019? \u2026Are these Kasich\u2019s voters? \u2026Will he make news, the kind of news he wants to make? \u2026Headlines often come from the most interesting thing a candidate says. Given Kasich\u2019s potential to give a frank, free-wheeling speech, possibilities abound. Kasich will ride the momentum of his New Hampshire visit [today], positive or negative, to New York City, where he\u2019ll give a speech Wednesday night to economists and political elite. Thursday he travels to Maine, for another balanced-budget amendment pitch.\u201d [Kasich\u2019s stops will include the Politics & Eggs breakfast, followed by a question and answer session with the Nashua Chamber of Commerce and finally a stop at Politics & Pie.]Social justice candidate - Yahoo\u2019s Andrew Romano takes an in-depth look at Kasich\u2019s effort to meld the social-justice doctrine of his faith with Republicanism: \u201cKasich is convinced that he\u2019s a different kind of Republican. \u2018For some reason, the Lord has made me more aware of people\u2019s problems,\u2019 Kasich told me in West Virginia. \u2018And I take that awareness seriously.\u2019 His mission now is to convince everybody else.\u201dEchoes of another race, another Bush - With Kasich little known in New Hampshire, AP notes how 2016 bears similarities to his 2000 effort against another Bush: \u201cKasich briefly sought the 2000 presidential nomination when then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush emerged as a force in Republican politics. Kasich remembers the challenge well. \u2018First of all I was a congressman, nobody knew who I was,\u2019 he said. \u2018Secondly, I didn't have a big financial base.\u2019 Third, \u2018I knew the handwriting was on the wall\u2019 pointing to Bush winning.\u201d [Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron is back on the trail bringing the latest from Kasich in the Granite State.]CAMPAIGN DAYBOOK* Former Sen.

Walking on eggshells might be politically correct, but it is a losing strategy. No one wants to see Caspar Milquetoast in the White House.\u201d --Joel Millman \u201cMy ideal Republican ticket for 2016 is John Kasich for president & Marco Rubio for vice-president. Both are well qualified & are from states the Republicans need to win the White House.\u201d \u2013 Douglas \u00a0Sorenson \u201cMarco Rubio has a history of getting things done by working across the aisle. He\u2019s bright, articulate, and has a personal immigration story that gives him personal experience and gravitas from which to speak. He could be a very attractive Republican uniter, if he can hold his own in the shake-out process.\u201d \u2013 John E Sutton\u201cWhile I like Ted Cruz, I believe he\u2019s too far to the right to attract the Independent voting block come the general election. My take is a Scott Walker/Carly Fiorina ticket would be the perfect GOP foil to Hillary\u2019s campaign. Carly could assail Hillary\u2019s record without the claims of sexism, and you know that\u2019s coming, and Walker has proven you can take on the union and still win three elections.\u201d \u2013 Dave LutterNEIGHBORS RELIEVED BY BURGLARYReuters: \u201cBritish police said on Monday they were hunting for thieves who broke into an apartment in northwest England and stole 38 Royal Python snakes.

            "article_content": "Every year we do this list -- this fantastically unscientific list, in which we acknowledge 100 brilliant ideas, companies and the founders behind them. This list represents everything that is great and meaningful in entrepreneurship and living in a country that celebrates and cheers for disruption. (Gotta love an election cycle.) It\u2019s sort of our kiss on the cheek and nod to innovation. Honestly, it\u2019s my favorite issue of the year because it captures the spirit of what we entrepreneurs stand for: boldness, creativity and collaboration. It\u2019s our essence, and more important, it\u2019s your essence. And in the spirit of disruption, this year we made a point of doing away with the traditional, quantifiable markers of brilliance -- revenue numbers, head count, archetype and whatnot -- to focus on the ideas, almost all fueled by passion and implemented by strong leaders who simply get shit done. This is our definition of brilliant, and this year all the visionaries we highlight really are freakin\u2019 brilliant. Here\u2019s the thing about brilliance: It can\u2019t be truly measured. It just is. We know this because we tried. There is nothing scientific or academic about being a brilliant entrepreneur. You can go to school for it. You can study it. But until you do it, you\u2019ll never get it. Entrepreneurship is equal parts science, art, luck and, yeah, capital, but an infusion of cash doesn\u2019t always equal great new ideas. In fact, an absence of funding often leads to the breakthroughs that become brilliant ideas. That\u2019s why I love this list so much. Time will tell whether the companies, entrepreneurs and ideas we profile become the next big thing or flame out before Christmas, but their influence will certainly last. That\u2019s because great ideas generate the next wave of game-changing ideas, and so on. I see it repeated year after year. One thread of an idea can spawn generations of brilliance. That\u2019s the goal of our unscientific look at how cool humans can be. To data wonks and business purists, we may sound like lightweights here, but I submit that we are not. Every day, high-priced, by-the-book MBAs are eclipsed by the artists, the creatives, the poets and the dreamers. No b-school would ever make the case for landing a used rocket on a tiny platform in the middle of the ocean, but Elon Musk made it happen. Brilliant. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned -- and seen -- from covering this world for years, it is to never underestimate the power and force of the human spirit. So let your freak flag fly, guys. These are our brilliant freaks. All 100 of them. Now let the celebration begin.",

There\u2019s ongoing outrage over the fact that the administration put a Democratic partisan in charge of the investigation of partisan targeting at the Obama IRS. And that\u2019s just this week\u2019s news on Obama accountability. So given all that, and the scandals that came before, how likely are you to believe President Obama today when he says that internal measures will remedy problems with the domestic surveillance program that has blossomed on his watch? The president, dragging low job approval and weak measures on public trust in him and his administration, will announce that Attorney General Eric Holder and his team will get a handle on the spy game. That\u2019s going to be a tough sell.

The official said Obama believes the program is important but can be preserved while addressing privacy and civil liberties concerns. From the talking points: -- Effective immediately, the administration will modify the program so that a judicial finding is required before querying the database. -- Obama has asked the attorney general and the intelligence community to report back to him before the program comes up for reauthorization on March 28 -- Obama will consult with the relevant committees in Congress to seek their views [Watch Fox: President Obama delivers remarks on the NSA in the 11 a.m. ET hour.] KELLY FILE: NOW YOU TELL US\u2026National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier told Megyn Kelly that President Obama \u201chas not earned our trust\u201d on domestic spying. \u201cFrom the beginning they haven\u2019t been very transparent about explaining what it is we\u2019re doing and why so we really have to be real careful, really look hard at what the president says...,\u201d Fournier said on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Watch the full interview here.

NO ENTITLEMENT REFORM: HILLARY EMAIL SCANDAL REVEALS CORE WEAKNESSIf you were one of the many, many people running the second presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, what is one thing you absolutely, positively, double-dog, by-jiminy would not want your candidate to be doing tonight? Other than perhaps hosting an event on electronic transparency for the exiled government of Libya, Clinton has found absolutely the worst place to be. She is going to attend a gala at a super-posh venue on Wall Street for her family foundation. Woof. Hitting what reportedly will be a glitzy event to raise more money from the global upper crust for a foundation at the center of a fundraising fiasco would be bad enough for the presumptive Democratic nominee even without the bizarre new and continually expanding scandal surrounding her private emails at the State Department. Prior to the new revelations, Clinton might have been able to blow off the press, schmooze with the .0001 percent and get back on the trail. But the revelations will turn tonight into a public embarrassment fitted like Versace gown for political attacks rather than a private indulgence. [Power Play - How damaging will this latest scandal be and will Hillary need to come out and address it? Chris Stirewalt provides the lay of the land, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.]Enablers - One can\u2019t blame Clinton for the bad timing. She certainly knew that dodging transparency and accountability measures would result in a scandal, but she couldn\u2019t have known when. (When you are operating a \u201chomebrew\u201d server out of your house for official emails, you probably aren\u2019t figuring it\u2019s no big deal.) She must have imagined that she could ride out the bad press and that the disruption would be worth the advantages offered by secrecy and unaccountability. One cannot blame Clinton for the disastrous timing of this concatenation, but if she and her family can\u2019t resist celebrating their Wall Street connections and big buckraking right now there is an evident lack of judgment at work. Through that lens, we get a better insight on why Clinton felt she could operate her own private email system when she worked for the government. Because she felt entitled to do so. As her campaign lumbers and lurches forward, we see entitlement at the core of many of Clinton\u2019s problems. If there is not one of her many advisers who are able to convince Clinton that she must learn to live by the rules, this candidacy will be just as doomed as the last one.Sauce for the goose\u2026 \u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, it looks like they were trying to avoid the records act ... by operating official business off the official systems,\u201d \u2013John Podesta, top adviser to Hillary Clinton, criticizing the Bush administration officials for using private emails in a 2007 WSJ interview.[\u00c0 la Haig - Buzzfeed\u2019sBen Smith got a telling response to a question he posed to John Podesta on Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201c\u2026when I am in charge of the campaign I will return your calls.\u201d]Look over here! - The Clinton campaign network sent a letter to Florida\u2019s Department of State Tuesday \u201c\u2026requesting unreleased emails sent from Jeb Bush\u2019s private email account during his time as governor. Recently, Bush was quick to brag about releasing 250,000 emails in his ostensible devotion to transparency -- but Bush said he received 550,000 emails on his private account and 2.5 million emails on his public account during his gubernatorial tenure.\u201d [The Atlantic dives into Clinton\u2019s longstanding contempt for transparency and accountability measures, at least when applied to her.](WHITE) HOUSE OF PAIN: NO PLAN TO AID THOSE WHO COULD BEAR BRUNT IN OBAMACARE CASEWith Supreme Court arguments today on a case that could blow the bottom out of ObamaCare and put policies for millions at risk, the president and his team is reverting to the Clubber Lang doctrine for such standoffs. Their prediction: Pain. As the NYT reports, the administration is intentionally refusing to consider any backup plans at the risk of signaling \u201cto the justices that reasonable solutions existed.\u201d\u00a0 And if past conduct is indicative, the president must also hope that by maximizing suffering in the short term, he can better block Republican alternatives and gain the upper hand on preserving his law in the eventual rescue operation. Meanwhile, no fewer than four Republican plans have emerged. The most recent is from by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and five co-sponsors, including Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. There are other, potentially complementary, plans already on offer including one includes financial assistance for individuals who would lose coverage, another that would offer tax credits and the one perhaps best suited for an emergency measure sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb.Government case rests in part on Jonathan Gruber\u2019s honesty - WaPo: \u201cMIT economist Jonathan Gruber first earned notoriety because of this challenge. Opponents of the law last summer circulated a 2012 video of him saying \u2014 contrary to the administration's argument \u2014 that states would deprive their residents of subsidies if they didn't set up their own exchanges.

And most importantly, President Obama is sure to blame Republicans if the impact of the case is lost coverage or higher premiums.

Mr. Obama\u2019s Nov. 20 announcement offered a number of different benefits to illegal immigrants, including expanding eligibility for his 2012 amnesty for Dreamers and boosting the amount of time he was granting an amnesty form deportation and permits for legal work from two years to three years. While the administration hadn\u2019t begun collecting applications under the expanded eligibility, it had awarded tens of thousands of three-year permits to applicants who had qualified as Dreamers under the original rules from 2012.\u201d [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the GOP fight to block President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.]NOT JUST BIBI: PRESSURE GROWS TO NIX DEAL ON IRAN NUKESReuters: \u201cU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry flies to Riyadh this week to try to reassure King Salman that any nuclear deal with Iran will be in Saudi interests, despite the kingdom's fears that it may boost Tehran's backing for Shi'ite Muslim groups in the region. \u2026 While the main critics of the U.S. push for a nuclear deal with Iran are Israel and Congressional Republicans, Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia is also concerned that an accord would allow Iran to devote more cash and energy to Shi'ite proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, escalating conflicts. \u2018The Saudis fear Obama will give the Iranians a deal whatever the cost because it is important for his legacy and that Iran will get a certain regional status in exchange for an agreement,\u2019 said one diplomat in the Gulf.\u201dWords that Hurt - \u201cMr. Kerry fancies himself a shrewd statesman on the global stage. But, in truth, history only remembers for his failure to beat former President George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election. Unless, of course, he strikes a deal with Iran that leads to the annihilation of Israel. Then he will finally be remembered for something else.\u201d \u2013 Charles Hurt writing in his column for today.WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...If you start today, you could serve homemade corned beef on St. Patrick\u2019s Day.

[Fox News First officially recommends the often-underestimated eye of round, but hey, it\u2019s your pickled portion.] Corned beef is, of course, an American nod to our Irish roots not an Irish export. The recipe as we know it likely resulted from Irish immigrants using fresh, fatty cuts available here to replicate the taste of the lean, salted beef that would have been a luxury item for peasants over there. The result was a delicious cross-cultural phenomenon. How cross-cultural? This great recipe comes from renowned California butcher Aaron Rocchino. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Scott Walker on Tuesday embraced a move to ban abortion after 20 weeks after repeatedly declining to spell out where he stood on the issue in last year's re-election campaign. Wisconsin Right to Life has touted as its top priority legislation that has yet to be introduced that would\u00a0prevent women from seeking abortions in most cases after 20 weeks. Walker said in last year's campaign he opposed abortion, but refused to say whether he supported banning the procedure after 20 weeks\u2026In a\u00a0Tuesday letter, he addressed specific legislation head on. \u2018As the Wisconsin legislature moves forward in the coming session, further protections for mother and child are likely to come to my desk in the form of a bill to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks,\u2019 his letter said. \u2018I will sign that bill when it gets to my desk and support similar legislation on the federal level.

The requested limit, confirmed by multiple people familiar with the amount, may mark the first time that a presidential hopeful has sought to hold off supporters from contributing too much money. The move reflects concerns among Bush advisers that accepting massive sums from a handful of uber-rich supporters could fuel a perception that the former governor is in their debt. The effort is also driven by a desire to build as broad a pool of donors as possible among wealthier contributors. \u2026His potential rivals have acknowledged that they have little hope of matching his current pace.

Central Pennsylvania seems to have been the epicenter of the boom, with special credit belonging to radio station WKBO in Harrisburg, which marked the selection of Frank Knox as the 1936 Republican vice presidential nominee a day of the jokes. Get it? Knox-Knox. Clubs of knock-knock lovers, musical numbers and appearances in movie scripts followed as craze intensified, as did the corresponding loathing among sophisticates. In time, the jokes receded to being mostly kids\u2019 stuff, as they provide a great formula for young jokesters who are learning about comedic timing.

            "article_content": "Correspondent Doug McKelway reports from Washington The night of Donald Trump\u2019s big Indiana Republican primary win, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was ready. She tore loose with a series of late-night anti-Trump tweets in which she accused him of racism, sexism, xenophobia, narcissism and a host of other faults. Two weeks earlier, after\u00a0being asked about another Warren tweet storm in which she accused him of being \"a loser,\" Trump fired a warning shot across Warren's bow. \"Who's that, the Indian? You mean the Indian,\" he responded, referring to a well-known political controversy over Warren claiming Indian heritage. The exchanges signal the start of what could be a nasty surrogate side-battle as the general election campaign begins to take shape. Warren is poised to be an aggressive Trump critic, for the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, should she lock up the nomination. And for Trump, who thrives off detecting weakness and pouncing, Warren is a target-rich environment. From 1986 to 1995, she listed herself as a minority in the Association of American Law Schools directory. Harvard Law School cited her alleged Indian heritage in dealing with criticism that it lacked a diverse faculty. Her recipe in the \"Pow Wow Chow\" cookbook became the subject of derision, after charges it was plagiarized from a New York Times cookbook. \"I think she's a fraud,\" said longtime nemesis and Boston conservative talk radio host, Howie Carr. \"I think her entire success in academia and in politics is based on a lie that she's a Native American. She refuses to take a DNA test. She doesn't even call herself Native American, anymore,\" he said. Asked what the purpose of that alleged fraud would have been, Carr said, \"She was basically going nowhere in her academic career. She was an instructor at the University of Texas Law School in Austin.\u00a0Suddenly she began checking the box and she was a tenured professor first at the University of Pennsylvania, and then she got a job at Harvard University law school. \" Warren's office did not respond to requests for an interview. Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grassroots organization that raised over a million dollars in small donations for Warren's Senate campaign against Scott Brown, believes that Warren relishes baiting Trump and welcomes renewed scrutiny, should it come. \"The more that Donald Trump takes the bait and attacks Elizabeth Warren, and thrusts Elizabeth Warren to the center of the national dialogue, the better for Hillary Clinton because the issues that Elizabeth Warren is fighting for are overwhelmingly popular with general election voters -- from expanding Social Security to alleviating student debt to taking on the big Wall Street banks,\" he said. Her critics, among them former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, whom she beat in the 2012 Senate race, suggest Warren's Twitter tear is not accidental. \"She's been getting on Twitter more and more and criticizing Trump like she is the pit bull for the Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee,\u00a0and, I would suspect, Hillary Clinton,\" he said. Carr added,\u00a0\"I think Hillary Clinton is giving her instructions. She's going to put on her war bonnet and go out and attack Donald Trump.\" One of the ironies of this fight is that the two are vying, at least in part, for the same voters \u2013 blue-collar workers and swing-state independents who may well decide the election. Trump is trying to pull them right with promises of more coal and less regulation, while Warren, with her strong progressive bona fides, is pulling left with a call for more government safety nets and regulation.",

            "article_content": "Beth Reinhard, national politics reporter at the Wall Street Journal, weighs in After a week of roiling presidential race controversies -- including the release of Donald Trump's tax returns and Hillary Clinton's unflattering portrayal of millennial voters -- their running mates meet Tuesday for a debate where they hope to steady their respective campaigns and launch their own offensives. Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence so far have served in a traditional yeoman role, as Trump and Clinton occupy the limelight. Yet the two are seasoned politicians, ready and able to attack and parry on their nominees' behalf, at their only debate of the election season. Pence, Indiana\u2019s governor, on Monday hinted at his strategy -- attacking Clinton\u2019s long political career and critiquing Kaine\u2019s record as Virginia governor which Pence argues was marked by high unemployment and a tax-and-spend agenda. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d the 57-year-old Pence said while campaigning in central Virginia. \u201cClinton's record on foreign affairs alone could take up the whole 90 minutes. \u2026 I kind of hope we get to talk about our records as well because they\u2019re just a little bit different. When Tim Kaine was governor, he actually tried to raise taxes by $4 billion in four years.\u201d By Tuesday morning, their prime-time debate at Longwood University, in nearby Farmville, Va., had its own controversy. A new Republican National Committee video ad that hit Kaine for his legal representation of defendants convicted of violent crimes drew comparisons in some outlets to the infamous Willie Horton ad. That 1988 ad had hit Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, over convicted murderer Horton committing violent crimes while on furlough from his life sentence -- but was criticized for being racially charged. RNC strategist Sean Spicer initially tweeted a Roll Call article making the Willie Horton ad comparison, but then deleted the tweet. Spicer told Fox News on Tuesday that the RNC disagreed with the comparison to the 1988 ad. It's unclear whether Kaine's criminal justice record will in fact emerge at Tuesday's debate. The 58-year-old Kaine, a devout Catholic and Harvard Law School graduate, has said little about his debate strategy. \u201cIt's intense, but I'm calm. Things work out the way they are supposed to,\u201d he said after attending Mass on Sunday in Richmond. Clinton said Tuesday she thought Kaine would have a \u201cgreat\u201d debate performance, before flashing the thumbs-up sign. If Kaine\u2019s debate rhetoric is anything like that on the campaign trail, he will likely focus his attacks on Trump and what he considers the Republican presidential nominee's acceptance of \u201cbigotry, racism, xenophobia, anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant behavior\u201d from supporters. The focus of the debate is likely to stay trained on the presidential nominees themselves. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d on Monday to expect a prepared and \u201cfeisty Mike Pence,\u201d ready to challenge Clinton\u2019s record and \u201chold her accountable for the failures of her policies as secretary of state.\u201d Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker has stood in as Kaine in Pence\u2019s debate prep sessions, while Washington lawyer Robert Barnett has been playing the role of Pence in Kaine's preparations. Kaine spent several days preparing in Raleigh, N.C., and in his hometown of Richmond, about an hour west of the debate site. Close aides say Kaine has been studying \u201cbig binders\u201d of details and also knows the debate is \u201cabout the top of the ticket.\u201d One aide also told Fox News on Tuesday that the prep sessions have included \u201ca steady stream of black coffee, M&Ms and\u00a0downtime with staff and friends\u00a0to close each day.\u201d The Clinton-Kaine campaign has announced that Kaine has invited family and friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson to the debate. Trump, meanwhile, is taking heat over the details in newly published tax documents that allegedly show the nominee took more than $900 million in losses in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for as many as 18 years. The Clinton campaign over the weekend was forced to defend the candidate\u2019s remarks in a leaked audiotape from this winter in which she seemed to characterize young supporters of then-primary rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as children of the recession \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement.\u201d The vice presidential debate is always a more low-key affair than the trio of presidential showdowns. That's particularly true in an election where the candidates at the top of the ticket are such outsized figures who have been in the public eye for decades. While last week's first debate between Trump and Clinton drew a record-setting television audience of about 84 million people, the Pence-Kaine contest is expected to be watched by far fewer viewers.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (The Associated Press) Fifteen years after the worst terrorist attack in American history, the United States is safer than it was on the day destined to be forever known as 9/11. Yet the threat to the homeland is persistent, ubiquitous and far different than it was before fear of terrorism became part of our national psyche. The Sept. 11, 2001 attacks woke Americans up to the realization that we are not immune from the horror of terrorism that afflicts so many other countries. Every terrorist attack on American soil is devastating, even if relatively few have resulted in double-digit casualties (Fort Hood, San Bernardino and Orlando) and none have come close to replicating 9/11. The Boston Marathon bombing shook the national conscience. All the attacks were excruciating reminders of the omnipresent threat of terrorism on U.S. soil. Many plots have been stopped before they could reach maturation due to the diligent work of the NYPD and other agencies, the FBI and the intelligence community, all of whom have been given the resources to deal with the threat. Credit should also be given to everyday U.S. citizens, who are more cognizant of the threat posed by terrorism and more inclined to alert authorities if something seems out of place. That might be a byproduct of a Homeland Security campaign \u201cIf You See Something, Say Something,\u201d launched in July 2010. But it also might be an unintended consequence of the horrific event that was 9/11; the attack served to bring the nation together. As the country coped with the aftermath, the best of American values were on display, including respect for the dignity and rights of others and love of country. Congress came together and passed a $40 billion emergency appropriation. On September 11, 2001, I was a college senior studying in Ireland, headed for a media sales job in Manhattan. Then 9/11 changed the direction of my life. Growing up on Long Island, I\u2019d imagined careers in finance and law but \u201cterrorism expert\u201d wasn\u2019t on the list. After the attacks I was soon trying to figure out how I could finagle my way into a line of work that quickly became a personal obsession\u2014the study of terrorism. I had never heard of All Qaeda or Salafist jihadism. I didn\u2019t know the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite. While I could barely locate Afghanistan on a map, I knew that many of my friends and family members in the armed forces would soon be deploying overseas. My ignorance became my motivation, and my anger and frustration propelled me to seek knowledge. Within days, I decided to learn about and study the ideology, tactics and motivations of the group that had attacked America. I wanted to help figure out what the United States could do to mitigate this threat. Although my life\u2019s calling grew out of one of the saddest days in U.S. history, I now provide meaningful analysis on one\u00a0of the world\u2019s most intractable problems. The threat from terrorism is not static, so there is a dire need to keep addressing the problem from different angles to help policymakers reach effective solutions for a range of difficult issues. I can be a font of hope, and doom, often in the same sentence. At dinner parties, I am invariably a reluctant conversationalist when the question is, \u201cWhat do you do?\u2014which is often followed by requests for my professional analysis of the state of terrorism today. I know, too well, that 15 years after the attack that changed the nation forever, terrorists still scheme to harm the United States in the name of a deranged ideology. These terrorists are adaptive, resilient and widespread. The terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks,\u00a0 Al Qaeda, is still active, despite experiencing setbacks. Its offshoots, scattered around the globe from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, remain lethal.\u00a0 And its progeny, ISIS, is one of the most dangerous groups in the global jihadist movement. The virulent ideology that motivates jihadists is responsible for radicalizing American citizens who went on to commit acts of mass murder in such places as San Bernardino and Orlando. Countless other plots have been stopped before they could be carried out. New York City, in particular, remains a constant target for terrorists and violent extremists alike. There have been 20 known terrorist plots against New York City alone since 9/11. Yet here\u2019s the part that few want to hear when I start sharing counterterrorism details: The threat from terrorism is not going to go away in the foreseeable future. The U.S. counterterrorism community, along with the American public, needs to remain steadfast in the face of this enduring threat. What does that mean for\u00a0day-to-day life? In short, it means doing a lot of what we, as Americans, have already been doing. Analysis of the threat should continue to be based on data, empirical evidence and robust intelligence, not xenophobia or fear-mongering. The lure of election year demagoguery has proven to be a powerful elixir, but singling out a specific group based on ethnicity or religion will not make Americans safer. Although the global jihadist movement is protean, destroying known hubs and logistical networks can help keep the threat localized in many cases, relegating militants to failed states and ungoverned regions and making it more difficult for them to plan attacks. Reaction to what turned out to be false alarms regarding active shooters at New York and Los Angeles airports show that the fear of terrorism is still palpable -- and understandably so. America\u2019s citizens need to keep the threat from global terrorism in perspective without being dismissive about the very real potential danger. My sincerest hope is that those responsible for protecting the nation will reduce the need for terrorism analysis and put me out of a job within the next 15 years.",

            "article_content": "White House press secretary Josh Earnest answers a question about Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump during the daily press briefing on Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2015, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (The Associated Press) Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., right, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., leave a news conference following a GOP caucus meeting, at the Republican National Headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2015. Ryan dismissed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's comments on Muslims, saying such views are \"not what this party stands for and more importantly it's not what this country stands for.\"  (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 Donald Trump's plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States is shoving the Republican Party to the edge of chaos, abruptly pitting GOP leaders against their own presidential front-runner and jeopardizing the party's longtime drive to attract minorities. Unbowed, Trump fired a searing warning Tuesday via Twitter to fellow Republicans carping about his proposal. A majority of his supporters, he tweeted, \"would vote for me if I departed the GOP & ran as an independent.\" The crossfire between Trump and frustrated Republicans became a furious blur the day after the billionaire businessman announced his plan. Beleaguered 2016 rivals condemned his proposal and complained that his divisive positions were dominating attention in the crowded Republican contest. Party elders, meanwhile, warned that too much criticism might indeed push him to abandon the GOP and launch a third-party bid that could hand the presidential election to the Democrats. And Republicans up for re-election in the Senate grew terse in the Capitol hallways as they were asked again and again to respond to Trump's remarks \u2014 a glimpse of their political futures if the former reality show star captures the GOP nomination. \"This is not conservatism,\" declared House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican Party's top elected leader. \"What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it's not what this country stands for.\" One by one, Republican officials across the country lashed out at Trump's plan, announced the night before, which calls for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" to help quell the threat of terrorism. But party leaders are well aware of the possibility that he could end up running against the GOP nominee next year if it's not him, a threat they have long feared. The Republican Party, said Jeb Bush adviser Ana Navarro, is stuck between \"a rock and a jerk\" less than eight weeks before the first primary-season votes are cast in Iowa. In New Hampshire, Republican National Committeeman Steve Duprey called Trump's idea \"abhorrent.\" At the same time, he reminded Trump of his Republican loyalty pledge, saying, \"I know him to be a man of his word.\" And in Mississippi, RNC member Henry Barbour said Trump's comments \"aren't worthy of someone who wants to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\" He said Trump would be a \"disaster politically for the GOP if he won the nomination.\" \"It's embarrassing at best,\" Barbour said of Trump's impact on his party. Barbour helped author the Republican National Committee's \"Growth and Opportunity Project\" after a painful 2012 presidential election that forced party leaders to re-evaluate their strategy in presidential contests to reflect the nation's demographic shifts. Among other things, the report cited an urgent need for GOP leaders to adopt an inclusive and welcoming tone on issues such as immigration. \"If we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,\" it read, noting that white voters made up a record-low 72 percent of the electorate in 2012 and would represent less than half of all voters by 2050. Yet Trump has vaulted to the top of the Republican 2016 field by attacking immigrants in many cases. He called some Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"criminals\" in his announcement speech and intensified his criticism of Muslim immigrants or visitors Monday evening. While experts widely consider his proposal unconstitutional, Trump's continued popularity underscores the deep divide between Republican leaders and the party's conservative base, which holds outsized influence in the presidential nomination process. Indeed, Trump's plan was cheered during a South Carolina rally Monday evening, and vocal supporters across the country defended the Muslim ban as necessary for national security. Polling suggests the sentiment is likely fueled by sharp strain of xenophobia: A new AP-GfK poll found 8 in 10 Republicans think there are too many immigrants coming from the Middle East. Trump showed little concern for critics on Tuesday. \"I don't care about them,\" he told CNN. \"I'm doing what's right.\" The debate over Trump's plan left his Republican presidential competitors struggling for attention with little time remaining before Iowa's Feb. 1 caucuses. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's calls on Tuesday for Congress to strengthen the nation's domestic surveillance program was little more than a coverage afterthought amid the wave of Trump stories.. So, too, was a new advertising campaign from allies of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush that assailed Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as unprepared to serve as commander in chief. Former technology executive Carly Fiorina flashed her frustration when asked repeatedly about Trump's comments as she campaigned in Iowa. \"Maybe you should quit focusing on Donald Trump so much,\" she told reporters. Trump's position has also forced vulnerable Republicans facing re-election next year into an awkward position. Those who weighed in at all condemned his plan but also stepped carefully. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte said she opposes any \"religious-based test for our immigration standards,\" but she declined to criticize Trump directly when pressed by reporters. Some Republicans not facing election next year were less cautious. \"It does not reflect serious thought. It's not our party. It's not our country,\" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. told reporters. ___ AP writers Erica Werner in Washington, Catherine Lucey in Des Moines, Iowa, Jill Colvin in Newark, New Jersey, and Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.",
