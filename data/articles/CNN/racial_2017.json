            "article_content": "Trump is known for collecting advice from guests and friends at his Florida club He will be on vacation through New Year's Chief of staff more interested in knowing who Trump speaks to than stopping the conversations Minutes before President Donald Trump departed the White House on Friday for his languid Florida hideaway, he appeared to exasperate aides who had hoped he might avoid holding court with the press. Trump visited his properties over 100 times this year \u201cHelicopter is running out of gas,\u201d his chief of staff, John Kelly, announced, not-so-gently nudging the assembled reporters and cameramen from the Oval Office as Trump continued to happily answer their questions. White House aides, wishing for the President to depart Washington without venting about the Russia probe or his other political woes, were largely successful in avoiding pratfalls that might obscure the Republicans\u2019 tax victory this week. Vacationing in Florida for the first extended period in months, however, Trump isn\u2019t likely to find himself under as strict restraints. At Mar-a-Lago, an oceanfront paean to Trump himself, the President is prone to holding court at will, consulting advisers both real and self-imagined, and basking in the knowledge that he\u2019s the only man in charge. RELATED: Trump visited his properties over 100 times this year Topics on the table include the future of key Cabinet officials like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Middle East policy and the makeup of his political team. Overall, it\u2019s a welcome break from a White House that has at times chafed on the freewheeling President. The White House is bracing for 2018 challenges A new system of rigor enacted by Kelly has limited the number of calls Trump receives from the kitchen cabinet of informal advisers that he relied upon in the early days of his presidency. Trump has allowed Kelly\u2019s system to proceed, believing it effective, but has complained at times as well. In Florida, there\u2019s little expectation that Kelly or any other adviser can fully limit the President\u2019s conversations with the friends and paying Mar-a-Lago members he\u2019s developed relationships with over decades. Kelly, who is expected to travel with Trump for some portion of his vacation, has told associates he\u2019s more interested in knowing who the President is speaking with than preventing the conversations from happening. When Trump visited his club earlier this month, he arrived as a surprise guest at a holiday party being held in the expansive ballroom, shaking hands and patting the backs of guests who hadn\u2019t seen him since he last visited the club in the spring, according to a person who was there. Later he greeted members sitting by the pool and dining on the patio. If past is precedent, Trump will take his work to the array of friends and associates who arrive nightly to Mar-a-Lago\u2019s Dorian stone gates. He prowled the floor of Mar-a-Lago at Thanksgiving dinner a year ago asking guests who he should select as secretary of state: Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani (neither man was named to any administration post). Trump issues his first commutation More recently, he phoned friends asking for advice about whether to commute the sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, who\u2019d been serving a 27-year prison sentence for bank fraud. Included in Trump\u2019s Florida set: Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, who the President spoke with Thursday evening before flying to Palm Beach; Ike Perlmutter, the Marvel Comics chief, who has advised Trump on veterans issues; Ron Lauder, the cosmetics heir who lobbied for his son-in-law to become Federal Reserve chairman; and Chris Ruddy, the Newsmax CEO, who acts as a TV surrogate. Trump\u2019s extended family has also descended on Mar-a-Lago as Christmas nears. First lady Melania Trump has been at the property for nearly a week already. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have arrived with their families. And Tiffany Trump, a student at Georgetown Law school, flew with the President aboard Air Force One to Florida on Friday. Not in Palm Beach this Christmas: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose past feuds with Trump seem to have evaporated, at least for now, after the tax win. \u201cI\u2019m going to a bowl game in Jacksonville,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s about as close as I\u2019ll get to Mar-a-Lago.\u201d RELATED: McConnell on Trump: \u2018I\u2019m warming up to his tweets\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ll be working in Florida \u2013 I\u2019ll be working very hard during that Christmas because we have many things we\u2019re talking about, including North Korea, including a lot of things happening in the Middle East, as you know,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. That may not be strictly true \u2013 the President is spotted on the golf course nearly every weekend that he spends in South Florida \u2013 but Trump has at moments converted his 90-year-old compound into the center of power for the US government, complete with strategy sessions on the patio and top-secret briefings carried out in converted anterooms. RELATED: The White House is bracing for 2018 challenges In Florida for his first Christmas as President, Trump is expected to begin work on his State of the Union address, due to be delivered at the end of January. And he\u2019s said he\u2019ll continue weighing his next legislative priority, either welfare reform or a new infrastructure package. 7 women in politics to watch in 2018 People close to him say Trump is also likely to reflect on the makeup of his team as he approaches the one-year mark of his presidency. Buoyant in his tax achievement, Trump isn\u2019t likely to demand a dramatic overhaul of his inner circle. But cognizant of impending departures of key West Wing and Cabinet staff, the President will contemplate his options. That includes what to do with Tillerson, the beleaguered secretary of state, who has insisted that he\u2019ll remain in place even as some White House aides are working to choreograph his exit. This week\u2019s high-profile actions by US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, praised exuberantly by Trump in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, only exacerbated the impression that she and not Tillerson is the administration\u2019s foreign policy star. Trump is also facing pressure to revamp his political operation after election defeats in Virginia, New Jersey and Alabama. A spat in the Oval Office between current and former members of his political operation highlighted the different factions pulling at the President as midterm congressional elections near. Members still flock to Trump\u2019s club when he is in town, despite strict security measures and new rules against taking photos in the dining room when the President is around. Reservations are required two weeks in advance, and new limits have been placed on the number of guests that members are permitted to bring. The ticket prices for New Year\u2019s Eve are also going up. Tickets are going for up to $600 for members and $750 for guests, an increase from 2016\u2019s prices of $525 for members and $575 for guests, Politico reported. In the year that Trump has been President, not everyone has viewed his private oceanfront club with new luster. More than a dozen charity groups abandoned plans to host fund-raisers at Mar-a-Lago after Trump made equivocal remarks about racial violence in Virginia. And Palm Beach County continues to strain at the costs required to keep Trump\u2019s facility secure while he\u2019s here. The Department of Homeland Security announced this week that it was awarding a $3.3 million grant to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office for costs associated with presidential protection. But for a President who\u2019s nearly completed a chaotic year of governing, the familiar Mar-a-Lago cloisters and the wealthy snowbirds who populate them provide a reminder of when life seemed easier. \u201cIt\u2019s my second home,\u201d Trump told a group of schoolchildren in March. \u201cI\u2019m here all the time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jones, a 63-year old attorney from Birmingham, has never run for office before Jones was the lead prosecutor suing KKK members responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing In the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Republican Alabama Senate hopeful Roy Moore, all eyes are on his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. Alabama has long been ruby red, but that could change after The Washington Post reported Thursday about an allegation of sexual abuse against a 14-year-old when he was in his 30s. Moore denies the allegations, painting it as an attempt by the national Democratic Party to discredit his frontrunning candidacy before his December 12 special election face-off against Jones. Jones has responded to the allegations made against Moore, issuing a statement to CNN saying, \u201cRoy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.\u201d Jones, a 63-year-old attorney from Birmingham, has never run for office before. In 2016, Alabama voted for Trump with a 28-point landslide. Alabama has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since\u00a0Richard Shelby was re-elected in 1992. However, Shelby became a Republican in 1994 and still serves in that seat as a member of the GOP. Roy Moore beats out candidate Trump supported In 1997, then-President Bill Clinton named Jones as the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama in Birmingham. Five years later in 2002, Jones served as the lead prosecutor in a case against two of the four Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in September 1963. This act of racial violence killed four African-American girls during church services. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had called it \u201cone of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity.\u201d Jones was also involved in the prosecution of Eric Rudolph, whose 1998 attack on a Birmingham abortion clinic killed an off-duty police officer. Rudolph was sentenced in 2005, after Jones left office. Who exactly is Roy Moore? Referencing his time going after the KKK, Jones wrote a Huffington Post op-ed in September, saying that he does not want to let history repeat itself. \u201cSadly, the pattern of violence as a response to hope has reasserted itself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe saw it in the Charleston church massacre in 2015. We saw it on display in Charlottesville this past August. We\u2019ve seen it in the attacks on mosques and synagogues, and against the LGBT community. We see it in the hostility toward the Latino community. We cannot sweep this violence under the rug. We must address the forces that lead to it and prosecute those who perpetrate such acts,\u201d Jones wrote. Jones won the Democratic primary in August, defeating seven other candidates and taking home 63.6% of the vote. Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Moore, the former Alabama chief justice who beat President Donald Trump-backed candidate Sen. Luther Strange in the primary in September, is known for being anti-establishment. Former Trump aides Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka stumped for him in the days leading up to the runoff, and right-wing favorite Sarah Palin also joined him on the campaign trail. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify the nature of the legal proceedings in which Jones prosecuted former Ku Klux Klan members.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, Alabamians will finally decide who is going to be their next US senator. For more than a month, coverage of the race has largely been dominated by Roy Moore and accusations that he pursued relationships with teenagers, sexually abused a 14-year-old and sexually assaulted a 16-year-old when he was in his 30s. Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations. But the accusations against the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court are only the latest scandal to hit Alabama politics. Last year, a sex scandal forced the state\u2019s governor, Robert Bentley, from office. In some ways, that scandal \u2013 which raised questions about Bentley\u2019s decision to appoint Moore\u2019s main primary opponent, Luther Strange, to the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became US attorney general \u2013 set the stage for this week\u2019s election. Before Moore goes head-to-head with Democrat Doug Jones on Tuesday, catch up on the events that have brought us to this point. The story begins in March 2016. Several months after his wife of 50 years divorced him, Bentley becomes mired in a sex scandal involving one of his top political aides, Rebekah Mason. Audio of Bentley making explicit comments to Mason \u2013 recorded two years earlier by his then-wife \u2013 is published by AL.com. Bentley admits it\u2019s his voice on the tapes, but both he and Mason deny they had a \u201cphysical affair.\u201d As Bentley deals with the fallout over his scandal, another controversy unfolds for Alabama\u2019s chief justice. On September 30, Moore is suspended without pay for the remainder of his term because of an order he made prohibiting probate judges to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Moore\u2019s order came in January 2016, months after the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage. Moore appealed the decision. Moore had previously been vocal about his opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage. Following the decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, Moore said the ruling was \u201ceven worse\u201d than the high court\u2019s 19th century decision to uphold racial segregation. Hours before Sen. Sessions is sworn in as Trump\u2019s attorney general, Bentley appoints state Attorney General Strange to fill Sessions\u2019 seat. The appointment prompts further controversy, and critics say there\u2019s a conflict of interest because Strange\u2019s office is believed to be investigating Bentley in connection to the sex scandal. Bentley also declines to order a statewide special election to replace Sessions, despite an Alabama statute saying that, in the event of a vacancy for US senator, the governor will \u201cforthwith order an election to be held.\u201d He cites the potential expense to the state and taxpayers when justifying the decision, and decides to let Strange hold the position until the next scheduled election in 2018. Only two months later, Bentley is under siege. An explosive report from the state House Judiciary Committee\u2019s special counsel accuses Bentley of abusing his power and using state resources to cover up his alleged relationship with Mason. On April 10, amid pressure, Bentley cuts a plea deal and resigns as Alabama\u2019s governor. He is succeeded by his lieutenant governor, Kay Ivey. On April 18, Ivey, who had \u201cpromised to steady our ship of state,\u201d announces the dates for the special election that Bentley had decided to forgo. Strange, who had already announced his intention to run in 2018, says he will campaign in the special election. The very next day, the Alabama Supreme Court upholds the decision by the Court of the Judiciary to suspend Moore from the state\u2019s high court. Moore \u2013 technically still an Alabama Supreme Court justice \u2013 says he will announce a decision about the Senate race the following week. On April 26, Moore officially resigns from the Alabama Supreme Court and announces his decision to run for the US Senate. \u201cMy position has always been God first, family, then country,\u201d he said on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery. \u201cI think I share, and I know I share, the vision of our President, Donald Trump, to make America great again.\u201d Because Alabama state law prohibits judges from running for another office, Moore would have had to resign from the bench in the middle of his appeal to run for Senate. But because a special election wasn\u2019t called until Bentley stepped down, Moore was able to see the result of his appeal before making the decision to pursue Sessions\u2019 vacant Senate seat. On August 8, days before the Republican primary, Trump tweets his endorsement of Strange. \u201cSenator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama,\u201d Trump writes. \u201cHe has my complete and total endorsement!\u201d Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement! It\u2019s later reported that Trump made the endorsement at the behest of his aides and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who consolidated the GOP establishment behind Strange. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon later endorses Moore. Despite the President\u2019s support, on September 26, Republicans in the Yellowhammer state throw their support behind Moore instead of Strange. Ultimately, Strange\u2019s opponents used the circumstances of his appointment by Bentley as a bludgeon against him, painting him as corrupt. Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec! Moore is officially headed to face Democrat Doug Jones, who won the Democratic primary on August 15. The Washington Post publishes a bombshell report on November 9 alleging Moore had pursued relationships with teenagers \u2013 including one as young as 14 years old, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Moore \u2013 while he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16. The story is based on interviews with more than 30 sources. Since the publication of the initial report, multiple women have come forward accusing the candidate of unwanted advances. Moore denies the allegations, calling them \u201ccompletely false,\u201d and threatens to sue the Post over the story. Almost a full month after Moore had come under fire, imperiling his chance to win the Senate seat, Trump calls Moore and endorses the candidate. Trump later frames a vote for Moore as something necessary to usher the GOP agenda through the US Senate. Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet! \u201cDemocrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNo to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!\u201d The Republican National Committee, which withdrew financial support from Moore\u2019s campaign in November, isn\u2019t far behind, and endorses Moore as well. On Friday night, Trump continued to stump for Moore, telling attendees of his rally in Pensacola, Florida, 25 miles from the Alabama state line, to \u201cget out and vote Roy Moore.\u201d Moore again denied the allegations against him Sunday in an interview on \u201cThe Voice of Alabama Politics.\u201d \u201cI did not know them,\u201d he said of his accusers. \u201cI had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone, and for them to say that, I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re saying it, but it\u2019s not true.\u201d Now, after months of scandal and controversy, all eyes turn toward Alabama, where Moore and Jones will face off on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump endorsed Senate candidate Roy Moore this week Even Moore's supporters have struggled to explain why they will vote for him Roy Moore is forcing Alabama Republicans to ask themselves some tough questions. Accusations that the Republican nominee for a US Senate seat from Alabama pursued relationships with teenagers, molested a 14-year-old and sexually assaulted a 16-year-old when he was in his 30s have thrown Tuesday\u2019s special election race into chaos. Republican leadership in Capitol Hill, the Republican National Committee and the White House for a time appeared to dump his candidacy \u2013 but now President Donald Trump, as well as party resources, are firmly back behind Moore, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, and his supporters predict a win. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see Roy Moore win pretty handily in Baldwin County,\u201d local Republican activist Matthew Brown told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a lower turnout than normal, but I think we\u2019re still going to see folks come to the polls, even folks who don\u2019t like the situation.\u201d Residents of Fairhope and Daphne, towns along the Eastern Shore of deeply red Baldwin County, represent the types of Republican voters Democratic candidate Doug Jones will have to cut into if he hopes to win, says Brown. Republicans here tend to be politically moderate, with higher incomes and higher levels of education, while lacking the racial diversity found in neighboring Mobile County. Signs supporting Jones scattered across lawns around Fairhope are raising some eyebrows in the area. Leslie Goldberg, who is 62 and has lived in the Fairhope area for 25 years, said she felt many Republican voters are hesitant. Black Democratic leaders will visit Alabama to help Doug Jones \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for Roy Moore, at all. For obvious reasons,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll that\u2019s left is Doug Jones, who of course is a Democrat. And then there\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about him either. But what\u2019s the worst of two evils?\u201d Still, many Alabama voters prioritize maintaining a slim two-seat majority in the Senate in Washington. And the national attention on Alabama\u2019s race has invigorated some local Republicans. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re voting against everybody who doesn\u2019t want Roy Moore,\u201d Brown told CNN of some area Republicans who are not fans of Moore. \u201cThey feel like there\u2019s this bigger thing they\u2019re voting against.\u201d RELATED: Roy Moore\u2019s incredible \u2018even though we had slavery\u2019 quote The national focus was in the forefront Tuesday night when former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon joined Moore for a rally in Fairhope. \u201cThey want to destroy judge Roy Moore and they want to take your voice away,\u201d Bannon told the crowd in Fairhope. \u201cIf they can destroy Roy Moore they can destroy you.\u201d Although few voters told CNN they\u2019d actually pull the lever for a Democrat, some voters expressed discomfort with some of Moore\u2019s stances. Is RNC Chair trying to have it both ways on Moore? Jones\u2019 pro-abortion-rights stance has cost him votes in Alabama but Moore\u2019s focus on religious beliefs turned off some voters even before the accusations against him. \u201cI feel like a lot of it is hot air,\u201d wedding planner Candy Williams said of Moore\u2019s controversial stances. \u201cI really think that Trump\u2019s endorsement is because we want the seat, but at which point do we just keep sweeping stuff under the rug?\u201d Williams, who supports Trump, told CNN she thought many voters wouldn\u2019t admit it publicly but would probably vote for Moore. Connie Holmes, a retired bookkeeper in Fairhope, said she had voted for Moore\u2019s primary opponent, incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to temporarily fill the seat after then-Sen. Jeff Sessions became Trump\u2019s attorney general. Holmes plans to cast a write-in vote for Strange, even it it could help Jones win. \u201cAt least I was thinking Luther,\u201d Holmes told CNN. \u201cEverything has gone haywire all of a sudden in the last six months.\u201d Some voters said the best case scenario would see Moore win and then be removed by the Senate Ethics Committee, leaving them with a new chance to elect a different Republican. Voters were also focused on supporting Trump\u2019s agenda in Washington, but many of the female voters in Fairhope who said they\u2019d vote for Moore didn\u2019t feel comfortable giving their names to CNN. \u201cI think all candidates have some disadvantages in the way they\u2019ve conducted themselves but I\u2019m probably leaning towards the Republican,\u201d Asheton Sawyer, a pastor at the Fairhope First Baptist Church, told CNN. \u201cLook at President Trump. I see some disappointments in him but I felt that he is probably the best for us right now.\u201d Lewandowski: Trump right to endorse Moore As the Republican Party continues to transform under the Trump presidency, Fairhope provides a hint of how some Republicans are struggling to adapt. Jimmy Babb, 51, who owns a local fitness business, told CNN he would vote for Moore even though he didn\u2019t agree with the way the candidate had handled controversies that led to his suspension as the state\u2019s Supreme Court chief justice. Babb, who supported Trump in 2016 and thinks the President is doing \u201cOK,\u201d is still wrestling with the accusations against Moore. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Dating young girls, I still have a tough time with it,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI wish we had better options.\u201d",

            "article_content": "African-Americans make up the majority of Democratic voters in Alabama But to win, Jones will have to pick off moderate white voters, too Doug Jones\u2019 bid to become the first Democrat to win a Senate race in Alabama in 25 years could hinge on whether he convinces African-Americans \u2013 the party\u2019s only reliable voting bloc in the deep-red state \u2013 to turn out in huge numbers. Jones faces an opponent in Roy Moore whose white evangelical base has stuck with him through decades of controversy \u2013 including two removals as state Supreme Court chief justice and the allegations that he pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls while in his 30s. Jones needs African-Americans \u2013 who make up the majority of Democratic voters in Alabama \u2013 to match the Moore base\u2019s furor. He\u2019s focused his schedule in the final two weeks of the race and his message on reaching those black voters. Jones campaigned last Friday in a predominantly black church on the anniversary of Rosa Parks\u2019 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger. On Saturday, he marched in the Christmas parade in Selma, the cite of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d voting rights march in 1965. Jones on Sunday visited nine churches in Tuscaloosa, courting largely black voters. GOP Sen. Jeff Flake writes check to Democrat opposing Roy Moore On the campaign trail, he\u2019s highlighted his work prosecuting two Ku Klux Klan members in a 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls \u2013 and contrasted it with the sexual allegations facing Moore. \u201cMen who hurt little girls should go to jail, not the United States Senate,\u201d he said in a speech Tuesday. But black leaders have criticized Jones, saying he hasn\u2019t offered enough details about what he\u2019d do for African-Americans if he wins. \u201cI think many of them are asking \u2018What are you going to do for me today?\u2019\u201d said State Rep. John Knight, the chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, who is supporting Jones. \u201cWe try to explain to them it\u2019s much more than just Doug Jones. It\u2019s the future of this state, it\u2019s their future, it\u2019s the image of Alabama, it\u2019s attracting jobs here.\u201d Poll: Doug Jones has slight lead in race against Roy Moore Black voters make up nearly 27% of Alabama\u2019s electorate \u2013 and those voters are the core Democratic electorate in a state where the parties are divided largely along racial lines: A CNN exit poll found that only 15% of white voters in Alabama backed Barack Obama in 2012, while 95% of black voters there supported Obama\u2019s re-election. Jones\u2019 campaign hopes to see African-Americans make up 27 to 28% of the electorate in Tuesday\u2019s special election. That wouldn\u2019t be enough on its own: Black voters were 28% of Alabama\u2019s electorate in 2012, and Obama still lost the state by 23 points. To win, Jones will have to pick off moderate white voters, too \u2013 or hope that they stay home \u2013 on top of African-American turnout close to Obama levels. Is that even possible? \u201cI hate to say it but he\u2019s no Barack Obama,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIn my opinion if you want that kind of turnout you need Barack Obama here,\u201d State Rep. Earl Hilliard said. Knight said the allegations facing Moore have \u201chelped in terms of energizing the base, but I think we still have a lot of work to do between now and December 12.\u201d These are the women who could elect Roy Moore \u201cI see some enthusiasm out there,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIt may not be obvious to many people, but as I travel, as I talk to people, they want a change. They want things to change in Washington and they see this as an opportunity, and Doug Jones is that opportunity.\u201d Thanks to an influx of online donations after the sexual allegations against Moore emerged, Jones is flush with enough cash to flood broadcast and cable TV and radio, including African-American stations, with ads, and he hasn\u2019t had to narrow his target on the airwaves. The candidate has also spent much of his time in the race\u2019s closing days and weeks personally courting black voters. He\u2019s campaigned alongside Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights icon, and at historically black colleges and universities including Tuskegee, Alabama State and Alabama A&M. He\u2019s a regular call-in guest on African-American radio shows \u2013 both in-state and those that are nationally syndicated. Rep. Terri Sewell, Alabama\u2019s only Democrat in Congress, has helped Jones make inroads with black leaders. African-American voters are also a major focus of a get-out-the-vote effort that so far includes 800,000 phone calls and 100,000 door knocks. \u201cI would say (black voters) do know who (Jones) is. I would say six days gives him enough time to close that gap,\u201d said Randall Woodfin, the Bernie Sanders-backed Democratic mayor of Birmingham, who ousted the incumbent Democrat in an October runoff. \u201cHere\u2019s how enthusiasm works: At a certain point, there\u2019s a tipping point where people are supporting that candidate that exceeds beyond race,\u201d Woodfin said. \u201cI think in the space we are now, this race is not boiling down to actual race. It\u2019s boiling down to who can represent us the best in Alabama; who\u2019s not going to embarrass us.\u201d Jones\u2019 campaign, aware that it\u2019ll need to pick off huge numbers of white, typically Republican voters, is careful to say it isn\u2019t tailoring its message along racial lines. \u201cWe want every vote we can get from white voters, black voters and anyone else who\u2019s participating in the process,\u201d said Giles Perkins, Jones\u2019 campaign chairman. \u201cWe\u2019re basically leaving no stone unturned.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. Al Green also called for the impeachment of Trump in May He argued Trump should be impeached for his rhetoric against certain groups A resolution to start the process of impeaching President Donald Trump was tabled Wednesday, following a push from Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas to force such a vote on the House floor. The vote was 364-58 and was not directly on the resolution, rather a vote to table the proposal. The move to impeach was not supported by Democratic leaders, who have pushed aside the idea of impeaching the President. \u201cI love my country,\u201d Green wrote in a letter to his colleagues Tuesday. \u201cFor this reason, I will bring articles of impeachment to a vote in the House of Representatives.\u201d The vote happened under a process where lawmakers in the House can offer \u201cprivileged\u201d motions on impeachment, which means they can force the House floor to consider the subject. Green argued that Trump should be impeached for his rhetoric against certain racial and ethnic groups in the US, including Latinos, Muslims and African-Americans. Fight over liberal push for impeachment divides House Democrats Trump\u2019s rhetoric, while not criminal, still \u201cdivides and damages the social fabric of our country in ways that obstruction of justice cannot,\u201d Green wrote in his letter. He said that the founders wanted a way to be able to remove a President who was \u201ccausing harm to society,\u201d adding that impeachment \u201cwas designed for a time such as this and a President such as Trump.\u201d White House spokesman Raj Shah called Green\u2019s effort \u201cdisappointing\u201d in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that extremists in Congress still refuse to accept the President\u2019s decisive victory in last year\u2019s election,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cTheir time would be better spent focusing on tax relief for American families and businesses, and working to fund our troops and veterans through the holiday season rather than threaten a government shutdown.\u201d Top Democratic leaders repeatedly urged Green to refrain from bringing this up on the floor, arguing this is not the time to push impeachment. A senior House Democratic leadership aide told CNN that \u201cPelosi and Hoyer will vote to table,\u201d referencing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber. The aide added, \u201cThey\u2019ve been clear and consistent that now is not the time for this vote and we should be giving time for (special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation) to play out. \u201c In May, Green called for the impeachment of Trump, making him the first member of Congress at the time to officially request leveling charges against the President from the House floor. This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump insulted his way to the White House. His run to the Republican nomination was defined by his bullying of rivals \u2013 from \u201cLow Energy\u201d Jeb Bush to \u201cLyin\u2019 \u201d Ted Cruz.  Trump spent the general election doing much of the same with \u201cCrooked\u201d Hillary Clinton, insisting that she lacked the stamina and brainpower to be president. Voters \u2013 or enough of them in the right states \u2013 saw Trump\u2019s name-calling and insults as toughness. Or a rejection of politics as usual. Or just plain funny. He won. And, despite pledges to be so presidential we would all be bored, Trump has turned from an insult-driven candidate to an insult-driven president. The latest example came Monday afternoon during an event honoring Navajo code talkers. What would Andrew Jackson think of Donald Trump? \u201cI just want to thank you because you are very, very special people,\u201d Trump told the gathered group. \u201cYou were here long before any of us were here. Although, we have a representative in Congress who has been here a long time \u2026 longer than you \u2013 they call her Pocahontas!\u201d (Trump referred to his nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 a label he has long used for the Massachusetts Democrat \u2013 while standing in front of a portrait of President Andrew Jackson, his political idol, who instituted a policy of \u201cIndian removal\u201d from a handful of states \u2013 a forced exodus known as the \u201cTrail of Tears.\u201d) Pocahontas was a historical character from the 17th century, and many Native Americans say that using her name in a disparaging way insults native peoples and degrades their cultures. Trump\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d went over like a lead balloon in the room. The pool report described the reaction this way: \u201c(Awkward silence in room.)\u201d  You can watch it for yourself here. Here\u2019s how one of the honorees reacted. (GIF courtesy of CNN\u2019s Brenna Williams.) The simple and irrefutable fact here is that Trump, since the moment he became a candidate, has not simply rewritten the rules of how someone running for president \u2013 or elected president \u2013 acts. He has made political hay out of flouting these rules \u2013 dismissing them as musty relics of politics as usual. Anyone who blanches at his insults or suggests that he is defining the presidency downward just doesn\u2019t get it (or him). In Trump\u2019s own mind, all he is doing is freaking out the squares. Insults, of course, are not policies. And bullying is not a strategy. Trump either doesn\u2019t understand that, doesn\u2019t care or is simply incapable of moving beyond a political philosophy that would be recognizable to any grade school bully. He called Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 a reference to the fact that she has claimed Native American heritage \u2013 because a) he thought it would be funny and b) he knows his base eats up these insults. That using that word, which some Native Americans consider a racial slur, in the context of an event honoring code talkers \u2013 or in front of a painting of Jackson \u2013 might offend someone might well have not even occurred to Trump. And, if it did, he likely did it anyway as a way to attack the so-called \u201csnowflake\u201d culture on the left. When White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about the moment in her daily press conference, she argued the word \u201cPocahontas\u201d was not a slur and quickly sought to change the subject to Warren: \u201cWhat most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career.\u201d Look. There\u2019s no question that Trump\u2019s base, when they hear about this kerfuffle, will laugh at the reference and revel in the fact that the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d media made a big deal out of it. That\u2019s fine. But just because you laugh at bullying or cast rank incivility as a rejection of an overbearing political correctness culture doesn\u2019t make it \u2013 or you \u2013 right. There are lots and lots of ways that Trump\u2019s candidacy and presidency have changed, are changing and will change not just our politics but also our culture. Perhaps the most damaging is that his obsession with insults and feuds sends a message that name-calling and bullying are just fine as long as you are doing it to \u201cpeople who deserve it.\u201d That is the sort of genie that is impossible to put back in its bottle even after Trump leaves office. The mainstreaming of incivility and insults will have an impact long after Trump leaves the White House.",

            "article_content": "Hate crimes in the United States have increased to a point not seen in recent history, according to a new statistical report released Monday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thousands of hate crimes \u2013 6,121 \u2013 were reported to the FBI in 2016, the report found. That\u2019s up from 5,850 reported hate crime incidents in 2015. The figures are based on over 1,500 incident reports from law enforcement agencies around the country. Other than the increase in 2016, the number of hate crimes found each year by the FBI has decreased since the agency started collecting data in 1992. There were 8,759 hate crimes reported by the FBI in 1996, for instance, although more police departments took part in that survey. The rise in 2016 reported by the FBI comes after observers have pointed to an increase in hate crimes and conversations about racial animus and hate speech have been central to political conversations nationwide. The FBI\u2019s report puts more statistical weight behind the argument that the 2016 election coincided with an increase in hate crimes, including by those purporting to be supporters of President Donald Trump. In the days after the November 2016 election, an increase in racist slogans and hateful messages was reported, especially in schools. The Southern Poverty Law Center found 867 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the 10 days after the Nov. 8 election. After coming under criticism for not speaking out, Trump responded by saying he was \u201cso saddened\u201d to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. \u201cIf it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,\u201d Trump told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last year shortly after Election Day. Trump was criticized again this summer as slow to respond to a violent gathering by white nationalists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia. Researchers and advocates studying civil rights and hate crimes say the findings are just a small window into a much bigger problem. \u201cThose figures from the FBI don\u2019t represent the universe of hate crimes,\u201d said Sim Singh, national advocacy manager for the Sikh Coalition.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely it represents the tip of the iceberg.\u201d Shortcomings in the data are inevitable given that the FBI relies on voluntary participation by law enforcement, says Singh. This year, only about 11% of law enforcement agencies participating in the program submitted hate crime data for the report. The FBI publishes its hate crime statistics based on the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. The UCR is routinely criticized for undercounting crimes. But Ken Schwencke, a reporter for ProPublica who is investigating gaps in hate crime data, says  the incomplete data the FBI provides is useful for getting an understanding of trends. \u201cOne thing you can see in the data is these big swings during real life events,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 9/11, there was a surge in reports of anti-Muslim violence.\u201d What\u2019s lost, he says, is any kind of detail about the magnitude of the problem or where it is problematic. Schwencke explained some of the reasons the report is inadequate. Many victims do not report the crimes and even if they do, police departments often apply different criteria for tracking and reporting the crimes internally and to the FBI. In some cases, the largest departments in the country have failed to report cases that his organization has validated as hate crimes. That\u2019s made the FBI report an incomplete and piecemeal study of the phenomenon, he said. ProPublica is working with hundreds of local news organizations to verify reports of hate crimes in order to create a national database. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, an agency within the Department of Justice, conducts surveys that shed some light on how many hate crimes happen. The agency found an average of 250,000 hate crime victimizations per year from 2004 to 2015. The Bureau of Justice Statistics compiled its numbers from the National Crime Victimization Survey, a large survey of households in the US. Past research by the Anti-Defamation League found that at least 85 police agencies in cities with populations over 100,000 did not participate in the FBI\u2019s annual report on hate crimes. For context, a 2010 Census report found that 285 cities have populations of at least 100,000.

Terry McAuliffe suggests special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation could reveal a stark conclusion: treason. \u201cI mean the bottom line, the crux of this entire issue, is that people were working with a foreign government who you know is not working in our best interests to destabilize our elections and to destabilize our country,\u201d McAuliffe told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. \u201cIf we find that any US citizen was involved in this, it\u2019s treason,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where it goes,\u201d the Virginia Democrat said of Mueller\u2019s indictments of Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos this week. Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty. McAuliffe said he thinks someone with knowledge of the US election \u201chad to give (the Russians) a roadmap of who to talk to, what names to put on memos and things.\u201d And while he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s evidence yet of treason, he does think the impact of the Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign is apparent. \u201cLook at the destabilization in our country today that\u2019s been wrought because of this,\u201d McAullffe said. \u201cYou know we\u2019ve got issues with NATO today. Look at the issues going on with North Korea.\u201d \u201cThis is just the beginning, I think, of a long series of things that are about to come,\u201d he said of Mueller\u2019s investigation. The Trump factor dominates the final week of Virginia's governor's race Looking ahead to next week\u2019s election for his gubernatorial successor, McAuliffe said that he believes the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, is running with the \u201cTrump playbook.\u201d \u201cPeople are happy with our economy and Ed can\u2019t run on that so he\u2019s got to take the Trump playbook and divide people,\u201d McAuliffe said. The current Virginia governor took particular issue with Gillespie\u2019s attack ads, which warn of the MS-13 gang and sanctuary cities (which McAuliffe notes do not exist in Virginia) and tout the preservation of Confederate monuments. Some Democrats have accused Gillespie of using the ads to stoke racial fears \u2013 an accusation with which McAuliffe agrees. \u201cThis is not the Ed Gillespie I knew, but the Ed Gillespie (in) this campaign is racist, bigoted, hurtful,\u201d he told Axelrod. \u201cAs a candidate, you own your ads. Plain and simple.\u201d Asked whether he harbors any aspirations of seeking the highest political office \u2013 the presidency \u2013 when he ends his term next year, McAuliffe said he has \u201cno idea\u201d what he\u2019ll be doing in 2020. He noted he plans to travel to support Democratic gubernatorial candidates, saying his focus is squarely on the 2018 races. \u201cIt drives me wild when Democrats talk about 2020. Because if we don\u2019t have a successful night in 2018, and we\u2019re going to get redistricted \u2026 our party and the principles we care about are going to get wiped out,\u201d he said. However, when pressed about whether he would rule out a run, McAuliffe said he\u2019d \u201cnever rule anything out.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see where life takes you,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Jimmy Carter says he is available if Trump needs him Kim Jong Un is scarier than his father, he says President Donald Trump may have found an unlikely ally in the presidents\u2019 club. In an interview with The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, former President Jimmy Carter said he\u2019s eager to partner with Trump for a North Korea diplomatic mission. While his comments about his North Korea plan were brief, the former Democratic commander in chief addressed several topics, including the Trump-Putin relationship and his disappointment of Obama\u2019s work in the Middle East. Here are the 5 most remarkable lines from Carter\u2019s interview. Carter told the Times he\u2019s willing to go to North Korea amid the ongoing tensions over nuclear weapons. \u201cI would go, yes,\u201d he said. He said he has talked with Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, about his intentions but was given \u201ca negative response.\u201d \u201cI told him that I was available if they ever need me,\u201d he said. US preparing for North Korea's 'final step' It would not be the first time Carter collaborates with a president or travels to North Korea in a diplomatic mission. In 2010, he negotiated the release of an imprisoned US citizen. Carter also helped defuse the first North Korean nuclear crisis, paving the way for a 1994 deal in which North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons in return for aid. The deal fell apart a few years later when the George W. Bush administration accused Pyongyang of a secret atomic arms program. The 93-year-old former leader said Kim Jong Un makes him more nervous than his father, the late Kim Jong-il.  Why? \u201cI think he\u2019s now got advanced nuclear weaponry,\u201d he said. North Korea's missile tests When it comes to sports players and the national anthem, Carter was adamant. \u201cI think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate,\u201d he said. \u201d I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem.\u201d Colin Kaepernick started protesting racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem. After Trump attacked players who kneel, some NFL players responded by continuing to kneel Carter criticized several of President Barack Obama\u2019s actions on foreign policy. The former president said Obama \u201crefused to talk to North Korea more\u201d and lamented the US drone attacks in Yemen, according to Dowd. \u201cHe made some very wonderful statements, in my opinion, when he first got in office, and then he reneged on that,\u201d he said about Obama\u2019s action on the Middle East. It appears that Carter defended Trump a few times during the interview. Carter said Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t bother him. \u201cAt the Carter Center,\u201d he told the Times, \u201cwe deal with Putin and the Russians quite frequently concerning Syria.\u201d He praised Trump for taking the initiative to reach out to Saudi Arabia and said the President has been under a stricter spotlight than his predecessors. \u201cI think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I\u2019ve known about,\u201d Carter replied. \u201cI think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.\u201d But he said that Trump was deepening racial divisions in the US. \u201cYes, I think he is exacerbating it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe not deliberately.\u201d Carter also told the newspaper that he and his wife, Rosalynn, did not vote for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary elections. \u201cWe voted for Sanders,\u201d he said. His revelation that both Carters voted for Sanders came after he was asked whether Russians stole the election from Hillary Clinton. Carter said he and his wife disagreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes,\u201d he told the Times. Carter said in May that Sanders was his 2016 Democratic primary choice, telling an audience at the Carter Center during a discussion with Sanders, \u201cCan y\u2019all see why I voted for him?\u201d",

            "article_content": "There are now effectively two Republican parties Trump's showdown with Corker will go a long way to deciding the state of the GOP The clash between President Donald Trump and Bob Corker doesn\u2019t just match a political wrecking ball against a civilized archetype of elite Republicanism. It goes a long way to explain the tussle raging within the GOP itself \u2013 over the party\u2019s approach to validating its Washington majority, its responsibility for global stewardship and its prospects in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump reignited the clash Tuesday, saying on Twitter that \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker\u201d had been made to \u201csound a fool\u201d in an interview recorded by The New York Times. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am dealing with,\u201d he wrote. As the President and foreign relations committee chairman wage their war of words, they are highlighting, and testing, lessons of last year\u2019s riotous election forged in the heat of a party civil war that has only grown more intense. The first is that there are now effectively two Republican parties \u2013 one dominated by Trump and his uber-loyal followers, for whom his feud with Corker represents exactly the kind of disruption they hoped to see him unleash. The other GOP, meanwhile, is made up of establishment, orthodox conservatives like the Tennessee senator and his Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who want to use their power to legislate and fret about Trump\u2019s global leadership. The second rule of last year\u2019s Republican primary circus is one that Corker is now daring to confound \u2013 namely that no one who gets down in the muck with a brutal political street-fighter like Trump comes out clean or unscathed. Trump\u2019s showdown with Corker, which went nuclear over the weekend, will go a long way to deciding the state of the GOP as it musters for midterm elections next year \u2013 at which its monopoly in Washington will be on the line. It could also show whether Trump\u2019s go-to tactic of waging war on the Republican Party establishment, that has proven so profitable in the past, is a viable strategy going forward or whether it is ultimately self-defeating. Trump briefly toed the party line in backing Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in his losing primary race against Roy Moore last month \u2013 but even before voters went to the polls, he admitted he might have done the wrong thing. In many ways, the Corker vs. Trump prizefight is familiar: it\u2019s a reprise of the classic showdown between the populist, nationalist President and a GOP grandee devoted to conservative rule at home and internationalism abroad. \u201cThere is a lot going on in the Republican Party,\u201d Andre Bauer, a former lieutenant governor of South Carolina, told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin Monday. \u201cYou have an establishment class senator in Bob Corker that has always held himself above the fray, conducted himself (as) most Republicans think a Republican senator should act like.\u201d \u201cBut Donald Trump challenged the Republican establishment \u2013 there are a lot of Republicans like me that quite frankly were sick of the same old, same old \u2026 he has continued to fight the system,\u201d Bauer added. There have been signs that if Trump fails to secure results on Capitol Hill, he could effectively become the first sitting Republican president to run against a do-nothing Congress of his own party in the midterms, perhaps by backing insurgent GOPers in primary races against establishment lawmakers. And from the party\u2019s grassroots, Corker\u2019s intervention may seem less consequential than it did in Washington, which was transfixed by the spat that culminated when the senator warned Trump\u2019s volatile temperament could put the US on the path to \u201cWorld War III.\u201d Some Washington pundits and media commentators praised Corker for having the courage to finally stand up to Trump, for voicing what many GOP figures say privately and for no longer appeasing what they see as the President\u2019s dangerous approach to crises like the standoff with North Korea. But outside Washington, things often appear differently. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, for instance, told his listeners on Monday that Corker was part of a cabal of Washington Republicans who wanted to \u201cnullify\u201d Trump and preserve the \u201ccurrent world order.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that Trump was channeling frustration against the Washington GOP\u2019s struggles to implement his agenda. \u201c\u2018We sent you there, we gave you the White House, the Senate, we want to see these things get done,\u2019\u201d she said, voicing complaints she had heard at town hall meetings. CNN\u2019s White House team reported Monday that Trump was not yet done with the controversy. Sources said the President believed that other senators may be loath to criticize him, since unlike Corker, who has announced he will retire after the midterm elections, they may fear the wrath of his loyalists in primaries. Texas Republican consultant Bill Miller described the reaction to Trump\u2019s latest antics in the Lone Star State as \u201ceye-rolling\u201d compared to the \u201chead-exploding\u201d reactions taking place in Washington. But he also challenged the perception that the President\u2019s behavior would always be accepted by grassroots Republican voters. \u201cThis is what he does, it is a trick to do this. It works less effectively every successive time. What I believe is happening even down here in Texas, which is very conservative, is that there is a sense of a behavioral issue \u2026 it is impolitic,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not smart. It\u2019s counterproductive, it isn\u2019t producing any kind of result you want. If your goal is to blow things up, destroy, great, but that is not a good first-term record.\u201d Trump has a history of taking on GOP establishment figures and crushing them, starting with the presidential primary race. When elite opponents like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio tried to slug out a bare-knuckle fight with him, they limped away with their political reputations wounded. But in Washington, the President\u2019s record for knockouts has been less effective. Trump\u2019s unpredictable ways and tendency to turn upon Republicans has contributed to his struggle to secure a major legislative win. His efforts to help repeal Obamacare, for instance, often seemed ill-informed or counterproductive. And when Republican Sen. John McCain stood up to Trump\u2019s power and helped derail a last ditch bid to repeal Obamacare, he polished his own legacy \u2013 at least in Washington \u2013 and won sympathy when the President attacked him shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis. On Monday, many Beltway strategists and senior Republicans were left shaking their heads, warning that Trump\u2019s reflexive lashing out could cost him the crucial vote of Corker as he seeks a year-end legislative victory. \u201cGoing after a senator whose vote you need on tax reform is not the best strategy,\u201d Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy said on CNN. But there were also signs on Monday that Washington\u2019s GOP divides may be bridgeable, as another Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has often clashed with the President, took to the links alongside him. President Trump, Lindsey Graham hit the links at Trump's Virginia course Unusually, the White House allowed cameras to record Trump on the golf course, sending a message that Corker\u2019s revolt was not uniform among GOP senators. Less than two months ago, Graham was castigating the President over his sluggish condemnation of white supremacists after racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, warning \u201chistory is watching us all.\u201d On Monday, after a round at Trump\u2019s club in Virginia, Graham praised him for a performance worthy of a golf pro, shrewdly identifying the way to his host\u2019s heart. \u201cPresident Trump shot a 73 in windy and wet conditions!\u201d Graham tweeted.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday night, Randall Woodfin scored an upset of the two-term Democratic mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, to become the youngest mayor (he\u2019s 36) in the Magic City in more than 100 years. Woodfin\u2019s campaign became something of a cause celebre among national liberal activists aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Nina Turner, the head of Our Revolution, the organization Sanders formed post-2016, was an active presence for Woodfin in the race. Sanders recorded a robo-call that went out Monday saying that Woodfin would fight for racial justice, sanctuary city status for Birmingham and his own \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, and sent out a tweet urging people to go to the polls and one congratulating Woodfin on his victory. Interestingly, Woodfin was a Hillary Clinton supporter during the 2016 campaign, serving as her state director in Alabama. To learn more about Woodfin and the role the Sanders brigade played in his victory, I reached out to Erin Edgemon, who covered the race for the Birmingham News. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: How unexpected (or not) was Woodfin\u2019s win? Edgemon: Woodfin\u2019s campaign had a lot of momentum leading up to Tuesday\u2019s runoff, making his eventual win less surprising than it was six weeks ago at the primary election. Social media was abuzz with Woodfin supporters. Woodfin, who had only served one term on the city school board, received hundreds of donations from across the country. His progressive campaign became a focus of national media. We knew Tuesday\u2019s turnout would tell us a lot, even before results began to trickle in that night. It appeared turnout would be low, lower than the general election, which only attracted 26% of registered voters. Turnout came in, though, at 35%. Cillizza: Bernie Sanders and other national liberals are claiming this as a big victory for them. Is it? Edgemon: Woodfin\u2019s win wasn\u2019t a big victory for Bernie Sanders, but more a reflection of Birmingham voters wanting a change from long-time politicians. Our Revolution\u2019s involvement did likely bring more young voters to the polls, though. There\u2019s often a misconception of Birmingham on the national level. Birmingham is a more progressive city that cares about human rights. Cillizza: How much influence did local factors have on all of this? Edgemon: Birmingham voters said loud and clear on Tuesday night that they want change. It didn\u2019t matter that the incumbent during his seven-year tenure revitalized downtown, spearheaded the building of a minor league baseball stadium and an award-winning park (which) led to the building of thousands of new apartments and upscale restaurants. The race was all about local factors. Woodfin spent a year knocking on doors in every neighborhood in the city; there are 99 of them. Every Woodfin supporter I spoke to said the same thing: The city\u2019s neighborhoods need attention. They need basic services like street paving and abandoned houses demolished. And they want to feel safer in their homes. Cillizza: Explain the significance of Woodfin\u2019s win for Birmingham and Alabama more generally. Edgemon: In terms of Alabama politics, Woodfin\u2019s win isn\u2019t very significant. For decades, Birmingham has been the blue city in a red state. At 36, Woodfin is one of the youngest politicians in the state so it will be interesting to see what impact, if any, that will have on state politics. The win isn\u2019t likely to change Alabama\u2019s red political landscape \u2013 where ultra-conservative and biblical Roy Moore is aiming to win election to Alabama\u2019s Senate. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: In 10 years, Randall Woodfin will be ____________.\u201d Now, explain. Edgemon: \u201cOn to bigger things.\u201d If you ask Woodfin, he would say he will be out of an elected office in 10 years. He said he believes in cultivating young talent. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, though, if he sets his sights on a state or even national office.",

            "article_content": "Justices heard challenge to Wisconsin districts Democrats say were drawn to benefit GOP Roberts expressed concern about the court's image if it appears too partisan During heated Supreme Court arguments Tuesday over whether the justices should take up challenges to politically gerrymandered voting districts, Chief Justice John Roberts confessed what matters to him. It comes down to how things look and what people think. What would the public think, he asked, if the justices began hearing challenges to partisan gerrymandering and ruled for Democrats, or conversely, Republicans? Anthony Kennedy doesn't tip hand in gerrymandering case \u201cIf you\u2019re the intelligent man on the street,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cand the court issues a decision, and let\u2019s say the Democrats win, and \u2026 that person will say, \u2018Well, why did the Democrats win? \u2026 It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd that,\u201d the chief justice asserted, \u201cis going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the county.\u201d During an hour of arguments over redistricting and voting rights in a case that could have a dramatic political impact for elections nationwide, Roberts put special emphasis on how the court itself would be regarded if it began scrutinizing state legislators and their voting districts. In public speeches, Roberts consistently insists that the justices \u2013 five Republican-appointed conservatives and four Democratic-appointed liberals \u2013 are not political players. But his remarks in the middle of an intense hearing over gerrymandered districts in Wisconsin offered the sharpest statement to date of his thinking \u2013 and perhaps motivations \u2013 regarding the institution that informally bears his name. It is questionable how effective he might be, in these highly polarized times and with the Roberts Court\u2019s own record of 5-to-4 votes in politically incendiary cases. His concern about the \u201ccourt in the eyes of the country\u201d may fall on deaf ears outside the marble columned building, and possibly even within. Here are the most obscenely gerrymandered congressional districts in America His remarks suggest, in fact, that he might in upcoming months continue to distance himself from newest Justice Neil Gorsuch, who, since his April confirmation, has not shied from flashing his conservatism in written opinions and off-bench activities. A threshold question in Tuesday\u2019s dispute over a 2011 Wisconsin redistricting plan that a lower court deemed an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander is whether federal judges should even review partisan claims arising from the inherently political process. Democratic state challengers say the sophisticated computer and data analytics used by the Republican majority in the state capitol gave the GOP a disproportionate advantage and diluted Democratic electoral influence throughout the state. Challengers say the partisan gerrymander was so extreme that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment equality guarantee and First Amendment rights related to party affiliation and views. State officials said they relied on traditional redistricting principles and contend that courts should stay out of the politically charged map-drawing that follows each 10-year census. The justices\u2019 comments from the bench suggest they would be tightly divided, with swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy poised to cast the crucial vote. Kennedy appeared open to First Amendment arguments related to the harm to voters distributed throughout districts based on political views. The four liberal justices \u2013 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 appeared ready to allow legal challenges to gerrymanders that disproportionately favor one party over another. The three justices on the far right, Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, seemed ready to block such lawsuits. Chief Justice Roberts fell in with the latter group but partly for reasons related to the court\u2019s public image that only he voiced. A 2005 appointee of GOP President George W. Bush, Roberts has voted along conservative lines. He opposed a constitutional right to gay marriage, for example, and has voted against affirmative action and other racial remedies. In 2012, however, he surprised some observers when he cast the deciding vote to uphold President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. He was blasted by many Republicans, including New York businessman Donald Trump, then four years from his presidential bid. Political complaints about the court have ramped up as Washington has become increasingly politicized. Roberts tells audiences that the court is above such politics. \u201cWe in the judiciary do not do our business in a partisan, ideological manner,\u201d he said at an appearance earlier this year. During arguments in Gill v. Whitford on Tuesday, he described perceptions about the court\u2019s role as his \u201cmain problem\u201d in the case. \u201cIf the claim is allowed to proceed, there will naturally be a lot of these claims raised around the country,\u201d Roberts told lawyer Paul Smith, arguing on behalf of the challengers. \u201cAnd every one of them will come here for a decision on the merits. \u2026 We will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win.\u201d Roberts scoffed at the idea that people would believe the court relied on the challengers\u2019 proposed formula tied to \u201cpartisan asymmetry\u201d in Democratic and Republican election results. \u201cThe intelligent man on the street is going to say that\u2019s a bunch of baloney,\u201d Roberts said. And, for the court, he added, such a dilemma would recur \u201cas these cases are brought in every state.\u201d Smith said the risk would be greater if the court fails to become involved. \u201cIt may be that you can protect the court from seeming political,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the country is going to lose faith in democracy big time because voters are going to be like \u2026 voters in Wisconsin (saying) \u2026 \u2018It really doesn\u2019t matter whether I vote.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court hears case on political gerrymandering Tuesday Democrats are the majority party in just 31 of the nation's 98 partisan state legislative chambers Democrats have launched groups, funded legal battles and thrown money at state parties in an effort to keep the disastrous redistricting of 2010 that all but guaranteed a Republican-controlled House for the next decade from happening again. Now, they are putting their hopes in the Supreme Court, which will hear a case Tuesday that was originally brought by Wisconsin Democrats who complain that the legislative maps in their state were unconstitutionally drawn to benefit Republicans. Democrats hope that the nation\u2019s high court will set guidelines that would bar an overreliance on politics in the map-making process. Such a ruling could fundamentally shift American politics \u2013 particularly for Democrats, whose urban and minority voters tend to live in clusters that make it easier to drawn them into the same districts. The stakes are high: Right now, Democrats are the majority party in just 31 of the nation\u2019s 98 partisan state legislative chambers. If the Supreme Court sets guidelines to prohibit partisanship from being used to draw district lines, it would put \u201c10 to 12 more chambers in immediate play\u201d in six or seven states, said Jessica Post, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Winning control of those state-level chambers means Democrats would also play a role in drawing congressional maps there. \u201cWe still have a shot on the current map, but if we have fair maps, we could see real progress,\u201d Post said. The Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, is the first of several legal battles working through the courts right now that Democrats hope will curb partisan and racial gerrymandering. Ongoing battles in North Carolina, Texas and Virginia are focused on race. On Tuesday, the Eric Holder-led National Democratic Redistricting Committee, launched in the wake of 2016\u2019s election, is expected to file a lawsuit on behalf of residents of Georgia over legislative maps that lawmakers there redrew in 2015 to shore up the Atlanta suburbs for Republican incumbents. \u201cAs Democrats and grassroots activists refocus their efforts on state and local elections, one thing is abundantly clear: if we want to fix our broken political system, we need to start by fixing the way we draw electoral maps. That fight starts now,\u201d Holder said. The court battles are at the forefront of Democrats\u2019 bid to win back the nearly 1,000 state legislative seats the party lost during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 a blow that Obama himself is now attempting to help reverse by raising money for the redistricting group. The heightened Democratic focus on state legislatures will be tested this fall in Virginia, where the party will try to chip away at the GOP\u2019s nearly 2-to-1 state assembly majority, and Nevada, where Republicans are pushing to recall several sitting Democrats in a bid to change party control of the state Senate. The Nevada effort is particularly concerning to national Democrats who fret that the GOP could use similar tactics in other states. In addition to its regular monthly $10,000 contributions to each state party, the DNC sent a six-figure sum and the Holder-led group sent $50,000 to the new group Our Votes, Our Voice, which is leading a campaign urging voters to decline to sign the recall petitions. Donors are also paying closer attention to the state-level battles. Post said the DLCC\u2019s online fundraising is up 450% compared to this point in 2015, while a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association said the group is receiving contributions this year from major donors who previously have ignored or only contributed small amounts to state races. Buoying Democrats as they attempt to refocus the party\u2019s donors and activists on down-ballot races is that \u2013 while whiffing in congressional special elections \u2013 Democrats have flipped eight state legislative seats this year. \u201cRepublicans have worked for years to rig the system with partisan gerrymandering and restrictive voting laws designed to keep African Americans, Latinos, and young people away on Election Day,\u201d said Tom Perez, the DNC chairman. \u201cDemocrats believe that voters should get to choose their representatives, not the other way around,\u201d Perez said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe believe that America is stronger when more people, not fewer, participate on Election Day. And as Republicans try to silence people\u2019s voices and limit one of our most fundamental rights, Democrats will continue fighting for the equal voice every voter deserves.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the span of seventy-two hours, President Donald Trump has fumed and fired a health chief with a penchant for taxpayer-funded private jets, bragged about a recovery process in Puerto Rico that bears little resemblance to reality on the ground, lashed the mayor of the island\u2019s capital city for questioning the federal response, and viewed a golf tournament from the \u201ccommissioner\u2019s suite\u201d at a country club that costs $500,000 to join. The whiplash weekend just past the eight-month mark of Trump\u2019s presidency reflects an administration still dictated by the personal whims of the President, who aides and friends describe as continually agitated by a series of unfulfilled campaign promises and convinced the counsel from his hired hands has steered him woefully off course. As Trump settled into another weekend at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, the questions about his competence as leader grew louder. Widespread suffering on Puerto Rico has been unmatched by the rhetoric coming from the White House, where the recovery effort is described in far rosier terms. Questions about Trump\u2019s leadership are not new, but the unmet needs of Puerto Rico \u2014 the majority of the island is without power, while drinking water and fuel remain scarce \u2014 have placed his shirking of presidential norms into sharper relief than ever. Trump, watching cable news coverage of the devastated island, has grown progressively more angry at depictions of a botched federal response, which he believes contradict the accounts of  coordination and aid delivery that have been included in his regular briefings. Over the weekend, he aimed his frustration at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, \u201cSuch poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,\u201d Trump tweeted in part. \u201cThey want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\u201d The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump. ...Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They.... ...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job. The mayor, in turn, insisted in an interview with CNN that she would not be distracted by \u201csmall comments, by politics, by petty issues. This is one goal, and it is to save lives.\u201d A day later, the fallout was apparent on the Sunday morning talk shows. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate,\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has frequently criticized Trump, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI mean, when people are in the middle of a disaster, you don\u2019t start trying to criticize them. I don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s just not the way that I think it ought to be handled.\u201d \u201cYou just don\u2019t get into who\u2019s bad or who\u2019s good, no matter what they say,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cYou have to ignore it. You got to be bigger than the nonsense.\u201d The online argument was perhaps not unexpected, since the President has frequently launched angry Twitter tirades on Saturday mornings from his private clubs. Last weekend, Trump consulted his coterie of aides about going after National Football League players who have knelt during the national anthem; despite a tepid reaction, he launched into a weekend-long assault on the players anyway. The move, Trump seemed to believe, would appeal to the base of white rural voters who helped fuel his unlikely rise from reality television star to United States President. Polling this week seemed to bear that out: almost 9 in 10 Republicans surveyed by CNN said kneeling during the national anthem is the wrong thing to do. But among that majority, 32% disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to criticize the players. The NFL spat \u2014 which Trump was still prodding on Twitter a week later \u2014 reflected the President\u2019s deep-seated concerns about support from the base of voters who elected him. Trump\u2019s appeal to the white working-class voters who propelled him into office has always been built on an unlikely ability to appear sympathetic to their concerns, a remarkable political feat for a billionaire real-estate developer whose brand was rooted in wealth and indulgence. It was that inclination that drove Trump\u2019s fury this week at Tom Price, his ousted health chief, whose use of taxpayer dollars to fund private air travel undercut Trump\u2019s promise to rid Washington of its excesses. Speaking on Friday, Trump acknowledged that it was the appearance of wasting of taxpayer dollars \u2014 and not necessarily the private jets themselves \u2014 that had so enraged him. \u201cI was disappointed because I didn\u2019t like it, cosmetically or otherwise,\u201d Trump said Friday as he departed the White House for his golf club in New Jersey. \u201cI was disappointed. And you know, this is an administration that saves hundreds of millions of dollars on renegotiating things. So I don\u2019t like to see somebody that perhaps is the perception that it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d The familiar unfolding of a Washington scandal \u2014 revelation, anger, botched clean-up, Friday afternoon firing \u2014 was a glimmer of normalcy for an administration that has been anything but routine. Trump\u2019s quick action reflected his growing concern that voters who elected him into office are losing patience not only with his stalled agenda and dealmaking with Democrats, but also his inability to fundamentally change the entrenched ways of Washington. Inside the White House, Trump\u2019s concerns about losing the support of his base have blanketed much of his decision-making, according to people he\u2019s spoken with. As summer ended without a decisive legislative win, Trump has only grown more insistent on following the volatile \u2013 but, in his view, winning \u2013 political instincts that aides have at times attempted to rein in. Critical upcoming decisions on the Iran nuclear deal and a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman \u2013 both expected to come in mid-October \u2013 are being considered partly for how they\u2019ll play with Trump\u2019s base, people familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said. While Trump begrudgingly agreed to support the establishment-backed candidate in Alabama\u2019s special Senate election, he offered only scant praise during his one campaign event for him. When Sen. Luther Strange lost to far-right Roy Moore in last week\u2019s primary contest, an irritated Trump used the episode to further question the political instincts of his team. Afterward, Trump\u2019s aides shrugged off the loss of the candidate who Trump backed, suggesting instead that Moore\u2019s win was a sign that Trump-style politics is alive and well. \u201cI think that this is an extension of what we saw last year, which is that when some voters have a chance to vote against Washington and the establishment, they will do exactly that, especially after we haven\u2019t had a lot of legislative victories,\u201d said Kellyane Conway, the President\u2019s senior counselor. Trump\u2019s critics say it\u2019s his laser focus on a white political base that\u2019s also driving his combative stance toward Puerto Rico, a US territory that cast ballots in primary contests but does not have an electoral vote. Many have identified racial undertones while comparing his response to Puerto Rico to his widely praised action after hurricanes hit Texas and Florida. An unusually biting commentary on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d underscored the view: \u201cIt\u2019s like when anybody darker than your golf pants has a problem, you\u2019re thinking: How can I make this worse?\u201d said Michael Che, the normally low-key host of \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d The White House insists those claims are without merit, and after the President\u2019s tweets on Saturday, officials scrambled to back up Trump\u2019s claims, painting San Juan mayor Cruz as a showboater who had spent more time on television than coordinating recovery efforts. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair to say that we haven\u2019t done everything we can, because we have done everything that we can and we will continue to do so,\u201d Trump\u2019s budget director Mick Mulvaney said on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the San Juan mayor wants to sort of go against the grain. We would love to have her on team as we all pull the same direction.\u201d By Saturday afternoon, the White House had cobbled together a graphic timeline of the federal response to Puerto Rico, denoting when rescue teams and aid convoys arrived. But if the image was meant to impart evidence of a robust effort, it also underscored the hardships Puerto Ricans still face: Only one hospital on the island is fully operational, the graphic stated, and only half of the dialysis centers are open. For those who don't let the truth get in the way of a good story here's the actual timeline of massive federal response in Puerto Rico-> pic.twitter.com/FnWgpnRy7A The White House, cognizant of Trump appearing to take the weekend off at his golf course, scheduled a series of briefing phone calls from 2 to 3 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. Each one was scheduled to last no longer than15 minutes, however, and one was with a former governor of Puerto Rico who currently works as a lobbyist in Washington. No such calls appeared on Trump\u2019s Sunday schedule; instead, the White House announced that the President would travel by helicopter to the Liberty National Golf Club, perched on New York Harbor, to watch the final day of the President\u2019s Cup golf tournament from a special suite inside the clubhouse. Trump\u2019s three most recent predecessors \u2014 Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton \u2014 took in the tournament together last week, appearing jovial in photographs. They, along with George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, have spearheaded a hurricane charity appeal that includes Puerto Rico; Trump was not invited to participate.",

            "article_content": "Consider the last 72 hours for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The last-ditch attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a promise eight years in the making for Republicans \u2013 failed without even a floor vote. That failure ensures that, for the foreseeable future at least, Obamacare will remain the law of the land. Appointed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, whom both men endorsed, lost badly in a Republican runoff to a candidate backed by Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a McConnell ally and someone Trump urged just 12 days ago to run for a third term, decided against the race \u2013 and, in so doing, created a potential headache for his party in the 2018 midterms. While Trump and McConnell suffered those indignities together, they each also had to deal with humiliations on their own over this three-day span. Trump somehow managed to not only unite the NFL owners and players but also stoke racial tensions with a five-day long attack on professional athletes who protest during the national anthem. While he was distracted by his fight with the NFL, Trump also drew widespread criticism for his day-late-and-dollar-short handling of the devastation cause by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. And, oh yeah, special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia involvement in the 2016 election continued to pick up speed and widen its aperture. For McConnell, he must now grapple with what \u201cSenator Roy Moore\u201d could mean for his already-narrow majority. And deal with skittish incumbents up in 2018 worried that they will become the next Luther Strange. And deal with Trump who, according to CNN\u2019s White House team, is angry at McConnell for allegedly misleading him about Strange\u2019s chances of winning. (That may be the least surprising report of the year.) Then there\u2019s this final indignity: Outlets are reporting that Rick Pitino will be fired by the University of Louisville, McConnell\u2019s alma mater, later today. Welcome to Washington 2017! Consider that Trump and McConnell are, without question, the two most powerful Republicans in a Republican-dominated nation\u2019s capital. This should be the golden age for both men \u2013 a time of unified Republican rule that should allow a series of conservative principles to flower. To date, however, the lone major accomplishment of this Republican dominance is the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. That\u2019s not a small thing but for an administration and a GOP congressional leadership who expected health care reform and tax reform to be done (or almost done) by this point, it\u2019s a major disappointment. And signs point to the road getting harder, not easier for McConnell and Trump. Tax reform, which Trump is expected to preview today in a speech in Indiana, will be no easy thing \u2013 particularly given that a good chunk of the lobbying community in Washington is built around protecting this tax break or that one for a series of ultra-specialized industries. Plus, major \u2013 and complex \u2013 legislation is never as easy to move through Congress as people seem to think. Republicans need only look at their failed efforts on Obamacare to (re)learn that lesson. Bannon will be emboldened by Moore\u2019s victory \u2013 as will the grassroots army he kind-of, sort-of commands. While recreating Alabama won\u2019t be as easy as some think \u2013 Moore had been kicking around Alabama conservative circles for a very long time \u2013 there\u2019s no question that the movement to get rid of people like Roger Wicker (Mississippi) and Dean Heller (Nevada) has more energy today than it did yesterday. Viewed at its most broad, what this week reflects is the relatively limited power of anyone \u2013 up to and including the two leading Republicans in Washington \u2013 to control the GOP right now. While Trump rode the anti-Washington/anti-politician wave to the Republican primary nomination, he neither created it nor is able to command it. (If he was, Strange would have won \u2013 not lost by a bigger margin than in the first vote back in August.) In recent elections, McConnell appeared to have learned how to wrestle the activist party base to the ground following a series of damaging primary losses in 2010 and 2012. But, the rise of Moore \u2013 and McConnell\u2019s unwillingness to spend the conservative firebrand into oblivion \u2013 suggests that the distance between the GOP establishment and its base remains as wide as ever. What\u2019s been made very clear this week is that Trump\u2019s election wasn\u2019t the end of the populist revolt within the GOP. It was only the beginning. And that this revolt doesn\u2019t have a leader to whom everyone in it listens. Or, if there is that leader, it\u2019s Bannon who has publicly warned the party establishment that his ultimate goal is to bring about their total destruction. In short, this horrible week for Washington Republicans may turn out to be the rule, not the exception going forward into 2018.",

How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016 Hip-hop artists have been been raising awareness about police brutality and racial inequality in both music and activism since the 1980s. And Kaepernick, who became one of the most controversial figures in sports when he took a knee last year to protest police brutality, has since been mentioned in tens of lyrics advocating for social justice, including songs by J.

            "article_content": "Trump's words threaten to reshape the football experience Trump's wild weekend all started at an Alabama rally on Friday The biggest question in the NFL this year isn\u2019t who will win Super Bowl 52. It\u2019s what you think of Donald Trump. The President\u2019s decision to use the bully pulpit to start calling political plays from the sidelines has brought the all-Trump, all-the-time mania that has raged through Hollywood, late-night talk shows and the arts roaring into professional sports. It was probably inevitable, given the way he has seized the nation\u2019s psyche since his shock win in last year\u2019s presidential election, that the most powerful man in the world would sooner or later turn his attention \u2013 and his volcanic Twitter feed \u2013 toward America\u2019s most powerful sports league. His decision to do so now threatens not just to embroil the NFL in politics for years to come but to reshape the experience of those who watch it. Wading into the debate about protests by mostly African-American players during pre-game national anthem ceremonies, Trump is exacerbating questions about his own attitude toward race and his apparent determination to keep tugging at the societal and cultural fault lines in American politics. He kept up his end of the controversy Monday morning, comparing on Twitter what he saw as the patriotism of NASCAR to the \u201cdisrespecting\u201d of the US and its flag. But invoking auto racing \u2013 which is especially popular in the conservative south, the epicenter of Trump\u2019s political support \u2013 will do little to quiet the fervor or dispute the suggestion that he is stoking racial tensions. While some of the most prominent players in the NFL and the NBA are black, auto racing has long been viewed as one of the whitest of professional American sports. It's impossible for black athletes to leave politics off the field In years past, on any given Sunday, the NFL has offered moments of rare unity in a nation split by politics, economic disparity and race, when the logo on your jersey was more important than whether you came from red or blue America. The controversy that erupted when Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, first took a knee during the national anthem last season to protest a flag he said oppressed people of color has led the league into treacherous political territory. Now that the President is involved, it\u2019s only going to get more fraught. \u201cThere is no doubt this is one of the biggest sports stories and the biggest cultural stories that we have seen in some years,\u201d said USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d on Sunday. Trump\u2019s attitude did not come out of the blue. While supporters of the take-a-knee protests believe the players are exercising their constitutional rights, the President was speaking for other Americans, many on the right, who see the whole thing as unpatriotic. And his willingness to speak up will strike many of his most loyal supporters as validation for their vote for the most unconventional politician in modern American history last fall. Football is not the first area of national life to experience the turbulence stirred by Trump\u2019s status-quo rattling election victory last year. The President\u2019s unique, politically incorrect style has injected a jolt of resistance into late-night talk shows \u2013 with comedians like Jimmy Kimmel leading a campaign to save Obamacare. Alec Baldwin\u2019s dark take on Trump has meanwhile helped drive the political conversation and returned the glory years to NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In another sign of the disconnect between the former reality show star and the showbiz world that he once courted, Trump is skipping the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in December after top artists threatened a political backlash. Even as he reserved his deepest scorn for the NFL, the President\u2019s capacity to draw everyone within shouting distance into his web of controversy was obvious Sunday as he left the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League with public relations headaches. Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn! The NHL\u2019s Pittsburgh Penguins for instance, found themselves on the end of a Twitter battering from some fans after Trump tweeted that the Stanley Cup winners accepted an invitation to visit him in the White House, hours after he had rescinded an invitation to the NBA champion Golden State Warriors, following criticism from the team\u2019s star player Stephen Curry. Protests also seemed to be spreading to baseball. Trump administration calls for NFL owners to rule on anthem Trump\u2019s wild weekend all started at an Alabama rally on Friday, when he said an NFL owner should fire any \u201cson of a bitch\u201d player who knelt during the national anthem. By Sunday, his comments had changed the way the game is covered. Pre-game shows, normally pulsating with chalk talk, instead probed the political implications of race and protest. Sports politics, once waged by pioneers like Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, but now largely confined to tussles between multi-millionaire players and multi-billionaire owners, suddenly became consumed once more by questions of civil rights, freedom, and what it means to be an American. Throughout the day, the President kept up his own political play-by-play, amazingly calling for a boycott of the league. \u201cIf NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\u201d Trump tweeted. If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend! Trump\u2019s succession of explosive interventions on the NFL was so surreal it even eclipsed the President\u2019s flippant threat to wage nuclear war in North Korea \u2013 against the \u201clittle Rocket Man\u201d Kim Jong Un, in the United States at least. His shots at the NFL appeared to be an attempt to separate the players from team owners and the fans from their Sunday afternoon obsession. Yet, just as his bluster has not stopped Kim\u2019s quest for a nuclear weapon, his outspoken remarks seemed to spark more defiance among NFL players, officials and owners than sympathy. Dozens of players knelt on one knee, or locked arms, as the anthem singers belted out the Star-Spangled banner. Some teams refused to take the field at all for the pre-game ceremonies. Trump\u2019s friend, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, who gave him a Super Bowl ring, meanwhile said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the President\u2019s tone. And the protest even reached Wembley Stadium in London, where the Jacksonville Jaguars were playing the Baltimore Ravens. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, under fire over the league\u2019s handling of domestic violence perpetrated by players and brain injuries, meanwhile seized the chance to capture the moral high ground. But Trump refused to back down. \u201cWell I think the owners should do something about it. I think it\u2019s very disrespectful to our flag and to our county,\u201d Trump said on Sunday evening. His blast at the NFL players came as he waged a separate feud with several top NBA stars. \u201cIt\u2019s not what leaders do,\u201d said Curry. In another remarkable moment, the NBA\u2019s top star LeBron James took to Twitter to brand Trump a \u201cbum.\u201d U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up! For Trump\u2019s critics, his swipes at prominent African-American sports stars is simply a evolution in what they see as a deeply suspect position on race, following his \u201cBirther\u201d crusade against former President Barack Obama and his failure to swiftly condemn white supremacists after violence in Charlottesville. But the President insisted on Sunday that he\u2019s simply standing up for the flag as he voices sentiments that he says are felt deeply by many people, who he says are turned off that football has been entwined with political statements. \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything about race. This has nothing to do with race or anything else. This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday. Critics of the take a knee protests argue that the issue is about the constitutional right to protest but amounts to defaming a flag that has been a poignant rallying point for US service personnel and first responders in the decade-and-a-half of war since 9/11. \u201cThis is not about Republicans or Democrats,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cPlayers have the right for free speech off the field. On the field, this is about respect for lots of people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may not be on the best of terms after a failure to pass a healthcare overhaul this summer and ahead of expected fiscal fights this fall. But they have at least one shared mission: confirming a bevy of federal judges. Their effort, along with today\u2019s relaxed filibuster rules, could give conservatives an opportunity to reshape the federal bench even more than in the 1980s when President Ronald Reagan set a modern standard for maximizing a potential judicial legacy. McConnell\u2019s emerging role reprises his moves last year guaranteeing that the vacancy caused by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was saved for Trump and resulted in recent appointee Neil Gorsuch, a former Colorado-based US Appeals Court Judge. McConnell blocked action in 2016 on President Barack Obama\u2019s choice of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the US Appeals Court in Washington, DC. Democrats slam the end of DACA, while Republicans are mixed A six-term senator from Kentucky, McConnell has continued to steer the stocking of the federal bench in a way that sets him apart from previous Senate majority leaders. He remains a point man for outside conservatives advocating for favored candidates, and he recently won swift confirmation of two Kentuckians for US appeals court judgeships. Senate Democrats and their liberal allies have been scrutinizing the records of Trump\u2019s nominees \u2013 about three dozen to date \u2013 aware that many would fill long-pending vacancies for which Senate Republicans blocked Obama\u2019s nominees. \u201cLet me be clear: Democratic senators are doing their due diligence in reviewing these nominees,\u201d California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in July, adding \u201cThere\u2019s been no obstruction.\u201d She was responding to Republican complaints that Democrats were not moving fast enough in the confirmation process. With their majority in the Senate, Republicans already dominate the process. That majority clout was enhanced in 2013 when the Senate changed its rules to make it more difficult for the minority party to filibuster presidential nominees. Initiated by Democrats who were frustrated at the time by Republican stalling on Obama nominees, it allows a simple majority to cut off protracted Senate debate rather than requiring a supermajority of 60 votes, as was the practice for decades. The rule change did not cover Supreme Court nominees, but Senate Republicans lifted that exemption in April, when Democrats tried to filibuster the Gorsuch nomination. GOP leaders promise fast action on Harvey aid, may tie debt ceiling to must-pass bill So now any judicial nominee can win confirmation with a simple Senate majority. That gives Trump a greater chance to influence the federal bench, including the Supreme Court, than any other president in recent history. Democrats\u2019 countermeasures in this latest chapter of the judicial confirmation wars may emerge in upcoming weeks as the Senate acts \u2013 or holds off \u2013 on pending nominees. Some Democratic senators, frustrated that the White House has not consulted them on candidates from their home states, have signaled that they may take considerable time to assess a nominee or outright refuse to return the custom of what\u2019s known as the \u201cblue slip,\u201d arising from the Senate tradition ensuring the nominations not move forward without the consent of home-state senators. On Tuesday afternoon, Democratic Senator Al Franken announced he would oppose a Trump appeals court nominee from his home state of Minnesota, David Stras, potentially setting up a major battle in the Senate. Some Republicans have urged Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, to move on nominees even when home-state senators do not give a candidate the nod. At a local town hall session in May, Grassley wryly observed that such sentiment against the long-standing \u201cblue slip\u201d courtesy is the opposite of Senate Republicans\u2019 views in 2009 when Democrat Obama had become president and was ready to nominate judges. Federal judges are appointed for life and serve long after a president leaves office, making bench appointments one of the executive\u2019s most lasting legacies. The nine spots of the Supreme Court draw the most attention, but the 179 seats on the federal appeals courts can be nearly as consequential because most cases never make it up to the highest court. (The justices have discretion over what they decide to weigh in on, and resolve only about 70 cases annually.) The full US judiciary is rounded out by 673 positions on the district courts and 9 seats on the Court of International Trade. There currently are 124 vacancies for lifetime positions pending across the judiciary. During his two terms, Reagan appointed about 400 judges, according to figures from the Administrative Office of the US Courts. He named three new Supreme Court justices and elevated Associate Justice William Rehnquist to chief justice. Equally consequential, Reagan made 83 lifetime appointments to the courts of appeals. DACA is revealing Republican schisms on immigration all over again None of the subsequent two-term presidents reached those numbers: Bill Clinton appointed two Supreme Court justices and 66 appeals court judges; George W. Bush appointed two justices and 63 appeals court judges; and Barack Obama appointed two justices and 55 appeals court judges. Enhancing Reagan\u2019s sheer numbers was the impact of the jurists he chose. His legal team searched out young, prominent conservative thinkers, many from academia, who would set a tone for other jurists to limit individual rights and leave societal dilemmas to elected officials. The Reagan judges set the nation on a path of less constitutional protection for women\u2019s reproductive rights and racial affirmative action and overall diminished courts\u2019 involvement in disputes over school desegregation, prison conditions and the environment. Reagan\u2019s Republican successors \u2013 George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush \u2013 to varying degrees, continued that emphasis with their choices. The Trump White House so far appears to be following Reagan\u2019s playbook. Among the early choices for US appeals courts are several who served as law clerks to conservative Justices Scalia or Clarence Thomas and taught in law schools: Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, Allison Eid of Colorado, Joan Larsen of Michigan, and Stras of Minnesota. Eid, Larsen and Stras are currently state court judges. Their nominations are pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee; hearings for Barrett and Larsen are scheduled for Wednesday. Franken made clear on Tuesday that he would try to block any action on Stras\u2019 nomination to the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. He vowed not to return the home-state consent slip that traditionally has been needed to move any court nominee. Franken asserted that Stras would favor \u201cpowerful corporate interests over working people.\u201d Last year Trump had included Stras on his list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. Of the three appeals court nominees who have gained Senate confirmation so far, two are from McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky. The new appointees to the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit are: Amul Thapar, formerly a US district court judge who Trump interviewed for the Supreme Court seat that went to Gorsuch; and John Bush, a Louisville lawyer whose confirmation sparked controversy because he had written hundreds of political blog posts under a pseudonym deriding President Obama, disparaging gay rights and comparing abortion to slavery. During Senate debate in July, Senate Democrats said his blog posts reflected a lack of judgment, as McConnell insisted Bush, who had worked with the senator against campaign finance regulations, would be fair on the bench. September spending deadlines loom as Congress returns In an April floor debate, McConnell said he became captivated by the Senate\u2019s \u201cadvice and consent\u201d power nearly a half century ago when as a Senate staffer he saw two of President Richard Nixon\u2019s Supreme Court nominees voted down in 1969 and 1970. McConnell also referred to his public vow on the night of Scalia\u2019s February 13, 2016 death, that he would block any Obama-nominated successor. \u201cWhen Justice Scalia passed away \u2026 the Senate exercised its constitutional advice-and-consent role by withholding its consent until after the election so the next president, regardless of party, could select the nominee,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a standard that I held to even when it seemed inevitable that our next president would be Hillary Clinton.\u201d McConnell also established an early record of fighting many of Obama\u2019s appeals court nominees. In March 2009, soon after Obama had become president and while Democrats held a majority in the Senate, then-Senate Minority Leader McConnell joined other GOP senators in a letter warning Obama that Republicans would intensely screen his nominees and exercise their home-state interests In the end, Obama won fewer appeals court confirmations than recent two-term presidents and had to wait longer for Senate approval of the nominees who cleared the process. Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Governance Studies Program, who has tracked judicial nominations for decades, said that the median time for Obama appeals court candidates, from nomination to confirmation, was 229 days. During George W. Bush\u2019s tenure, the median was 219 days, during Clinton\u2019s it was 139 days, and during Reagan\u2019s tenure it was 45 days. These days, McConnell and other Republicans are pushing for swift action on nominees, some wanting to toss out the \u201cblue slip\u201d tradition. Grassley acknowledged, with some irony, the switch during that May town hall. \u201cIn March of 2009 all of the Republican senators signed a letter to the Obama administration that we were going to use the blue slip,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got my Republican colleagues \u2026  a lot of them on the right that think we ought to do away with the blue slip.\u201d Update: This story has been updated to include Sen. Franken\u2019s Tuesday announcement. CNN\u2019s Miranda Green contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Local communities almost always pull together on the ground after natural disasters like the torrential flooding that has submerged Houston. But the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey is likely to strain America\u2019s fraying capacity to coalesce as a national community at a moment of heightened political conflict and division. Amid the images of devastation and loss, Americans this weekend repeatedly watched stirring scenes of ordinary people organizing makeshift flotillas to rescue families trapped in the epic flooding. In the rising waters, partisan, racial and class lines all seemed to dissolve. Trump on Harvey funding: 'You're going to see very rapid action' Yet, once the immediate danger has passed, the response to the storm will raise larger political questions on at least two major fronts: the cost of recovery and the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of such devastating storms. Each of those issues will challenge America\u2019s ability to surmount its differences enough to set a shared national direction. Like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy before it, Harvey may demonstrate just how much the man-made gales of political polarization has diminished the nation\u2019s capacity to forge common cause against even the fiercest natural disasters. The first issue that will test the nation\u2019s unity is funding the recovery from the storm. Federal figures put the cost of damages from Katrina in 2005 that devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast at $160 billion, and from Sandy in the New York and New Jersey area in 2012 at around $70 billion. Early estimates on the potential damages from Harvey vary, but experts are anticipating losses totaling tens of billions of dollars. In recent years, Congress has faced unprecedented partisan divides over Washington\u2019s role in meeting those costs. In 2005, Vice President Mike Pence, then a Republican congressman from Indiana, led an effort by House conservatives to offset any post-Katrina aid with offsetting budget cuts in other programs, including highway projects and the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t allow a catastrophe of nature to become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren,\u201d Pence said at the time. Even more partisan \u2013 and regional \u2013 conflict flared after Sandy slammed into New York and New Jersey just before the 2012 presidential election. That storm precipitated a succession of confrontations between conservative Republicans in both chambers against a coalition of Republicans from the region and Democrats. How Harvey compares to other major hurricanes In those debates, Mick Mulvaney, now director of the Office of Management and Budget and then a Republican congressman from South Carolina, echoed Pence during Katrina by proposing legislation to offset Sandy aid with across-the-board reductions in domestic programs. That amendment failed, but over two-thirds of House Republicans voted for it, including an array of prominent Texans still in Congress. That list of supporters included Representatives Kevin Brady (now chair of the House Ways and Means Committee); Jeb Hensarling (now chair of the House Financial Services Committee) and Pete Sessions. Also voting for Mulvaney\u2019s legislation was Paul Ryan, now the House Speaker. Eventually the vast majority of Republicans in both chambers \u2013 179 in the House and 36 in the Senate \u2013 voted against the final $50 billion federal aid package for Sandy, arguing that the bill was bloated with extraneous projects. The Republican opponents included both of Texas\u2019 senators \u2013 John Cornyn and Ted Cruz \u2013 and a lengthy list of Texas House Republicans, including Brady and Hensarling. Trump on Harvey destruction: 'We are one American family' Demanding offsetting cuts complicates responding to natural disasters both at the tactical and philosophical level. The tactical problem is that it ensures a more partisan and protracted Congressional debate. The philosophical problem may be even more telling. Demanding cuts sets the interests of one geographic area against the national web of communities reliant on the programs facing reductions. In essence, demanding that some communities suffer funding losses in ongoing programs to offset assistance to places facing acute needs undermines the core idea that government exists in part to help share risks that individuals, and even individual communities, cannot reasonably bear alone. \u201cSaying, \u2018we will do this for hurricanes in the Gulf Coast or the East Coast or tornadoes in the Midwest or earthquakes in California,\u2019 is a way of saying government as a social institution is there to help society deal with things that at the levels of individuals you can\u2019t reasonably be expected to deal with,\u201d said Richard Kogan, a senior analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a liberal research and advocacy group. These earlier skirmishes raise the question of whether Congressional conservatives, including those from Texas, will again insist on offsetting any aid for Houston and the Gulf Coast with spending cuts elsewhere. Such a move would inevitably extend the Congressional debate over aid and provoke an instant partisan split. No floodwaters could sweep away any sense of shared national concern over the disaster faster than a Congressional debate that frames aid to Texas against programs that benefit communities elsewhere. The nation\u2019s ability to maintain a common purpose will be tested even more severely when the discussion eventually turns to whether climate change is increasing the risk of catastrophic storms like Harvey. Scientists remain leery of attributing any individual storm to climate change. But the dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive. \u201cThere is no doubt that climate change increases the severity of disasters such as Hurricane Harvey,\u201d Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under former President Obama told me in an email exchange Monday.\u00a0\u201cWarmer ocean waters are more conducive to more intense hurricanes (heat = energy).\u00a0Warmer air holds more moisture. Climate change is warming both the ocean and the air. \u00a0In addition, higher sea levels mean greater storm surge.\u00a0As we\u2019re seeing with Harvey, the combination is devastating: powerful winds, incessant downpours, significant flooding.\u00a0\u201d This is Houston. Then and now. In another email exchange on Monday, John W. Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas State climatologist and a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M, was quick to argue that it was premature to directly link Harvey specifically to changes in the climate. \u201cThe climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown; climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it\u2019s not clear whether Harvey was in that category,\u201d he wrote me. But Nielsen-Gammon added that the overall trajectory of extreme weather in Texas is unmistakable-and strongly linked to climate change. \u201cExtreme rainfall, however, is getting heavier: The south-central United States has seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of one-day and two-day extreme rainfall events,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy own analysis of Texas data shows an increase of about 30% in the likelihood of passing a given threshold [of total rain amount] in a given year, which corresponds to about a 5% increase in the intensity of the strongest rainfall over the past century.\u201d That shift, he continued, \u201cis a direct consequence of climate change and is expected to continue.\u201d Like Lubchenco and other climate scientists, Nielsen-Gammon said the increasing incidence of heavy storms is \u201cdriven by rising atmospheric temperatures and rising sea surface temperatures, which affect the capacity of the atmosphere to hold moisture and increases the total amount of water that can rain out when the air is saturated.\u201d Trapped Texas residents face desperate waiting game President Donald Trump has dismissed climate change as a \u201choax\u201d; the Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of uprooting the major regulatory initiatives Obama undertook to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, cars and trucks. Trump also withdrew the US from the Paris global climate accord. In advancing this agenda, Trump has operated with a clear regional tilt, favoring the interests of the states that are most reliant on producing fossil fuels, or consuming them for electricity. That reflects Trump\u2019s electoral base: he won 13 of the 16 states that produce the most natural gas, 16 of the 20 that produce the most oil, and 11 of the 15 that mine meaningful amounts of coal. Yet by prioritizing the immediate interests of these resource-producing states, Trump has slighted the national interest in controlling the risks associated with a changing climate. The irony is that, as Katrina and Harvey have both demonstrated, some of the states most invested in the fossil fuel economy are also at the greatest risk if climate changes spawns more severe storms. \u201cUnfortunately, climate change will most certainly make disasters like Hurricane Harvey more likely:\u00a0 Think of Harvey as a glimpse of the future,\u201d Lubchenco, now a distinguished university professor at Oregon State University, wrote me.\u00a0\u201cThe smart move would be to be better prepared (i.e., to expect this to happen more often, not be surprised by it, and prepare accordingly), to reduce carbon emissions faster than we are now (much faster), and to invest in enhanced research and monitoring that will enable continued improvement of forecasting of events like this.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's daughter is a veteran She's speaking out against the administration's transgender military policy The daughter of a key Trump administration Cabinet member is speaking out against the President\u2019s policy banning transgender people from serving in any capacity in the military. President Donald Trump abruptly announced the new policy in July in a series of tweets, saying the US military \u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u201d Jennifer Detlefsen, the daughter of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, slammed the policy and the President in an expletive-laden Instagram post. \u201cThis man is a disgrace. I\u2019ve tried to keep politics out of my social media feed as much as possible, but this is inexcusable,\u201d said Detlefsen in a caption of a photo quoting the President\u2019s tweets on the subject in late July. A post shared by Jennifer Alexis Hand (@xojenniferalexis) Detlefsen, a Navy veteran like her father, had strong words for the President. \u201cThis veteran says sit down and shut the f*** up, you know-nothing, never-served piece of s***. #itmfa #wtf,\u201d she added. ITMFA stands for \u201cImpeach the mother f***** already.\u201d The post was first reported by the Billings Gazette. On Friday, the White House issued a presidential memorandum with specific directives following through on Trump\u2019s tweets, instructing the military to not move forward with an Obama-era plan that would have allowed transgender individuals to be recruited into the armed forces. The memorandum also bans the Defense Department from using its resources to provide medical treatment regimens for transgender individuals currently serving in the military. The Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Detlefsen declined to be interviewed, however, she did place some distance between her comments and her father. \u201cMy views are my own and not at all related to my father\u2019s position; millions of other people have said the same as I did, and more eloquently,\u201d she said in an email to CNN. \u201cThe thousands of transgender military service members who are under attack by this administration are the ones who should be given a chance to have their voices heard.\u201d Detlefsen is now a Virginia-based glass artist working primarily in the color pink. \u201cI make art about the double standards, taboos and cultural expectations that govern the lives and bodies of women,\u201d she wrote in a biography on her website. She hasn\u2019t been quiet about her political views in the past, posting a photo from her polling place on election day that included the hashtags \u201c#dumptrump,\u201d \u201c#imwithher\u201d and \u201c#vetsagainsttrump.\u201d She participated in the women\u2019s march after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. Detlefsen has received mostly supportive comments on the July post, including many from her fellow service members. But she also responded to those who commented with criticism. \u201cI could have, perhaps should have, used more elegant language. I didn\u2019t because I was \u2013 and am \u2013 angry. But the President himself is lowering the level of discourse in our political climate, so please point that finger elsewhere,\u201d she responded to one user. \u201cI am most certainly not misinformed \u2013 and in fact spent a good deal of time in the service reviewing the medical records of people applying for special forces programs,\u201d she said to another. Reversal of the Obama-era decision to allow transgender troops to serve, she said Monday, was on the \u201cwrong side of history.\u201d \u201cThe military been a giant social engineering experiment since near its inception. From racial integration to opening up career paths to women, decade by decade the military has, by necessity of wanting to recruit and retain the best possible fighting force, been at the vanguard of progressive progress. At each step there have been those who decried the changes- and you know what? They\u2019ve been shown to be on the wrong side of history. Every. Time,\u201d she wrote.

            "article_content": "Warren has increasingly added a focus on racism and cultural issues to her signature economic populism The speeches have stoked speculation that Warren is angling to run for president in 2020 When Republican leaders shut down Elizabeth Warren\u2019s attempt to read Coretta Scott King\u2019s 1986 letter condemning Jeff Sessions on the Senate floor in February, they unknowingly opened a door for the Massachusetts senator to broaden her appeal as a leader in the Democratic resistance to President Donald Trump. In the months since then, Warren has increasingly added a focus on racism and cultural issues to her signature economic populism over several major speeches \u2013 while also developing new relationships with black leaders across the country. Among them is Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. The two spoke by phone, exchanged numbers and then met privately in Atlanta when Warren was in town for a progressive gathering. \u201cIn order for us to make effective change, leaders have to be courageous. They have to be willing to take a stance \u2026 willing to lose some things,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cAnd she was willing to risk some things in this process, being silenced on the floor.\u201d On Monday, Warren will meet King for a second time this month in Atlanta, where she\u2019ll participate in The King Center\u2019s \u201cBeloved Community Talks\u201d event, set for 6 p.m. ET at Ebenezer Baptist Church. The appearance follows a series of speeches in recent months where Warren has emphasized issues of race and culture \u2013 starting when the Rev. Wendell Anthony, the Detroit Branch NAACP president since 1993, saw Warren read King\u2019s letter and invited her to speak at an April dinner attended by thousands. Warren sounded similar notes at a Rainbow PUSH Coalition event in July, and then in front of already adoring progressives at the Netroots Nation meeting in Atlanta this month. The speeches have stoked speculation that Warren is angling to run for president in 2020. And while the Massachusetts senator is careful not to even hint at a run herself, she paused only briefly and smiled as chants of \u201cWarren 2020\u201d rose up during her speech at Netroots Nation. \u201cPeople talk about her in presidential terms often when I travel the country, and I think in the African-American community, it\u2019s because they appreciated that she, in a very full-throated way, will speak to the issue of racism,\u201d said Michael Curry, who chairs the national NAACP\u2019s advocacy and policy committee and was until recently the NAACP Boston chapter president. As Democrats search for new leaders in the Trump era, Warren\u2019s long-held hero status among progressives and economic populists would give her a foothold should she seek the party\u2019s presidential nomination. But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appeals to a similar group of voters. And his 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton was doomed in part by his inability to win older black voters in the South. His failings have left Democratic operatives gaming out the 2020 race with a basic question about Warren: How is a white Harvard law professor who grew up in Oklahoma going to do what Sanders couldn\u2019t? Some black leaders say they see major differences in Sanders\u2019 early 2016 candidacy and Warren today. \u201cWhen Sanders ran, he was very distant and had to learn how to relate to blacks,\u201d said Rev. Jesse Jackson. Warren represents a more diverse state, and \u201cshe does not talk with a strain; she talks with a comfort level and familiarity\u201d in speaking with black leaders, he added. Jackson said he and Warren speak \u201csemi-regularly\u201d and that the two have \u201copen access to each other.\u201d In July, he hosted Warren in Chicago for a speech to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a civil rights and political activist group he founded, where Warren hammered a legal system that fails to deliver justice when \u201cblack men and women die at the hands of those sworn to protect them\u201d and warned of GOP efforts to restrict voting access. In Warren, Jackson said he sees an economic message \u2013 and a delivery \u2013 that carries few cultural limitations. \u201cThe best news is that these issues affect whites in Appalachia and blacks in the Delta,\u201d he said. Still, Warren has made few trips South, to states like South Carolina, which votes third in the Democratic presidential nominating contest and is the first real gauge of candidates\u2019 support among black voters. \u201cThese communities don\u2019t forget who their friends were,\u201d said Jaime Harrison, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. \u201cThey don\u2019t suffer fools \u2013 they have a test when they know that people are just coming in and they haven\u2019t spent the time to build the network and the connections,\u201d \u201cHarping on anti-trust and Wall Street is not going to cut it,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIn some communities, the economic anxiety is not talking about how much money people are making on Wall Street. Economic anxiety is, no infrastructure, therefore no jobs, and the schools are crap. Therefore their kids, if they get any education, they leave the town and then the state and they never come back.\u201d Warren\u2019s increasing focus on racial and cultural issues began to emerge in April, when she spoke at a major dinner hosted by the NAACP\u2019s Detroit branch. There, Warren said Trump has \u201cstirred up some deep ugliness in the United States,\u201d and she accused Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2013 the subject of the Coretta Scott King letter \u2013 of being on \u201ca mission to turn the clock back 157 years.\u201d \u201cThe fight against racism and inequality and ugliness in all its forms is a righteous fight,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI came to Detroit to say I will be part of that fight.\u201d The remarks struck Warren\u2019s allies, who saw her aggressively confronting issues of race in front of an audience of thousands of black leaders from across the country. \u201cI saw in her speech an intentionality to speak to our communities \u2013 to say, \u2018I\u2019m here for you, and I plan to be a champion on the issues you care about,\u2019\u201d said Curry, the NAACP board member from Boston. \u201cI think being on that particular stage gave her an opportunity to deliver that message to a larger group of African-Americans,\u201d Curry said. Warren moved her cultural messaging beyond a defensive, anti-Trump posture and toward guiding the Democratic Party forward during a closely watched speech at Netroots Nation, the progressive gathering in Atlanta in early August. Since the 2016 election, an emerging divide within the Democratic Party is between those on the left who prefer the message of all economic populism, all the time, and liberals who see issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion and other identity issues as central. \u201cIn the wake of the last election, I\u2019ve heard people say we need to decide whether we\u2019re the party of the white working class or the party of Black Lives Matter,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI say we can care about a dad who\u2019s worried that his kid will have to move away from their factory town to find good work \u2013 and we can care about a mom who\u2019s worried that her kid will get shot during a traffic stop,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way I see it, those two parents have something deep down in common: The system is rigged against both of them \u2013 and against their kids.\u201d Warren also took a dig at Bill Clinton-era policies that are largely seen as corrosive among black voters, declaring that \u201cthe Democratic Party isn\u2019t going back to the days of welfare reform and the crime bill.\u201d In every speech, Warren doesn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s nickname for her, \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 a jab at her Native American heritage. But she harkens back to the moment on the Senate floor, when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said that Warren had been warned against reading the Coretta Scott King letter, but \u201cnevertheless, she persisted.\u201d Warren, who is up for reelection in Massachusetts in 2018 and has been careful not to feed into 2020 speculation, declined to be interviewed for this story, emailing a statement instead. \u201cDivide and conquer is an old story in America \u2013 the idea that whatever worries you, the answer is to blame others who don\u2019t look or talk or worship like you do,\u201d Warren said in the statement. \u201cBut when we turn on each other, we can\u2019t unite to fight back against a rigged system,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s divisive actions don\u2019t reflect our values. We need to say so \u2013 and we need to keep fighting every single day to help build opportunity for every single American.\u201d In Boston, black leaders credit Warren with accessibility and say she is eager to dive into the details of issues with a disproportionate impact on minorities. \u201cThere is almost no issue that impacts communities of color that many of us have not had a conversation directly with her,\u201d said Curry. \u201cShe is abnormally accessible to stop on the street or to catch her in DC and have really detailed conversations around issues that African-Americans care about.\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing on the national stage is what I\u2019ve seen many times in intimate rooms and spaces with Sen. Warren,\u201d said Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilwoman. Pressley said she has worked closely with Warren to combat \u201cpredatory business practices\u201d at for-profit colleges. She also spoke with Warren recently about the stigma about the cannabis industry that prevents banks from lending to minority small-business owners in the space. \u201cShe does not marginalize the community,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cShe sees an African-American in their totality, and I appreciate that. She is inclusive. So I don\u2019t only get a call to come sit at a table about an issue that is disproportionately impacting communities of color. I\u2019m invited into any room where she believes that my office \u2026 or my lens could add value.\u201d Warren, a former Sunday school teacher, also makes regular, unpublicized church visits. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she was in churches and worshiping and people didn\u2019t know she was there. She is just that consistent about her presence in these spaces,\u201d Pressley said. At the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Roxbury in February, Warren discussed the Senate\u2019s admonition over reading the Coretta Scott King letter criticizing Sessions. \u201cNo one got up to defend his record and what he has done in the years since,\u201d Warren said about what transpired in the chamber, according to a Boston Globe account of the visit. \u201cAll they said was, \u2018Be silent, be silent, be silent,\u2019\u201d In an interview ahead of Warren\u2019s visit, King said Warren\u2019s reading of her mother\u2019s letter about Sessions left her \u201cfilled with joy.\u201d \u201cI said, you know, \u2018Wow \u2013 my mother\u2019s voice is coming forth, and she\u2019s been gone for 11 years now.\u2019 I\u2019m always worried, are people going to remember her and her contributions?\u201d King said. King recalled that when her father was assassinated in 1968, he was planning a \u201cPoor People\u2019s Campaign\u201d for economic justice that was aimed at alleviating poverty across racial barriers. She said the fights that progressives take on today for an increased minimum wage, college affordability and mass incarceration are all issues that connect to a broader battle against economic injustice in which she sees Warren as a leader. \u201cHer having a strong economic message, combined with some of the cultural language and sensitivity to how these things play out in the African-American (community), is certainly critical,\u201d King said. But, King added: \u201cYou also have to show me, as well.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Claire McCaskill was asked whether confederate monuments should be removed The Missouri Democrat answered it has a lot to do when the monuments were built Politicians, including President Donald Trump, should resist framing this month\u2019s deadly clashes in Virginia as a fight over monuments, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said Wednesday. \u201cMaking what happened in Charlottesville about monuments is distracting \u2026 and divisive,\u201d McCaskill said Wednesday. \u201cWhat Charlottesville should really be about is unifying this country against hatred and bigotry.\u201d McCaskill, who is up for re-election next year in a state Trump won in 2016, called the division in the country \u201cobvious\u201d and said she wished the President \u201cwould focus more about the unification piece of this than picking things that would continue to divide us.\u201d The racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, more than one week ago left one counterprotester, Heather Heyer, dead, and has thrust race and history to the forefront of political discourse. The President had multiple different public responses about who was to blame for the violence in the bloody clashes, and remarks win which he equated neo-Nazis with counterprotesters have been widely criticized by both parties. RELATED: Here are the Republicans denouncing Trump by name \u201cNever in my life did I think I would see hundreds of people from around the country marching under swastika flags. I didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d see that proudly, without masks, defiantly \u2013 that\u2019s a moment that can unite this country, and unfortunately I think the President missed that opportunity,\u201d McCaskill said. McCaskill\u2019s comments came in response to a question from CNN about what she believes should happen to Missouri\u2019s monuments. In her reply, McCaskill drew a distinction between Confederate monuments built during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and sites like Wilson\u2019s Creek National Battlefield near Springfield. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we look at what the monument is, where it is and when it was put up \u2013 and what it celebrates,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cWe have some battlegrounds in Missouri that are historically important. I think it\u2019s important that we keep those monuments and parks in place \u2026 so that kids can learn about the tragedy of the Civil War.\u201d On the other hand, McCaskill said, monuments erected \u201cas a protest around Civil Rights laws \u2026 probably are not of value in terms of history lessons.\u201d But she said decisions should be made by those communities, rather than in Washington. And, McCaskill added, some of those communities already are taking action. RELATED: Hill Democrats weigh strategies to link GOP to Trump\u2019s controversial \u2018both sides\u2019 comments Earlier this year, St. Louis and the Missouri Civil War Museum reached an agreement to remove a Confederate monument in St. Louis\u2019 Forest Park. During a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, Trump again decried the movement in some cities to remove some of the monuments, blaming \u201cweak, weak people\u201d for allowing it. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take away our culture. They\u2019re trying to take away our history,\u201d the President said. McCaskill, whose re-election race will be closely watched in 2018, is holding a slew of town halls in the state\u2019s rural areas. Trump carried most of those parts of the state in November\u2019s presidential election.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump went to Arizona on Tuesday night and delivered what has now become a trademark speech: Full of invective, victimhood and fact-free retellings of recent historical events. I went through the transcript of Trump\u2019s speech \u2013 all 77 minutes \u2013 and picked out his 57 most outrageous lines, in chronological order. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cAnd just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren\u2019t too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you.\u201d This is, literally, the first line of his speech. Trump is obsessed with the idea that the opposition to him is overstated while the support for him is understated. (They won\u2019t turn the cameras around and show the size of my crowds!)  CNN\u2019s Saba Hamedy, who was on the scene of the protests, said that thousands of people were on the streets of Phoenix. Cops throw gas canisters, protesters throw them back 2. \u201cA lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now. They can get them in. Whatever you can do, fire marshals, we\u2019ll appreciate it.\u201d So many people love me \u2013 it\u2019s hard to fit them all in the building! But, try! 3. \u201cYou know I\u2019d love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible. It is incredible.\u201d For the record: The cameras always show the crowd. Have for months and years. 4. \u201cWe went to center stage almost from day one in the debates. We love those debates.\u201d The election ended 287 days ago, as of last night. 5. \u201cOur movement is a movement built on love.\u201d Trump on the rampage in Arizona For a second, you might have been tricked into thinking that Trump was going to return to the message of unity and justice he laid out at the start of his Afghanistan speech on Monday night. Spoiler alert: He wasn\u2019t. 6. \u201cWe all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future. A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.\u201d The second sentence of this is verbatim from his speech on Monday. But as the rest of Trump\u2019s speech shows, these are just words to him. He reads them but doesn\u2019t understand them. Or believe them. 7.  \u201cI see all those red hats and white hats. It\u2019s all happening very fast. It\u2019s called: \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019\u201d Trump conflates a call to unity and an end to divisiveness with supporting him. The country is coming together because lots of people at a campaign rally have \u201cMAGA\u201d hats on! 8.  \u201cJust like (the media doesn\u2019t) want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK.\u201d [narrator voice]: He didn\u2019t. 9. \u201cSo here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville \u2013 and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don\u2019t know.\u201d Follow this logic: The media says I didn\u2019t condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. I did \u2013 because I have a house there, which many people don\u2019t know. 10. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I said, really fast, here\u2019s what I said on Saturday: \u2018We\u2019re closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia\u2019 \u2013 this is me speaking. \u2018We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.\u2019 That\u2019s me speaking on Saturday.\u201d This is what he actually said (italics/bolding mine): \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides. It\u2019s been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. This has been going on for a long, long time.\u201d Which is not the same thing. At all. 11.  \u201cI think I can\u2019t do much better, right?\u201d No, you could have done much, much better. Just ask your own party \u2013 the vast majority of which condemned your Charlottesville comments. Also, Trump is always doing great! 12. \u201cI hope they\u2019re showing how many people are in this room, but they won\u2019t\u201d [narrator voice]: They were. Trump: Media trying to take away our heritage 13. \u201cI call them anarchists. Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists. They don\u2019t want to talk about the anarchists.\u201d Believe me, I know anarchists. The best anarchists. Bigly. 14. \u201cIf you\u2019re reading a story about somebody, you don\u2019t know. You assume it\u2019s honest, because it\u2019s like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad. It\u2019s so bad.\u201d I have no idea what Trump\u2019s point is here. But MAN, the New York Times is failing, right?!?!? 15. \u201cOr the Washington Post, which I call a lobbying tool for Amazon, OK, that\u2019s a lobbying tool for Amazon.\u201d Amazon doesn\u2019t own the Washington Post. Jeff Bezos does. 16. \u201cOr CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.\u201d I\u2019ll just leave this here. 17.  \u201cI mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning \u2013 I don\u2019t watch it much, but I\u2019m watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right? Little George.\u201d A few things: 1. Trump watches TV constantly. 2. \u201cLittle George\u201d: Trump as bully-in-chief. 18. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I love you because you\u2019re black, or I love you because you\u2019re white, or I love you because you\u2019re from Japan, or you\u2019re from China, or you\u2019re from Kenya, or you\u2019re from Scotland or Sweden. I love all the people of our country.\u201d Interesting that he name-checked Kenya here. 19. \u201cHow about \u2013 how about all week they\u2019re talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside. Where are they? Well, it\u2019s hot out. It is hot. I think it\u2019s too warm.\u201d It was warm! (105 or so.) But, again, multiple media reports \u2013 including CNN\u2019s \u2013 show that there were thousands of protesters. 20. \u201cYou know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they\u2019ve got clubs and they\u2019ve got everything \u2013 Antifa!\u201d My favorite line of the speech \u2013 especially \u201cAntifa!\u201d which Trump shouts. (Also, you must watch this until the end. Trust me.) 21. \u201cThen I said, racism is evil. Do they report that I said that racism is evil?\u201d [narrator voice]: They did. 22.  \u201cNow they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.\u201d This was the second paragraph of CNN\u2019s story about Trump\u2019s August 14 statement on Charlottesville: \u201cRacism is evil \u2013 and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\u201d Trump said in response to the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. 23. \u201cBut, I mean do you ever see anything \u2013 and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings\u201d See #16. 24. \u201cBut with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it. And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on.\u201d The issue was that Trump said \u2013 on Saturday, August 12, and then again on Tuesday, August 15 \u2013 that the violence and hate on display in Charlottesville was \u201con many sides\u201d and then that \u201cboth sides\u201d were responsible for it. And, the news media didn\u2019t condemn Trump for that; it was his own party who did that. 25. \u201cI hit him with neo-Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi. I got them all in there, let\u2019s say. KKK, we have KKK. I got them all.\u201d This is revealing in a way Trump doesn\u2019t mean it to be. He views the naming of the KKK and the neo-Nazis who were responsible for this violence as a box-checking exercise. I said their names \u2013 so what\u2019s the problem?! (Of course,Trump didn\u2019t call out these groups in his initial statement on Saturday, which was the problem.) 26. \u201cSo then the last one, on Tuesday \u2013 Tuesday I did another one: \u2018We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America.\u2019 Trump was actually quoting from his Saturday remarks in these Tuesday comments. And, in that same August 15 press conference, he said this: \u201cI think there\u2019s blame on both sides. You look at \u2013 you look at both sides. I think there\u2019s blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it, and you don\u2019t have any doubt about it either.\u201d 27. \u201cSo that was my words.\u201d Over 2,000 of them in fact. All dedicated to rewriting what he actually said about Charlottesville. 28. \u201cNow, you know, I was a good student. I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They\u2019re elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.\u201d Always remember this fundamental truth about Trump: He has always felt like the guy on the outside looking in, the guy people wouldn\u2019t accept in their social circles and wouldn\u2019t let into their club. Stuffing it in all of their faces is the primal motivation for everything in his life. Hence all the bragging about what he has and what he\u2019s done. Related: Trump and Ric Flair have a lot in common \u2013 including the hair. 29. \u201cThe words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don\u2019t put on those words. And they don\u2019t put on me saying those words.\u201d Trump is not sorry. Not ever. He has convinced himself that what he said initially about Charlottesville was \u201cperfect.\u201d And, I realize this may be getting repetitive, but the media reported every word Trump said about Charlottesville. Period. The end. 30. \u201cAnd yes, by the way \u2013 and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage. You see that.\u201d This is demagogic language from Trump about the media. \u201cThey\u201d are trying to rob us of \u201cour history and our heritage.\u201d You don\u2019t have to look very hard to see racial and ethnic coding in that language. 31. \u201cI really think they don\u2019t like our country. I really believe that.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim that the media doesn\u2019t \u201clike\u201d America is hugely offensive. Offensive and dangerous. Imagine ANY other president saying anything close to this \u2013 and what the reaction would be. 32. \u201cLook back there, the live red lights. They\u2019re turning those suckers off fast out there. They\u2019re turning those lights off fast.\u201d [narrator voice]: They weren\u2019t. 33. \u201cCNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I\u2019m saying tonight, I can tell you.\u201d See #16. 34. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have social media, I probably would not be standing.\u201d Same. 35. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Donald Trump is in a Twitter-storm.\u2019 These are sick people.\u201d Your guess is as good as mine. 36.  \u201cYou would think \u2013 you would think they\u2019d want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don\u2019t. I honestly believe it.\u201dThe media, in Trump\u2019s telling, is rooting against the country. Let me say again: Rhetoric like this is offensive, dishonest and dangerous. 37. \u201cThe New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized.\u201d [narrator voice] They didn\u2019t. 38. \u201cI must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly. Fox treated me fairly.\u201d \u201cI am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco. Fox News is in the bag!\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, March 2016 39. \u201cHow good is Hannity? How good is Hannity? And he\u2019s a great guy, and he\u2019s an honest guy. And \u2018Fox and Friends in the Morning\u2019 is the best show, and it\u2019s the absolute, most honest show, and it\u2019s the show I watch.\u201d Simple truth: Trump likes Hannity and \u201cFox and Friends\u201d because they say nice things about him. He likes people who like him. 40.  \u201cOh, those cameras are going off. Wow. That\u2019s the one thing, they\u2019re very nervous to have me on live television.\u201d [narrator voice] They weren\u2019t. And, they aren\u2019t. 41. \u201cI\u2019m a person that wants to tell the truth. I\u2019m an honest person, and what I\u2019m saying, you know is exactly right.\u201d According to the Washington Post, Trump has made more than 1,000 misstatements since being sworn in as president on January 20. 42. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people outside, but not very many.\u201d He is obsessed with crowd size. Obsessed. 43. \u201cSo, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\u201d He was actually convicted for contempt of court after refusing to stop his long-running targeting of Hispanics. 44. \u201cHe should have had a jury, but you know what? I\u2019ll make a prediction. I think he\u2019s going to be just fine, OK?\u201d The \u201cpardon\u201d tease! Make sure to stay tuned for next week\u2019s episode! 45. \u201cIt was like 115 degrees. I\u2019m out signing autographs for an hour. I was there. That was a hot day.\u201d It was hot. But I am still very popular. Extremely popular. Believe me. (And for what it\u2019s worth, CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak emails: \u201cIt was 106 degrees and he spent no more than 25 minutes shaking hands.\u201d) 46. \u201cBut believe me, if we have to close down our government, we\u2019re building that wall.\u201d \u201cLet me say it again, no more government shutdowns.\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, August 2015 47. \u201c\u2018Extreme vetting\u2019 \u2013 I came up with that term.\u201d \u2026he says proudly. 48. \u201cAnd we have to speak to Mitch and we have to speak to everybody.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t spoken to McConnell in weeks. 49. \u201cBut, you know, they all said, Mr. President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr. President don\u2019t mention any names. So I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t. No I won\u2019t vote \u2013 one vote away, I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn\u2019t\u2019 it? Very presidential.\u201d This is Trump taking a shot at John McCain, who is currently battling brain cancer, for voting against the repeal and replace health care legislation. It\u2019s also Trump showing how closely he reads press coverage and how he likes to openly flout suggestions of being more \u201cpresidential.\u201d 50. \u201cAnd nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who\u2019s weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won\u2019t talk about him. Nobody wants me to talk about him. Nobody knows who the hell he is.\u201d Jeff Flake is a sitting Republican senator.  Trump is running him down in his home state at a campaign rally less than a week removed from touting one of his primary challengers on Twitter. 51.  \u201cDid you see Gruber got fired yesterday? He got fired because he defrauded somebody or something. Something very bad happened. Check it out. Something happened.\u201d Jonathan Gruber didn\u2019t get \u201cfired.\u201d The Vermont attorney general\u2019s office settled a case with him after a two-plus year investigation into whether he had committed billing fraud. 52. \u201cOne vote \u2013 speak to your senator, please. Speak to your senator.\u201d McCain cast one of the deciding votes on health care. But he\u2019s not going to name names! 53. \u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we\u2019ve got none.\u201d This claim is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 not entirely true. Trump believes Kim Jong Un respects US 54. \u201cBut Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us. I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact.\u201d Respect. That. Fact. 55. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months. I really don\u2019t believe it.\u201dTrump believes that by saying things, he wills them into existence and truth. He doesn\u2019t. 56. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take away our culture. They are trying to take away our history.\u201d [dog whistle] 57. \u201cSo I think we\u2019ll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK? Probably.\u201dWay to throw a major policy pronouncement into the end of a speech while negotiations are ongoing!",

Paul LePage defended monuments to the Confederacy in a radio interview on Tuesday, claiming that 7,600 Mainers fought for the South and that the war was initially about land, not slavery. Two Civil War historians contacted by told CNN disputed LePage's assertions. Maine Gov. Paul LePage defended monuments to the Confederacy in a radio interview on Tuesday, claiming that 7,600 Mainers fought for the South and that the war was initially about land, not slavery. Two Civil War historians contacted by told CNN disputed LePage\u2019s assertions. \u201cWhat was the war? If you really truly read and study the Civil War, it was turned into a battle for the slaves, but initially \u2014 I mean, 7,600 Mainers fought for the Confederacy,\u201d LePage, a Republican, said in an interview with Maine radio station WVOM. \u201cAnd they fought because they were concerned about \u2014 they were farmers \u2014 and they were concerned about their land. Their property. It was a property rights issue as it began. The President of the United States, who was a very brilliant politician, really made it about slavery to a great degree.\u201d Slaves were considered property up to and during the Civil War. LePage also said that removing confederate monuments could lead to the removal of history books and monuments to the Oklahoma City bombing and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The Sun Journal first reported LePage\u2019s comments. Jamie Kingman Rice, the director of Library Service at the Maine Historical Society, told CNN that LePage\u2019s 7,600 figure \u201cis not a number that is known to the research community.\u201d David Blight, Civil War historian and professor at Yale, told CNN in an interview that it was doubtful more than a handful of Mainers fought for the Confederacy. The state of Maine was one of the strongest supporters of the Union. Blight also took issue with LePage\u2019s claim that the Civil War was initially a conflict over land. \u201cThat\u2019s patented nonsense. It\u2019s appalling degree of ignorance and misinformation by a governor of a New England state, or any state for that matter,\u201d he said. Blight reiterated that the war was fought over slavery and its expansion into new territories. \u201cThis war was rooted in the problem racial slavery and its expansion, and the ways in which that issue tore apart the American political system and then tore apart the Union,\u201d Blight said. \u201cAnd to say that the war was only in the interest of farmers worried about their property rights is beyond ridiculous in the 21st century.\u201d Matthew Karp, a Civil War historian at Princeton University, told CNN \u201cthe idea that Maine was a Confederate hotbed is pretty ludicrous.\u201d \u201cI have no idea what LePage is talking about,\u201d Karp said. \u201cIn the 1860 Presidential election, the southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge couldn\u2019t even get 7600 votes in Maine. Lincoln won over 62% of the vote (his fourth highest mark in the country) and Maine furnished over 70,000 troops for the Union, including over 9,000 who died during the Civil War.\u201d Karp also said there was no doubt that property rights played an important role in the cause of the Civil War, but that slaves were the property at issue. \u201cAs lots of historians have pointed out recently, the property value of the South\u2019s slaves was somewhere around $3 billion \u2013 more than all the banks, factories, and railroads in the North combined,\u201d he said. \u201cSlaveholders believed their right to human property was enshrined in the Constitution, while Lincoln and the Republicans did not \u2013 a major reason that so many slave-holding leaders embraced secession after Lincoln was elected.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Kasich said he hopes the President learned from recent \"episodes\" \"You can't keep putting new people in the lineup and think you're going to win a world championship,\" he said Ohio Gov. John Kasich denied Sunday that he is planning to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, saying he hopes the President can steer his White House from chaos to stability. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for him to get it together,\u201d Kasich said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe all are.\u201d The Republican governor said he was trying to be a \u201cresponsible voice\u201d and offered hope that Trump \u2013 whom Kasich unsuccessfully challenged in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and whom he has repeatedly criticized \u2013 would grow from experience in office. \u201cI hope we\u2019re going to have stability,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThe President is going to learn from these episodes, and we\u2019re going to do better. That\u2019s what I hope is going to happen.\u201d Schiff: Trump needs 'more adults in the room' Asked about the recent ouster of Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist, Kasich said the staff shakeups were up to the President and not a cure-all to Trump\u2019s difficulty notching accomplishments on his agenda. \u201cThe changes have to stop, and we have to have a team,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep putting new people in the lineup and think you\u2019re going to win a world championship.\u201d Kasich has criticized Trump on a wide range of issues, recently calling Trump\u2019s response to racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, \u201cpathetic.\u201d But in his comments Sunday, Kasich said people should not \u201clook backwards\u201d and tempered his criticism of the President. Kasich said ahead of Trump\u2019s hotly anticipated speech in Phoenix on Tuesday that he hopes those around Trump will get the President to bring people together instead of stoke division. \u201cWhen you go, try to use that as an opportunity to say something that\u2019s going to bring people together,\u201d Kasich said. Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday follows his comments last week attacking Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and suggesting he was mulling a pardon for former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was found guilty of criminal contempt of court stemming from a racial-profiling case. Kasich weighed in at length on the foreign policy front, offering specifics about what he would do in two key areas facing Trump. Kasich criticized the idea of nation-building in Afghanistan, where the US led an invasion following the September 11 attacks, and said, as he did on the campaign trail, it was time for the US military to withdraw. \u201cI think we need to begin to leave there,\u201d Kasich said. He advocated, however, maintaining the option to conduct strikes there in response to intelligence. Trump\u2019s team has been working on a new strategy for US in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis has said Trump was presented with a range of options, from full withdrawal to an increase in troop levels there. On Saturday, Trump tweeted he had made a decision, and Mattis on Sunday confirmed the development but said Trump would be the one to make the decision public. Important day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan. Kasich also staked out a position perhaps even more hawkish than Trump\u2019s on North Korea. He said that if he were President, he would reserve the right to use a pre-emptive strike on Pyongyang to destroy its ability to hit the US with a nuclear weapon and make that option clear to China. The Ohio governor argued the threat to attack North Korea would either spur China to negotiate the end of the North Korean nuclear threat to the US \u2013 or the US would attack the isolated nation of millions. \u201cIt needs to be made very clear to the Chinese: This is in your hands, and if you don\u2019t want to do anything, you\u2019re going to have to live with the result,\u201d Kasich said. The Trump administration has repeatedly called for Chinese cooperation and the de-nuclearization of North Korea, and Trump warned earlier this August he would respond to North Korean threats with unprecedented \u201cfire and fury.\u201d Ahead of joint US-South Korean military exercises this week, Pyongyang said Sunday that the US would not be able to avoid a \u201cmerciless strike\u201d from North Korea.",

            "article_content": "Martese Johnson wasn\u2019t caught off-guard by the violence this weekend at a rally held by white supremacist groups, neo-Nazis, and the KKK in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cI expected it to be a large spectacle,\u201d Johnson told CNN, \u201cbut to be honest I never really thought that we would lose a life at this event.\u201d Johnson, who graduated from the University of Virginia in 2016, was thrust into the spotlight after an encounter with officers outside a college bar turned violent. Johnson was arrested after officers from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control in Charlottesville questioned him about his ID card. Images of Johnson handcuffed, pinned to the ground and covered in blood went viral on social media. Charges against Johnson have since been dropped by the state, and Johnson filed a suit against the Alcoholic Beverage Control director and the agents involved in his arrest. He declined to comment on the status of his lawsuit, saying the case is \u201cstill in legal proceedings.\u201d Events surrounding a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville left three dead on Saturday: 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed by a car that rammed into a crowd of counterprotesters, and two police officers whose helicopter crashed after providing air support to crowd control efforts. Johnson, who currently works for the Chicago International Charter Schools Network, is now an activist, educator and writer in his native Chicago, but he said incidents of racism in Charlottesville are never far from his mind. In an open letter to the incoming UVA freshman class, Johnson expressed frustration at the racial climate the students will be walking into. Johnson told CNN it was \u201csad for the students who are entering the University of Virginia in less than a week and have to cope with such fear and fear of being victimized on a drastic level.\u201d \u201cThe University of Virginia and the Charlottesville community have gradually seen a transition from covert, implicit racism to this past weekend where we\u2019ve seen the most overt and direct racism,\u201d Johnson said. He said that while he was prepared to monitor the rally on Saturday, he was alerted to the torch-lit march on UVA\u2019s campus Friday night by a text from activist DeRay McKesson. \u201cTo hear that was heartbreaking and appalling,\u201d Johnson said. But Johnson said the Saturday rally reached unparalleled levels of racism: \u201cWe are in a completely different era and different mode. What we viewed on Saturday was some of the most blatant performances of discrimination against people for their pure difference that we\u2019ve seen in years in America.\u201d President Donald Trump on Saturday and again on Tuesday blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d in the  Charlottesville rally. Some Trump critics, including Johnson, argue that type of moral equivocation is responsible for the boldness of these fringe groups. Johnson said that in his mind, the election of Trump is responsible for the show of force from white nationalist groups like the Charlottesville rally. In their annual census of hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center has found that the \u201cradical right\u201d has become more active under the Trump presidency. Johnson said these groups are made up of white people \u201cwho believe that if they don\u2019t fight back now, they\u2019ll never be that superior group they once believed they were.\u201d After a KKK rally in Charlottesville in July, Johnson wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post with a fellow UVA student leader that implored the media and the nation to cover the activism pushing back against resurgent white nationalists. His editorial was an attempt to push journalists away from sensationalized stories surrounding  hate groups and to focus on the community\u2019s efforts to counteract them, he said. For the most part, Johnson said, the media\u2019s response to last weekend\u2019s tragic protests has been \u201cimpressive.\u201d He said he\u2019s encouraged by the coverage he\u2019s seen from major media outlets that gives voice to grass-roots organizers. Johnson said this should be a model for covering white nationalists in the future. \u201cJournalists have to understand that it is their responsibility to contribute to positive movements in this country,\u201d he said. Johnson said that for his and others\u2019 advocacy efforts to succeed, the media needs to continue reporting on those fighting against the white nationalist groups beyond the limits of 2017\u2019s ever shrinking news cycle. \u201cThe story goes dry and everybody moves on,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNext week, the week that follows, next month, this problem is still going to exist. Institutional racism is still going to exist. The spawns of that racism, which are the KKK and the alt-right and the neo-Nazis, are still going to exist.\u201d Johnson said he hopes change will come from the horrors of last weekend, and said he knows that media coverage can affect positive change. \u201cWithout thorough reporting on what happened in Charlottesville, we would be living our lives just as we would have last week.\u201d Johnson said he hopes the violence highlights the prevalence of these hateful ideas \u2013 especially for \u201cpeople who feel like they aren\u2019t connected\u201d to racist violence \u2013 and  brings the nation together to confront them. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to go away unless we fight them,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe need to know they exist.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is unpopular, polls show, but Congress is less popular It's unclear if Trump can command support the way other presidents have America may soon face a question of leadership. If a president is judged by a growing slice of the population to have abdicated his office\u2019s traditional imperative to provide steady, moral and unifying authority, where does the nation turn next? The fallout of Donald Trump\u2019s stunning news conference Tuesday has focused largely on the equivalence he appeared to draw between white supremacists and protestors opposing their marches in Charlottesville. The 14 most shocking comments from Trump's Charlottesville news conference But now a debate is also stirring over whether Trump\u2019s remarks have irrevocably severed any chance of this president ever commanding the support, or even the respect, of a majority of the country\u2019s population. Presidents, in their dual role as the figureheads of their administrations \u2013 and heads of state \u2013 are often called upon to summon the country\u2019s resolve, principles and unity at times of crisis or political discord. Even his supporters would concede Trump has never made much attempt to reach out beyond his own base, proving more skillful at exploiting societal divisions for political gain than bringing people together. And there is no sign he plans to start now. Two sources told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny the President was defiant and \u201cwithout regret\u201d over his combustible performance Tuesday, likening the outraged media response to some of the volcanic twists of his campaign. \u201cThe public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!\u201d he tweeted Thursday morning. But barreling ahead and recommitting to the rhetoric that outraged people across the political spectrum could cost the President any goodwill he still has left among people who don\u2019t support him. That in turn would compromise his capacity to unite the nation during a crisis or when the next political volcano erupts. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday revealed the depths of Trump\u2019s problems. His approval rating was plumbing new depths at 35%, suggesting that only his loyal political base is sticking with the President. Some 52% of those polled said the President\u2019s reaction to Charlottesville was not strong enough \u2013 only 27% said it was. With poll numbers that grim \u2013 more typical of a seventh year in office for a president rather than a seventh month \u2013 it is questionable whether Trump can lead the country anywhere. If Trump cannot provide leadership, then the question becomes: Who can? Damaged presidencies often result in Congress taking on a more prominent role, shouldering more of the burden of running the country. CNN Poll: Nearly seven in 10 judge Congress a failure so far But this Congress is even more unpopular than Trump. A growing list of top Republicans, including Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, appear to fear the toxic impact of Trump\u2019s remarks on their party and have criticized the President, taking advantage of their prominence and independent power bases to speak out. Others, like Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, are in the top tier of potential future presidential candidates who have criticized Trump and are playing a game of risk and possible reward. But taking advantage of the August recess, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stayed out of sight. Both decried the content of Trump\u2019s comments but avoided a personal rebuke. RELATED: Here are the Republicans denouncing Trump by name \u201cWe can have no tolerance for an ideology of racial hatred. There are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cWe all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head.\u201d Ryan offered similar sentiments in a tweet Tuesday. \u201cWe must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for,\u201d he said. \u201cThere can be no moral ambiguity.\u201d We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity. While few people would disagree with those fine sentiments, neither leader came across as a profile in courage, since condemning neo-Nazis ought to be the easiest thing a big-time politician would ever do. While the Ryan/McConnell position makes political sense since most Republicans still back Trump, it\u2019s hardly courageous. There\u2019s always the Democrats. And they have spoken as one in outrage at Trump\u2019s remarks. But the party is still working through the trauma of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential election defeat last year and is yet to offer America a compelling political personality or message to break through the Washington cacophony. Former Presidents H.W. and W. Bush denounce racism in wake of Charlottesville Democrats are an afterthought in Washington anyway, since the GOP runs the House and the Senate. And this early in the political cycle, it\u2019s not clear any unaffiliated voters are pining for Democratic leadership. In fact, the only Democrat whose example has broken through in Washington is a leader from the past, not the future \u2013 Barack Obama. The former president\u2019s message quoting Nelson Mandela has just become the most liked tweet in history. Two other former commanders in chief, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, also leveraged the power of their legacies to decry racial discrimination in a clear swipe at Trump in an unusual breach of the normal protocol of the ex-presidents club. Neither mentioned Trump by name in their statement. Outside the political world, some prominent figures have taken a stand. Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck & Co, resigned from Trump\u2019s manufacturing council to take a stand against the President\u2019s remarks about Charlottesville on Saturday. He triggered a mass exodus of CEOs that forced Trump to close down two advisory councils \u2013 an embarrassing blow to his claims to be a business tycoon president who could use his corporate pals to reinvigorate the economy. And while Frazier braved Trump\u2019s Twitter wrath and was the first to exit, you would not have to be a cynic to conclude that the subsequent rush of CEOs to desert Trump had as much or more to do with concern for their blue chip brands than a sudden desire to honor civil rights. RELATED: What happened behind the scenes as Trump\u2019s business councils fell apart In the arts and media, Trump critics have pounced. Late-night hosts dropped comedy routines for social commentary about Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric. Clinton world reacts to Trump: She tried to warn us Editorial boards across the nation excoriated the President. The Chicago Sun-Times branded him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bigot-in-Chief.\u201d But since many conservatives revile the media, the chances that journalists and entertainers can bring the country together are slim. There is one institution that still appears to have bipartisan clout: the military. Five joint service chiefs, apparently conscious of the racially integrated nature of their services, have now condemned white supremacists. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson tweeted as far back as Saturday: \u201cEvents in Charlottesville unacceptable and musn\u2019t be tolerated @USNavy for ever stands against intolerance & hatred.\u201d In another post, on Wednesday, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Mark Milley posted: \u201cThe Army doesn\u2019t tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. It\u2019s against our Values and everything we\u2019ve stood for since 1775.\u201d None of the posts, from sources who take pains to be nonpartisan, mentioned Trump specifically. But they were extraordinary all the same.",

During his news conference, Trump blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d in the protests and equated the white supremacists on one side with the counter-protesters on the other side. Some Republicans, to avoid more conflict, denounced racism after Trump\u2019s news conference \u2013 and some indirectly referred to his statements when they called him out. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a strong critic of Trump, took a hard stance on Wednesday against Trump\u2019s remarks at the news conference. \u201cThrough his statements yesterday, President Trump took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally and people like Ms. Heyer. I, along with many others, do not endorse this moral equivalency,\u201d Graham said in a statement. He continued: \u201cMany Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the Party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world.\u201d Sen. John McCain, whom Trump called out at the news conference for not voting for the GOP health care bill, tweeted, \u201cThere\u2019s no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate& bigotry. The President of the United States should say so\u201d There's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate& bigotry. The President of the United States should say so Sen. Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in the GOP primary, tweeted in a thread, \u201cMr. President,you can\u2019t allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame. They support idea which cost nation & world so much pain\u201d Mr. President,you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame.They support idea which cost nation & world so much pain 5/6 Sen. Jeff Flake, a strong critic of Trump, tweeted, \u201cWe can\u2019t accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism. We must condemn. Period.\u201d We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism. We must condemn. Period. Sen. Cory Gardner also used Trump\u2019s name to say he was wrong at a town hall in Colorado. \u201cThe President was wrong,\u201d Gardner said when asked about Trump\u2019s comments blaming the left, according to Fox31 Denver, a CNN affiliate. Sen. Jerry Moran also called out Trump by name, writing in a tweet: \u201cWhite supremacy, bigotry & racism have absolutely no place in our society & no one - especially POTUS - should ever tolerate it\u201d White supremacy, bigotry & racism have absolutely no place in our society & no one - especially POTUS - should ever tolerate it. Full STMT: pic.twitter.com/dufC1MGWgB Ohio Gov. John Kasich didn\u2019t tweet but instead told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show\u201d on Wednesday that Trump\u2019s remarks were \u201cpathetic.\u201d \u201cThis is terrible. The President of the United States needs to condemn these kinds of hate groups,\u201d said Kasich, who ran against Trump in the Republican presidential primary. \u201cThe President has to totally condemn this. It\u2019s not about winning an argument.\u201d Rep. Ed Royce tweeted, \u201cThe President needs to clearly and categorically reject white supremacists. No excuses. No ambiguity.\u201d The President needs to clearly and categorically reject white supremacists. No excuses. No ambiguity. And Rep. Leonard Lance tweeted, \u201cMr. President, there is only one side: AGAINST white supremacists, neo-Nazis, anti-Semites & the KKK. They have no place in America or GOP.\u201d Mr. President, there is only one side: AGAINST white supremacists, neo-Nazis, anti-Semites & the KKK. They have no place in America or GOP. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who also ran against Trump in the GOP primary, tweeted in a thread denouncing racism: \u201cI urge @POTUS to unite the country, not parse the assignment of blame for the events in Charlottesville.\u201d I urge @POTUS to unite the country, not parse the assignment of blame for the events in Charlottesville. 2/3 And Rep.

Will Hurd to President Trump: \"Apologize ... Racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism of any form is unacceptable\" https://t.co/fXX8j6DDid Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t respond directly to Trump after his news conference but instead released a statement after news that white supremacists are planning a rally in McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky. \u201cWe can have no tolerance for an ideology of racial hatred,\u201d McConnell said in a statement, without using Trump\u2019s name. \u201cThere are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan also didn\u2019t use Trump\u2019s name directly but called the President out in opposition to what he said in the news conference. Ryan tweeted, \u201cWe must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity.\u201d We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who has been a strong critic of Trump since the 2016 election, also didn\u2019t use his name to call him out: \u201cNo, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes.\u201d No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes. GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen tweeted, \u201cBlaming \u2018both sides\u2019 for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no.\u201d Blaming \"both sides\" for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush released a joint statement where they denounced racism but didn\u2019t use Trump\u2019s name. \u201cAmerica must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs we pray for Charlottesville, we are reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city\u2019s most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights. We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Art often reflects the political pulse of society and the issues that people care about. Throughout the 2016 election cycle, CNN Politics will be profiling various influential and politically conscious artists in the \u201cGet political\u201d series. Lil B explains why he switched his allegiance, his take on the black vote in the 2016 race and the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement \"To win African-American voters you have to feel them\" and a lot of these candidates \"don't understand what that means,\" Lil B said California rapper Brandon McCartney, known by his professional name Lil B The Based God, released a track last year expressing his love and respect for Bill Clinton. And in his ode to the former President, titled \u201cB\u2014- I\u2019m Bill Clinton,\u201d he raps a sort of endorsement for Hillary Clinton even before her 2016 presidential bid was announced: \u201cShout-outs to Hillary Clinton. You gonna win that presidency.\u201d CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates But last month, Lil B took that endorsement back, and in a series of passionate tweets, he publicly endorsed Bernie Sanders, saying, \u201cAs much as I want to a woman leading the USA, right now it\u2019s all about Bernie \u2026 he\u2019s the real he loves us.\u201d Who's running for President? The 25-year-old rapper is a former member of the San Francisco rap crew The Pack, who were best known during the mid 2000s for their Billboard-charting hit \u201cVans.\u201d He is outspoken about racial inequality, the criminal justice system and poverty in both his freestyle lyrics and as a motivational speaker, and he has given lectures at universities including MIT, UCLA and NYU. In an interview with CNN, Lil B explained why he switched his allegiance from Clinton to Sanders, his take on the black vote in the 2016 race and the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement. As much as I want to a woman leading the USA, right now it's all about Bernie @BernieSanders @SenSanders he's the real he loves us - Lil B \u201cNo one\u2019s really been saying anything about Hillary Clinton besides that she\u2019s a woman and running for office,\u201d Lil B said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s kind of like the same thing when Obama was running, but the difference is Obama seemed to have a more down-to-earth personality.\u201d Lil B said he was excited by the prospect of the first woman president and had planned to vote for her, and liked her husband. But he said what he learned about Clinton and Sanders\u2019 backgrounds changed his mind. I herd Bernie @BernieSanders @SenSanders marched against segregation in the 60s which was not long ago! I love that brave dude! - Lil B \u201cOnce the people started telling me about Bernie Sanders and comparing what he was doing back in his younger days and what she was doing, it made me kind of look at her different \u2013 not really respect her as much as I thought,\u201d adding that \u201cshe was doing some other stuff for some Republican,\u201d citing Clinton\u2019s support for Sen. Barry Goldwater\u2019s failed 1964 presidential campaign as a \u201cGoldwater girl.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any part in trying to march against segregation. She was just a follower,\u201d Lil B said. And when Sanders followed him on Twitter, the rapper\u2019s admiration for the Vermont senator grew because to Lil B, who candidates follow on social media tells him about who they feel they should be listening to. I don't no Bernie sanders but I want to say I love him and his family I hope he represents honesty and love @BernieSanders - Lil B How do these political people running for government not follow one black person over Twitter? But Bernie @BernieSanders follows me - Lil B Shouts out to Bernie sanders @BernieSanders he's not a paid off politician who was bought off by some private companies stay real - Lil B The streets and the hood is showing love to Bernie @BernieSanders @SenSanders and sayin he got good morals and he follows Lil B LOVE - Lil B check if your fav congress people or senators or mayors or anyone who works with government follow black people on Twitter! Need 2 ! - Lil B When asked whether he vote for Clinton, who received a wave of endorsements from rappers over the last year, in an general election, Lil B said \u201cI want to feel her out \u2026 I always look at where people started and I want to know what she has to say about that.\u201d The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment. After the recent deaths of several young black men and women at the hands of police officers, civil rights and criminal justice reform are high on the rapper\u2019s priority list this election cycle. He released several tracks addressing racial inequality, including \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d in reference to the choking death of Eric Garner last summer in New York. And for \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d a national movement that was initiated after George Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in 2013, activists are pressing candidates on their plans for tackling racial injustice. Many remain unimpressed and disappointed by both parties. Politicians stumble on #blacklivesmatter When asked what candidates need to do to court black voters, Lil B said that if they are not connected to the community, they will not succeed. \u201cTo win African-American voters you have to feel them,\u201d and a lot of these candidates \u201cdon\u2019t understand what that means.\u201d \u201cI wish people grew up in the hood and grew up with adversity and seen s\u2014,\u201d he said. He added that black-on-black crime is \u201creal,\u201d but asks \u201cWhat about the dirty landlords \u2026 the dirty bankers \u2026 the police that are dirty or the dirty court system? With black-on-black crime, most of the times, that comes from poor black people that\u2019s trying to get out. They\u2019re misguided,\u201d he said. When asked about Sanders\u2019 tense interaction with \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d demonstrators, who interrupted a town hall for liberal activists last month, the rapper said that while he did not watch the interaction, the movement should give Sanders a chance. Democrats lose control of presidential event \u201cIt might be uncomfortable for him to talk about the issues but he has a leg to stand on,\u201d Lil B said. \u201cI mean, if he was marching for civil rights back then, he was protesting against segregation \u2026 and all the youth, the black youth, should be able to hear him out.\u201d But the rapper added that candidates have to be able to take the heat. \u201cOf course, with age differences \u2026 he might feel a little weird talking to younger people that might look different \u2026 or might feel a little different,\u201d he said of Sanders. Sanders had another run in with #BlackLivesMatter protesters Sunday, in which about a dozen demonstrators took the stage and grabbed the microphone from the Senator. A post shared by Dan Merica (@dan_merica) Sanders stood a few feet off stage and his aides said that he had no intention of leaving during the protests, but when the mic was not handed back to Sanders, organizers effectively shut down the event. \u201cI think he handled it very classy,\u201d Lil B said. \u201cThere\u2019s some times when these people, they feel the need to speak and they feel like there\u2019s an urgency \u2026 I think Bernie let them speak and its the admirable thing to do \u2026 He didn\u2019t have security escort them off stage. That\u2019s another plus side for Bernie.\u201d Can Bernie Sanders win black voters? While addressing a largely black audience at the National Urban League conference in Miami last month, Democratic presidential candidates Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley seemed to have learned from past troubles, as they each called for racial justice by invoking the three key words: \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d But Lil B said that candidates should not only be addressing people at conferences, but should also be talking to people like him. \u201cI really do represent a lot of people, the poor people \u2026 people who barely got $20 to their name \u2026 the middle class, the teenagers \u2026 people who aren\u2019t paying attention but they still have questions and have voting power,\u201d he said. And his advice to candidates who are trying to connect with a diverse group of Americans? \u201cYou gotta rock with the people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton's supporters say they warned voters of Donald Trump's behavior Trump's comments this week are reminding Clinton aides of a speech last year Many of Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aides sat nervously a year ago this month as their boss stepped up to a podium in Reno, Nevada to decry then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, accuse him of \u201ctaking hate groups mainstream\u201d and come close to labeling him a racist. With a year of hindsight and the sting of a demoralizing election loss slowly wearing off, Clinton\u2019s former aides now feel their campaign is slightly vindicated by the tone and tenor of Trump\u2019s presidency, highlighted by the President\u2019s news conference Tuesday that equated white supremacists at the heart of violence over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia with those who came out to protest racism. There was a deep internal debate within the Clinton campaign on whether the former secretary of state should give a speech that directly challenged Trump\u2019s views on race, according to interviews with more than 10 former top Clinton aides, some of whom asked to speak anonymously because of their current roles in Democratic politics. As Trump contentiously defended the alt-right on Tuesday, though, these former aides were left feeling with one overriding sense: Hillary Clinton tried to warn us. RELATED: Here are the Republicans denouncing Trump by name \u201cThis is what I want to make clear today,\u201d Clinton said, flanked by American flags at Truckee Meadows Community College. \u201cA man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the Internet, should never run our government or command our military.\u201d She added: \u201cHe says he wants to make America great again, but, more and more, it seems his real message is Make America Hate Again.\u201d Nick Merrill, the Clinton campaign\u2019s traveling press secretary and her current spokesman, said the Reno speech was a push to speak at length during the summer about \u201cthe perils of giving in to what Trump represented and what he was inciting.\u201d \u201cWe did it on all mediums, via all quarters of the campaign, from surrogates to candidates,\u201d Merrill said, reflecting on the feeling that his boss tried to warn people about Trump\u2019s past. \u201cI think it is pretty unassailable that we were as clear as we could be on this topic.\u201d Trump\u2019s staggering, impromptu Tuesday news conference outraged Democrats and Republicans alike, but those who worked for years \u2013 and eventually failed \u2013 to stop Trump from winning the White House were particularly distressed, with some aides describing their stomachs turning as they watched the president blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence. Trump, standing in pink marble the lobby of his eponymous tower in Midtown Manhattan, laid bare Tuesday his unvarnished view of whom was to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, which left one woman dead after she was rammed with a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist. \u201cI think there is blame on both sides,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now.\u201d Asked to respond to the Clinton camp\u2019s allegations of racial discrimination by Trump, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \u201cThe president has strongly condemned these groups and all hate and violence.\u201d Clinton responded to the violence in Charlottesville by tweeting Saturday that \u201cthe incitement of hatred that got us here is as real and condemnable as the white supremacists in our streets,\u201d adding in a later message that \u201cevery minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace.\u201d Clinton has yet to respond to Trump\u2019s news conference Tuesday, but to the aides and advisers that helped shape her August 2016 speech, her response was given a year earlier. The decision for Clinton to deliver a speech on Trump\u2019s racial past was never a forgone conclusion inside the campaign. RELATED: Trump \u2013 once again \u2013 fails to condemn the alt-right, white supremacists There was deep debate between a wide array of aides whether a speech from the candidate on Trump and race would be well received and whether the message could be delivered without it being cast as nothing more than an already subterranean political discourse going lower. Clinton, according to an aide, said at one meeting about the speech that she was not prepared to call Trump a racist, something reporters would later ask her directly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is in his heart,\u201d Clinton told her top aides, \u201cbut I want to lay out the facts.\u201d The speech was crafted by Dan Schwerin, Clinton\u2019s longtime speechwriter, who aides said played a major role pushing the speech long before it was delivered. But two former aides told CNN that former President Bill Clinton also had a large part in writing the remarks and focusing the arguments against Trump. Schwerin said Wednesday that the former secretary of state was \u201cadamant\u201d that she would not make \u201cad hominem attacks\u201d against Trump. \u201cThere is no where in this speech where she says Donald Trump is a racist,\u201d Schwerin said. Looking to invigorate Clinton\u2019s base and sway independent and moderates, Clinton and her advisers decided to give a speech that asked Republicans to consider if Trump represented conservatism exemplified by past leaders like Sen. Bob Dole, former President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, whom the former first lady name checked. \u201cThis is not conservatism as we have known it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not Republicanism as we have known it.\u201d Before the speech, according to the former aides, there were two overarching questions: Was Clinton the right messenger for this stinging indictment, and would the speech go too far? \u201cShe is the person who talked about the vast right wing conspiracy,\u201d said a former top aide, referencing what Clinton said in 1998 about Republicans trying to bring down her husband\u2019s presidency. \u201cAnd at the time people thought she was overreacting. \u2026 There was some thought that we didn\u2019t want people comparing the Nevada speech to that argument.\u201d Reflecting on the Reno event on Wednesday, Schwerin said it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to think about how Clinton predicted Trump\u2019s presidency a year before his Trump Tower news conference. \u201cIt is tragic. She said in that speech that his long history of racial discrimination and his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia was a good preview of what he would be like as president and it totally was,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything she said would happen has happened.\u201d The timing of the speech was important, too. Days earlier, Trump had hired Steve Bannon, the controversial former head of Breitbart News, the CEO of his campaign. Bannon, a political operative with a street brawlers reputation who once touted his website\u2019s association with the alt-right, was a primary foil in Clinton\u2019s speech. President Donald Trump on Steve Bannon\u2019s future: \u2018We\u2019ll see\u2019 August was also a unique month for Clinton, a time defined by a series of high-profile and well received speeches, including the Reno remarks. But the overriding focus of the month was fundraising. Days before the speech Clinton headlined a three-day, nine-fundraiser swing through California, hob-nobbing with celebrities like Magic Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. She also went to the tony Hampton\u2019s region of New York, including an event with Jimmy Buffett, Sir Paul McCartney and Jon Bon Jovi at Buffett\u2019s Sag Harbor home. To break through the slog of fundraisers, which were getting considerable attention from the media, the Clinton campaign was eager to get reporters to dig into Trump\u2019s questionable history with race. Campaign surrogates tried to raise the issue in television hits and conversations with reporters before the speech, but when the stories failed to get the attention the campaign believed it deserved, top campaign aides realized the words needed to come from Clinton herself. In hindsight, multiple aides said they would have rather had Clinton hit the road with this new anti-Trump message, not hit the fundraising trail. But, as one aide put it, \u201cI would have done a lot differently given the chance.\u201d Clinton, aides said, bought into the idea of an \u201calt-right\u201d speech, energized by the idea of energizing her base and wooing moderate Republicans with the message. Another reason the speech went forward: The campaign had reams of opposition research, dug up by Clinton staffers in their Brooklyn, New York headquarters, that showed Trump, in the words of one former staffer, \u201cat minimum, had issues with African Americans.\u201d \u201cIt was deep,\u201d the aide said. \u201cAnd started with (Trump\u2019s father) and it continued with his leadership of the company.\u201d The Justice Department accused Trump, then a young real estate developer, and his father, Fred Trump, of housing discrimination in 1973. The Trumps settled two years later, but the court documents were filled with details the Clinton campaign was eager to get to reporters, including the accusation that applications from black applicants to Trump\u2019s buildings were marked with the letter \u201cC\u201d for colored. Trump also waded into the contentious Central Park 5 issue, calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York in a series of newspaper ads after five black and Hispanic teens were accused of brutally raping a 28-year-old banker who had been jogging at night in Central Park. The Central Park 5 were later exonerated, but Trump has stood by their guilt. RELATED: Member of \u2018Central Park 5\u2019 blasts Trump With a year of hindsight, former Clinton aides who worried about the speech now think Clinton could have even gone further. \u201cFrom the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.\u201d She added that \u201csomeone who\u2019s questioned the citizenship of the first African-American president, who has courted white supremacists, who\u2019s been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color, who\u2019s attacked a judge for his Mexican heritage and promised a mass deportation force, is someone who is very much peddling bigotry and prejudice and paranoia.\u201d Some Clinton aides, still recovering from a disorienting loss in November, said watching Trump on Tuesday was like \u201cHillary Groundhog Day.\u201d \u201cWe all say to each other, \u2018She predicted exactly this,\u2019\u201d one former Clinton aide said. \u201cIn her speech, she warned that Trump was mainstreaming hate groups and empowering them to take over the Republican Party, and what we saw yesterday is confirmation that they\u2019ve now taken over the presidency.\u201d Another former aide, said, \u201cyes, she called it,\u201d but added that it is \u201cnot gratifying to say \u2018I told you so,\u2019 since this is so serious.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like we are saying, \u2018I told you so\u2019 and then being pleased with ourselves,\u201d the former aide said. \u201cIt is not good. I would have rather been wrong.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the crimes the Central Park 5 teens were accused of.",

            "article_content": "Mensa said Trump forced America to have an honest conversation about race The rapper's \"16 Shots\" address police brutality and the killing of Laquan McDonald Donald Trump\u2019s victory based on the Electoral College \u2013 and not the popular vote \u2013 underscores that the American government is \u201cnot a government of the people,\u201d rapper and activist Vic Mensa told CNN in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \u201cThe people spoke and elected Hillary Clinton, but this isn\u2019t a real democracy,\u201d Mensa told CNN, a reference to how Clinton leads by 2 million votes in the popular vote count. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019re still operating as a nation off of rules and laws that were enacted as a slave-owning state.\u201d But Mensa, who voted for the Democratic presidential nominee despite being critical of her, said that Trump\u2019s win does come with a silver lining. How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016 For some of the President-elect\u2019s most bitter opponents, a Trump win over Clinton could actually be a \u201cgood thing,\u201d Mensa said, because Trump has forced America to come to terms with some of its darkest and ugliest truths \u2013 racism is alive and well and now we have to confront it. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to hide behind myths of this being a post-racial society because Donald Trump has outlined exactly how a large portion of America feels,\u201d Mensa said. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re losing their birth right as white people to be the masters of the universe, and they\u2019re losing this American dream that was sold to them where you\u2019re always supposed to have a leg up.\u201d CHECK OUT: #GetPolitical \u2014 A CNN Politics original series As opposed to other politicians, who use politically correct, \u201cneutrally-worded messaging\u201d when discussing race relations, \u201cDonald Trump came without a poker face,\u201d Mensa said, and from Muslims, to Latinos, to African-Americans, he outlined his enemies clearly and his supporters no longer had to swallow or sugarcoat their racism. A message left with Trump\u2019s transition team for comment to CNN was not returned. \u201cOur nation has been built upon extreme racism and built on the backs of slaves and just because we don\u2019t have the same incarnation of that racism alive today doesn\u2019t mean that the mental constructs of it are not alive and well and thriving in our society,\u201d Mensa said. As hip-hop braces for a Trump presidency, Mensa said that it is up to Americans who disagree with Trump\u2019s view of the world to \u201cregroup and reassess\u201d ways to offset any harm that a Trump presidency could inflict on the civil liberties of people of color. But the 23-year-old, who spent Thanksgiving weekend at the Standing Rock Native American Reservation to protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline, warns that talking or protesting is not enough \u2013 activists need to make their voices heard at the ballot box by participating in the 2018 congressional election and electing local officials who will champion progressive causes and protect civil liberties. An issue that is close to the Chicago native\u2019s heart and at the center of some of his music, most recently in \u201c16 Shots,\u201d is police brutality and institutionalized racism. \u201c16 Shots,\u201d which is a song off of Mensa\u2019s 2016 album, \u201cThere\u2019s Alot Going On,\u201d chronicles the October 2014 police shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Dashcam video of the shooting contradicted nearly everything police said happened the night McDonald died. It showed McDonald walking away from police as he held a four-inch knife, not lunging toward officers, as police had said. Officer Jason Van Dyke jumped out of his vehicle and pulled his gun, firing at McDonald six seconds after arriving on the scene and unloading every round from his gun in 15 seconds. McDonald was hit by bullets 16 times and the video appears to show the teenager getting hit by bullets even after he was on the ground. Vic Mensa talks Orlando and pledging to vote Mensa said that one of his best friends from the west side of Chicago, where McDonald is also from, was close friends with the teenager, so for the Chicago rapper, the McDonald\u2019s death hits especially close to home. He wrote \u201c16 Shots\u201d to \u201cgive a voice to the young kids\u201d from his community. \u201cThe compliments that matter to me the most are when a kid in my neighborhood runs me down on the skatebaord while I\u2019m driving and he\u2019s like \u2018yo I got something in my heads phones now. You\u2019re speaking for us, G\u2019\u201d Mensa said. \u201cI wrote that song to give him a voice.\u201d The rapper said that as a young black male, he was also targeted by police officers as early as the age of 11 and he wants critics of the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement to understand that people or color are not born will ill feelings towards police officers, but are driven to feel that way because \u201cwe grow up black in America, as targets.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not just born with hatred in our hearts against police officers,\u201d Mensa said. \u201cWe\u2019re oppressed and we develop these attitudes because of being targeted from a very young age just for being who we are \u2026 You chose to put on a badge and a uniform. I can\u2019t take mine off.\u201d Marlena Baldacci and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump nominated Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general It has stoked fears among civil rights activists The future of criminal justice reform hangs in the balance as the nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, was advanced in a party-line vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Activists worry that Trump, who preached \u201claw and order\u201d during his campaign and threatened last week to \u201csend in the Feds\u201d to violence-plagued Chicago, would halt former President Barack Obama\u2019s reforms, and institute new policies that could worsen conditions. Barack Obama\u2019s evolution in 10 years of hip-hop lyrics \u201cThe Republican Party right now is divided between people who recognize now that the criminal justice system is a big failed, unaccountable government bureaucracy that\u2019s wasting money and lives on the one hand,\u201d CNN political commentator Van Jones told CNN. \u201cOn the other hand, you have people who want to stick with the same old dumb on crime, lock \u2018em up policies that have made things worse, not better. Where Trump comes down is not clear yet.\u201d Trump is expected to move ahead with an executive action this week addressing local crime-fighting and curbing the sale of drugs in the United States. Here\u2019s why activists and civil rights groups fear Trump\u2019s White House could turn a deaf ear to racial biases in law enforcement and policing: Trump\u2019s nomination of Sessions to be the next attorney general has exacerbated concerns that policing and sentencing reforms initiated by Obama would come to an end. As President, Obama granted 1,715 commutations for non-violent drug offenders \u2013 more than the past 12 presidents combined. Of those, 568 of the individuals who received lesser sentences had been sentenced to death. Sessions slammed Obama\u2019s efforts as a \u201cweakening of some of our most important criminal sentencing policies.\u201d As a candidate, Trump accused the Obama White House of giving \u201cdrug dealers and gang members\u201d a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d and turning them \u201cloose on the street.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union, a strong advocate for criminal justice reform, wrote a letter last week urging leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a second hearing and cancel the vote on the senator\u2019s nomination. Obama faces the future as Sessions confronts his past During his confirmation hearing earlier this month Sessions was met by strong opposition from Senate Democrats, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who became the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow sitting senator at a confirmation hearing for a Cabinet position. Booker slammed Sessions during the hearing, specifically citing his concern with his colleague\u2019s voting record on \u201cthe crisis of mass incarceration.\u201d \u201cHis record indicates that at a time when even the FBI director is speaking out about implicit racial bias in policing and the need to address it; at a time when the last two attorneys general have taken steps to fix our broken criminal justice system \u2026 Sen. Sessions would not continue to lead urgently needed change,\u201d Booker said. Cory Booker testifies against Sessions \u201cAmerica needs an Attorney General who is resolute and determined to bend the arc. Senator Sessions\u2019 record does not speak to that desire, intention, or will,\u201d he added. But former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson defended Sessions at the hearing and applauded his bipartisan work with Sen. Dick Durbin in passing the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the sentencing disparity between offenses for crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. \u201cSen. Sessions would vigorously, but impartially enforce our laws,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cOf all our important civil rights, the rights to be safe and secure in one\u2019s home and neighborhood is perhaps the most important,\u201d he added. The ACLU said that while the Fair Sentencing Act was a \u201ca step toward fairness,\u201d the law \u201cstill reflects outdated and discredited assumptions about crack cocaine.\u201d Sessions defended his record on criminal justice reform while being questioned by Durbin during the hearing and referenced a similar 2001 bill he co-sponsored, which was then criticized by the Bush administration. \u201cI stepped out against my own Republican administration and said openly on the floor of the Senate that I believed these crack cocaine laws were too harsh,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cand it was disadvantageous to the African-American community where most of the punishments were falling.\u201d Sessions\u2019 nomination has also been dogged by old allegations of racism, which stem from racially charged comments he allegedly made as a US attorney in Alabama, which led him to be denied a federal judgeship 30 years ago. While the ACLU says they do not take a position supporting or opposing judicial nominations, the group has contested Sessions\u2019 position on civil rights issues. During Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing the ACLU\u2019s legal director David Cole urged lawmakers to consider the Senator\u2019s record on civil rights \u2014 namely his opposition to the 1964 Voting Rights Act. Sessions defended himself against accusations of racism at the hearing and said he was unfairly portrayed as a racist in the past. \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare myself well in 1986 and there was an organized effort to caricature me as something that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate,\u201d he added. RECAP: Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing (Day 1) And William Smith, a longtime Sessions staffer, defended the senator\u2019s record at the hearing, saying, \u201cAfter 20 years of knowing Sen. Sessions, I have not seen the slightest evidence of racism because it does not exist.\u201d But the NAACP, which vehemently opposes Sessions as attorney general, issued an action alert for supporters Wednesday, urging them to contact their lawmakers and oppose Sessions. \u201cSen. Sessions as AG is deeply troubling, and supports an old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values,\u201d the NAACP tweeted. Sessions previously called the ACLU and the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d and said these organizations \u201cforced civil rights down the throats of people.\u201d Throughout the 2016 campaign Trump argued repeatedly that stop-and-frisk policies reduced crime in New York City and in September, he called for implementing these controversial policies in Chicago. A US District Court judge ruled in 2013 that New York City\u2019s use of stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional because it violates the Fourth Amendment and has been used to target people based on race. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed Trump\u2019s claim that the practice led to a reduction of crime. \u201cWith stop-and-frisk down nearly 97% from its high point in 2011, crime in New York City is now at record lows,\u201d de Blasio wrote in a September op-ed for CNN. \u201cStop-and-frisk was not a driver of that public safety progress. Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to admit this and his willingness to inflame tensions for political purposes isn\u2019t just foolish. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he added. Despite the tactic being ruled unconstitutional, Trump insisted that stop-and-frisk is \u201cconstitutional\u201d during the first presidential debate and said that implementing it in Chicago would \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d save African-American and Hispanic lives. Sessions later agreed with Trump, telling Bustle, \u201cIt\u2019s all about how that is done.\u201d Over the past two years, Obama-appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch launched several Justice Department investigations into police departments around the nation, including Ferguson, Baltimore and Chicago, revealing patterns of racial discrimination in policing and cases of excessive force. In some cases, the Obama White House has used consent decrees to make changes in policing, which require the city to implement reforms under court supervision, whether the police department agrees with the findings or not. Whether a Trump administration will act to address these findings, open new investigations or utilize consent degrees is yet to be seen. Hip-hop braces for a Donald Trump presidency Sessions suggested during his confirmation hearing that as attorney general he could move the Justice Department away from the use of consent decrees, saying that police departments \u201coften feel forced to agree to a consent decree just to remove that stigma and sometimes there are difficulties there.\u201d Trump criticized the federal government\u2019s interference in state policing as a candidate and said that law enforcement should be \u201ca local or state issue.\u201d \u201cMost law enforcement is local in nature and should be dealt with accordingly. If the federal government can provide assistance in facilitating stronger community relationships, then the Trump administration will be there to assist. Otherwise, state and local authorities must answer to their own constituencies,\u201d Trump wrote in response to a question from the International Association of Chiefs of Police on how he would work to improve relations between communities and the police. Sessions also accused the Obama White House of politicizing the issue. Donald Trump on the 'Black Lives Matter' movement \u201cThere is a perception, not altogether unjustified, that this department and the Civil Rights Division goes beyond fair and balanced treatment. \u2026 That\u2019s been a troubling issue for a number of years, frankly,\u201d Sessions said during a Judiciary Senate Committee hearing in November 2015. Trump slammed the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement as a candidate, lamented a \u201cwar on police,\u201d and accused the group of helping to instigate police shootings through their protests and rallies against police brutality. When asked in July if he would investigate \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d as president, Trump suggested that his attorney general would \u201cdo something.\u201d \u201cWe are going to have to, perhaps, talk to the attorney general about it or do something,\u201d he said. In a statement released following Trump\u2019s election, the Black Lives Matter movement, called on people to organize: \u201cDonald Trump has promised more death, disenfranchisement and deportations. We believe him. The violence he will inflict in office, and the permission he gives for others to commit violence, is just beginning to emerge. In the face of this, our commitment remains the same: protect ourselves and our communities.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\"Why do you wish someone else was in office? Is it so the snake can go back into the grass?\" David Banner tweeted Banner's comments reflect a larger trend in how hip-hop is coming to terms with Trump In hip-hop, not everyone wants white supremacists to remain silent and not everyone wants President Donald Trump to unequivocally condemn them. \u201cI\u2019d rather an ugly truth than a beautiful lie,\u201d rapper and activist David Banner tweeted. The tweet echoed a sentiment he voiced the day after Trump won the general election: \u201cThis may be the best thing to ever happen to black people, maybe in history, because now there is no excuse. I think the veil of America has been ripped off. The fake mask has been ripped off.\u201d I'd rather an ugly truth than a beautiful lie. #theGodbox https://t.co/R6OuG5UsfF During an off-the-cuff news conference Tuesday, Trump drew an equivalence between white supremacists and the protesters who condemned them \u2013 a view he also voiced on Saturday \u2013 by saying there was \u201cblame on both sides\u201d for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Trump\u2019s comments drew praise from David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and also caused a backlash of bipartisan outrage from lawmakers, who called on the President to declare that there\u2019s no equivalency between white supremacists and the people who oppose them. Nas urges action in the age of Trump: \u2018We all know a racist is in office\u2019 \u201cY\u2019all can hate and wanna push them back into the dark but I wanna thank them for being honest. America is still the same place as 53 yrs ago.\u201d Killer Mike \u201cWhy do you wish someone else was in office? Is it so the snake can go back into the grass? No let it show its head so we can deal with it,\u201d Banner tweeted in response to the outrage, which rocked social media. Why do you wish someone else was in office? Is it so the snake can go back into the grass? No let it show its head so we can deal with it. When images of torch-wielding white supremacists marching at the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville went viral over the weekend, Atlanta rapper and activist Killer Mike shared a similar sentiment. \u201cY\u2019all can hate and wanna push them back into the dark but I wanna thank them for being honest. America is still the same place as 53 yrs ago,\u201d Killer Mike wrote on Instagram, and he criticized Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) in a separate post for calling for more restrictive gun laws. How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016 \u201c\u2026 any black politician who tells you to not be fire arms trained and owners is a paid agent of the state that has always allowed these men to murder the innocent. Stay ready. Fish, Farm, Hunt, Shoot,\u201d Killer Mike wrote, along with a picture of the white supremacist rally. And in an Instagram post responding to the rally in Charlottesville, Chicago rapper Common called out those who said that racism is not a part of America. \u201cI heard a pundit on the news say, \u2018this isn\u2019t America!\u2019 BUT IT IS! This has been America since it began looking down on others (Native Americans, Black people, Latino People, Jewish People). This has always been apart of the American DNA,\u201d Common wrote, adding, \u201cFor sure there are other aspects to America that are beautiful, positive \u2026 However, these ugly parts need to be addressed.\u201d Killer Mike, Common and Banner\u2019s comments mirror a larger trend in how hip-hop is coming to terms with Trump\u2019s presidency. These views are in no way an indication that hip-hop, which is ramping up its activism in the age of Trump, is accepting the President, but an indication that this community wants an honest conversation on race. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to hide behind myths of this being a post-racial society because Donald Trump has outlined exactly how a large portion of America feels.\u201d Vic Mensa As Kendrick Lamar raps in the song \u201cXXX\u201d from his double platinum 2017 album, \u201cDamn\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s in office, we lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again. Is America honest, or do we bask in sin?\u201d Joey Badass gets political: There's a silver lining to the Trump presidency Many in the hip-hop community who have been advocating for racial justice and equality for years welcomed what they considered to be a crucial coming-to-terms with America\u2019s dark past of slavery, segregation and civil unrest and how it still plays out today. This sentiment is embodied in this lyric from Florida rapper Rick Ross\u2019 2017 song \u201cApple of My Eye\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m happy Donald Trump became the President because we gotta destroy before we elevate.\u201d Brooklyn rapper Joey Badass, who released the album \u201cAll-Amerikkkan Badass\u201d in the spring, told CNN\u201ds #GetPolitical in April that the rise of Trump has led to an \u201cawakening\u201d when it comes to the state of race relations in America and has caused a positive shift in hip-hop: Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. \u201cI definitely feel like hip-hop is going through a change right now \u2026 a lot of musicians are realizing and stepping up to the plate and, you know, almost accepting their responsibility, like OK, we are the leaders of the people. We are the voices. We speak for all of these people,\u201d Joey Badass said. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s a change for the better and is definitely the silver lining in the gray cloud of everything that\u2019s happening in our current political climate,\u201d he added. Vic Mensa gets political: The people elected Hillary Clinton, 'but this isn't a real democracy' A week after Trump won the election, Chicago rapper Vic Mensa, who said he reluctantly voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, told CNN\u2019s #GetPolitilcal that a Trump win could actually be a \u201cgood thing\u201d because Trump was forcing America to come to terms with the fact that racism is alive and well \u2013 and showing that Americans had to confront it. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to hide behind myths of this being a post-racial society because Donald Trump has outlined exactly how a large portion of America feels,\u201d Mensa said. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re losing their birthright as white people to be the masters of the universe, and they\u2019re losing this American dream that was sold to them where you\u2019re always supposed to have a leg up.\u201d While some politicians use \u201cneutrally worded messaging\u201d to avoid controversy when discussing race relations, \u201cDonald Trump came without a poker face,\u201d Mensa said, adding that Trump outlined his enemies clearly, which allowed supporters to no longer swallow or sugarcoat their racism. \u201c(Trump) supports some of the racist ideals that this country does have and we\u2019ve got to acknowledge that.\u201d Common Shortly before Election Day, Clinton supporter Common told CNN\u2019s #GetPolitical that there is a silver lining to the rise of Trump because the unleashed racism that has been \u201cbubbling\u201d underground in America and \u201csometimes it has to go to that dark place for us to get to that light.\u201d Common reflects on black America, Obama's legacy and the silver lining of Trump \u201c(Trump) supports some of the racist ideals that this country does have, and we\u2019ve got to acknowledge that,\u201d the Chicago rapper said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing that this is brought out \u2026 because we need to know it exists and stop acting like it doesn\u2019t and not be fooled because President Obama was in office.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump's remarks signaled a deep disconnect between the President and many Americans Trump's comments sent signals that he was more concerned about not upsetting a segment of his base President Donald Trump revealed Tuesday the driving force behind his initial response to the violent clashes that broke out Saturday in Charlottesville: his political base. Trump\u2019s initial response to the violent protests sparked by a racist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi rally was to avoid condemning those groups by name and instead blame \u201cmany sides\u201d for the violence. On Tuesday, he again blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d and signaled he was standing up for those who oppose the removal of Confederate monuments from public squares \u2013 making clear he was more concerned about not alienating his political base than exercising his moral responsibility as President. \u201cNot all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee,\u201d Trump said, emphasizing at several points during the impromptu news conference that the rally protesting the statue\u2019s planned removal was attended by non-white supremacists as well. And then, as if channeling the views espoused by many Americans who flocked to his rallies during the presidential campaign by the thousands \u2013 those Americans Trump could easily picture protesting the statue\u2019s removal without adhering to white supremacist ideology \u2013 he added: \u201cSo this week it\u2019s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson\u2019s coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? \u2026 You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re changing history. You\u2019re changing culture,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s point \u2013 which helps explain his restrained Saturday statement \u2013 was that efforts to remove Confederate symbols around the country aren\u2019t just opposed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, but by a much larger share of Americans who supported him in the presidential election. And Trump appears to have been wary of alienating that segment of his base \u2013 declining on Saturday and Sunday to issue a more forceful statement until a heavy Republican backlash prompted him to offer a full-throated condemnation of white supremacist groups on Monday. Activist campaigns to strip public squares of confederate symbols, charges sometimes led by leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement, who were regularly booed and disparaged by Trump supporters during the campaign, have sparked controversy throughout the South. More than half of Americans viewed the Confederate flag as a symbol of Southern pride, according to a July 2015 CNN/ORC poll \u2013 the most recent polling on this question. In Louisiana, a hot spot in the debate over Confederate symbols, 73% of people surveyed said they opposed the removal of Confederate monuments, according to a 2016 Louisiana State University poll. Still, Trump\u2019s remarks signaled a deep disconnect between the President and many Americans, who watched in horror as a rally organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists turned violent and later as video of a car manned by an apparent white supremacist rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one. Trump\u2019s comments Saturday, and his lengthier explanation and defense of those comments Tuesday, sent signals that the President was more concerned about not upsetting a segment of his base than he was about unifying the country. Trump insisted Tuesday he wanted to \u201cget the facts\u201d before condemning neo-Nazis and white supremacists by name. But the explanation doesn\u2019t hold water as Trump has frequently side-stepped facts and has been quick to cry \u201cterrorism\u201d well before authorities have reached any conclusions. The case Trump laid out Tuesday \u2013 emphatically and repeatedly \u2013 appeared pulled from the talking points of conservative and \u201calt-right\u201d commentators who have also warned about a slippery slide toward \u201cthe eradication of history,\u201d as conservative commentator Laura Ingraham put it earlier Tuesday on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d a program Trump routinely watches. \u201cThis is not about racial healing. This is about the control of the narrative and a destruction of historical recognition,\u201d Ingraham said, before referring to leftist activists who have pushed for the removal of Confederate monuments. \u201cHow long before they show up at Monticello, where I spent three years in law school at Charlottesville in Virginia? How long before they show up at Mount Vernon?\u201d The President\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, also brings a deep understanding of Trump\u2019s base and their concerns. That\u2019s one of the reasons the President has so far refused to eject the former Breitbart chief amid mounting calls for the rabble-rousing populist who considers himself an \u201ceconomic nationalist\u201d to be pushed out. Bannon is a crucial voice inside the White House who can easily channel the President\u2019s base, just as he keeps track of the President\u2019s campaign trail promises on a wall in his West Wing office. Bannon, sources said, communicated with the President via text on Saturday as he prepared to respond to the Charlottesville protests that turned violent. Trump\u2019s statements this week in the aftermath of the Charlottesville incidents come as the President continues to face upside down favorability ratings, with just 36% of Americans approving of his job as President, according to the latest Gallup poll. With his political capital already floundering, Trump knows he can\u2019t afford to lose any more support if he intends to make inroads in implementing his agenda.",

            "article_content": "Norris' endorsement comes just over a week before Alabama Republicans will vote in the special primary election Rep. Mo Brooks and appointed Sen. Luther Strange are also seeking the Republican nomination for the seat Actor and martial artist Chuck Norris has endorsed former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in next week\u2019s primary election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 old Senate seat. \u201cJudge Roy Moore is the real deal,\u201d Norris said in a statement announcing his support Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s tough, tested, and has a spine of steel.\u201d Norris, an Air Force veteran and active Republican, added, \u201cAlabama needs Judge Moore there doing what he\u2019s always done: fighting to protect our constitutional rights to life, religious liberty, and the freedom to protect ourselves and our families. And he will always put principle over politics.\u201d Moore reciprocated the praise, stating that he was honored to have the support. \u201cChuck Norris is exactly the kind of guy you want on your side,\u201d Moore said in a news release announcing the endorsement. Norris\u2019 endorsement comes just over a week before Alabama Republicans will select their nominee to run for the seat. The special election primary is August 15, but if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote \u2013 as GOP operatives say is likely \u2013 then a runoff between the top two candidates will be held September 26, with the victor facing the Democratic nominee in the general election December 12. Three Republican candidates have arisen as frontrunners in a field of eight contenders. Moore is running against the incumbent, Sen. Luther Strange, and Rep. Mo Brooks in what has proven a close \u2013 and contentious \u2013 race. Super PAC ads have flooded the airwaves in Alabama as top GOP operatives and donors support their preferred candidates. Strange was appointed to fill Sessions\u2019 vacant seat by then-Gov. Robert Bentley, who resigned in scandal in April. Strange had been serving as the state\u2019s attorney general until the appointment. Brooks, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, has served in the House since 2011. Moore was suspended as chief justice of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court by the state Court of the Judiciary in May 2016 for refusing to comply with the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Moore said the Supreme Court decision was worse than its 19th-Century decision upholding racial segregation. Moore was previously removed as chief justice in 2003 for defying a federal court order to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building, where the state Supreme Court is located. But he was elected again as chief justice of the state\u2019s high court in 2012.",

            "article_content": "Cory Booker making the national legalization of marijuana a centerpiece of a racial justice bill Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is making the national legalization of marijuana a centerpiece of his new racial justice bill \u2013 staking out a position that goes far beyond the decriminalization other Democrats have backed. The bill is an effort to \u201cremedy many of the failures of the War on Drugs,\u201d Booker wrote on Facebook. It would also aim to undo some damage from marijuana laws by expunging federal marijuana convictions and penalizing states with racially disparate arrests for marijuana-related crimes. By taking this stance before other major Democrats, Booker has positioned himself as a leader on a social justice issue. California Sen. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, is championing legislation with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to overhaul pre-trial bail laws so that poorer people aren\u2019t stuck behind bars for months while accused of minor crimes. From a 2020 perspective, Booker\u2019s bill is important for two reasons: African-Americans are a hugely important part of the Democratic electorate, starting in South Carolina \u2013 and blacks are disproportionately hit by harsh enforcement marijuana laws. Booker\u2019s position is also popular with millennials, most of whom flocked to Bernie Sanders in 2016. IOWA\u2019S STEAK FRY RETURNS: The Steak Fry \u2013 that progressive showcase for presidential aspirants long hosted by former Sen. Tom Harkin \u2013 is back. Set your calendars for September 30 at Water Works Park in Des Moines, where Polk County Democrats will take over hosting duties and Reps. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio are the headliners of an event that\u2019s been dormant since Harkin\u2019s 2014 retirement. The three \u2013 all important to House Democrats\u2019 future \u2013 are interesting for different reasons: Bustos, a former broadcast journalist, won in a heavily Trump district. Ryan challenged Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader and has been making visits to early states. And Moulton is seen as a real emerging star who has raised money and helped recruit candidates and therefore has credibility to challenge his own party. Here\u2019s one more name you should get to know: Sean Bagniewski. He\u2019s the new chairman of the Polk County Democrats \u2013 and a rising star himself in Iowa Democratic politics. He\u2019ll get major credit for resurrecting the steak fry, which will be a boon for the county party\u2019s coffers. WAITING FOR DEVAL: Hold on \u2013 Barack Obama and several of his closest political advisers want the next president to come from Bain Capital? That\u2019s what Politico\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports, noting that Obama has urged former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick to consider running in 2020. Two things you need to know about Patrick: 1) He\u2019s a managing director at Bain Capital \u2013 yes, that Bain Capital, the one where Mitt Romney worked \u2013 where Patrick oversees investments in companies that address social problems. It\u2019s the kind of job you take if you don\u2019t want to run for office again. 2) Obama world knows this is a political liability if Patrick does want to run for office again, but loves him anyway and would line up to work for him. \u201cIt\u2019s true. We all love Deval,\u201d one senior Obama veteran told me. \u201cI think he is exactly the right kind of candidate and someone who I truly admire and think has what it takes to win. And I agree that the Bain resume is far from ideal. His other corporate work will also be a tough sell. But he would be top tier right away and attract the best campaign talent.\u201d SANDERS SUPPORTERS TARGET HARRIS: Some of Bernie Sanders\u2019 allies this week amped up their criticism of California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2013 a reflection of both the restlessness within his base and that Harris has emerged as a serious 2020 player. Mic\u2019s Andrew Joyce highlights attacks on Harris from National Nurses United\u2019s RoseAnn DeMoro, People for Bernie\u2019s Winnie Wong and journalist Nomiki Konst in noting a \u201cBernieland problem.\u201d They take issue with Harris for cozying up with top Democratic donors, and they blast her for not prosecuting now-Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin during her time as California attorney general. It led to sharp rebuttals ranging from Neera Tanden, the head of the Center for American Progress, to Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the progressive blog DailyKos.com, who pointed out that Harris has already taken the policy positions they demanded. Why attack Harris, and why now? I asked CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg, who covers progressives. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cFirst off, don\u2019t overthink it. Harris is a dynamic politician whose national profile is on the up, along with her fundraising prowess, meaning she is gaining attention \u2013 and attention-grabbing headlines \u2013 as a potential 2020 primary candidate. For progressive activists who are turned off by parts of her record as California\u2019s attorney general, that\u2019s a cue to push back. It\u2019s as simple as that. She won\u2019t be the last center-left 2020 hopeful to have her bona fides questioned by progressives. Nor is this the last time the party establishment returns fire, creating that gnawing sense of 2016 redux. \u201cIt\u2019s also important here to consider the state of Sanders\u2019 2020 ambitions. Even as many progressives stay earnestly focused on local races and gaining strength within the Democratic Party apparatus, make no mistake: they are on edge waiting for his decision and will attack anyone they see developing a following that could foreclose his chances in the primary. Hence, the jabs at Harris.\u201d One more thought several Democratic operatives expressed to me: Sanders didn\u2019t win the nomination in 2016 because he lacked minority support. By attacking a woman of color who is well-liked by Democrats across the board, his allies aren\u2019t doing him any favors if he wants to run again in 2020. WARREN\u2019S HEARING AID BILL PASSES: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is known as a liberal firebrand \u2013 but a bill she sponsored with Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Johnny Isakson is now headed to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. The bill makes hearing aids available over-the-counter \u2013 which could lower prices and expand availability, since currently only one in six Americans suffering from hearing loss get hearing aids. And significantly, for Warren, it\u2019s a tool to rebut charges she\u2019s merely a partisan bomb-thrower with nothing to show for her time in the Senate as she runs for re-election. It was the eighth bill to pass the Senate in a roll call vote this year. ANOTHER ZUCKERBERG POLITICAL HIRE: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg added another presidential campaign veteran this week, with Democratic pollster Joel Benenson \u2013 the pollster for Obama and a top adviser to Hillary Clinton \u2013 joining Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan\u2019s nonprofit as a consultant. Already, Zuckerberg had brought Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe on as president of policy and advocacy and hired former Tim Kaine spokeswoman Amy Dudley. Ken Mehlman, who managed George W. Bush\u2019s campaign, is on Zuckerberg\u2019s board.

            "article_content": "Judges deny request to hold special election but set redistricting deadline High court upheld finding 28 districts were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders North Carolina does not have to hold special elections ahead of its 2018 spring legislative session, a panel of three federal judges ruled in a gerrymandering case. But the judges on Monday set a September 1 deadline for state lawmakers to \u201cadopt and enact remedial districting plans\u201d after they had ruled last year that 28 legislative districts were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. The US Supreme Court had affirmed the lower court\u2019s findings in June. The plaintiffs had argued the state\u2019s plans packed African-Americans in districts already with a high percentage of black voters, thus diluting their presence in neighboring districts. In August 2016, the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina found that that 28 legislative districts \u201care racial gerrymanders in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d North Carolina then took the case to the Supreme Court. SCOTUS sends North Carolina gerrymander case back to lower court In June, the high court unanimously affirmed the three-judge panel\u2019s findings. But it also vacated the lower court\u2019s order for special elections and sent it back to the panel for a new hearing on whether North Carolina should have special elections after redistricting. On Monday, the judges rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a special election. That means that North Carolinians will vote in new districts for the first time in November 2018 elections. The judges wrote that \u201cconstitutionally adequate districts should be enacted as quickly as possible to protect the rights of North Carolina citizens.\u201d The September 1 deadline may be extended until September 15, provided the committees from the General Assembly show evidence of progress and public hearings during the redistricting process. The General Assembly is the bicameral legislature of North Carolina, consisting of a House and Senate. Republican lawmakers hold the majority in both houses and have enough members to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s vetoes. \u201cFor far too long, the General Assembly has delayed justice for those North Carolinians who were assigned to districts solely on the basis of their skin color,\u201d said the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which had taken part in the lawsuit. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step toward correcting that the injustice \u2013 by requiring the legislature make public (its) plans to redraw the state\u2019s affected districts.\u201d The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled in another case concerning North Carolina and gerrymandering claims. Supreme Court strikes down North Carolina congressional district maps In May, the court struck down two congressional district maps, holding that the state had engaged in an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Democrats and civil rights groups argued the map packed African-Americans into two districts. It made it easier for African Americans to re-elect incumbents to those two seats but diluted their votes in surrounding areas. \u201cA state may not use race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the majority, referring to a 1993 court standard, \u201cunless it has a compelling reason.\u201d North Carolina has been nearly split along partisan lines in recent statewide elections \u2013 such as for governor and president \u2013 but Republicans control 10 US House seats compared with three for Democrats. CNN\u2019s Daniella Diaz and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The President would like to provide some context. As with so many of his predecessors, President Donald Trump is inclined to recall historical events to better frame his own performance and political agenda. President Barack Obama was said to favor a \u201cteam of rivals\u201d in building his Cabinet, a term the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin coined in a book on President Abraham Lincoln and his administration. Republicans have for years channeled \u2013 and sought to align themselves with \u2013 President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his campaign and first six months in the White House, Trump has spoken of the past \u2013 his slogan, \u201cMake American Great Again,\u201d states explicitly his desire to return to some idealized version of it. (Note: He said in a March 2016 New York Times interview that the beginning of the 20th century and the years after World War II were eras of true US greatness.) He\u2019s also expressed a fondness for President Andrew Jackson, at one point suggesting that, had Old Hickory come around \u201ca little later, you wouldn\u2019t have had the Civil War.\u201d In early February, at a breakfast to mark the beginning of African-American History Month, he shouted out 19th century abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who died more than 120 years ago, as \u201can example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d In another extended \u2013 and eye-popping by any standard \u2013 interview with the New York Times published on Wednesday, the President again revisited some notably historical markers, conjuring them in unmistakably Trumpian terms. Trump: It\u2019s a tough \u2013 you know, health care. Look, Hillary Clinton worked eight years in the White House with her husband as president and having majorities and couldn\u2019t get it done. \u2026 Obama was in there for eight years and got Obamacare. Hillary Clinton was in there eight years and they never got Hillarycare, whatever they called it at the time. \u2026 Obama worked so hard. They had 60 in the Senate. They had big majorities and had the White House. I mean, ended up giving away the state of Nebraska. They owned the state of Nebraska. Right. Gave it away. Their best senator did one of the greatest deals in the history of politics. What happened to him? Taking about the difficulties facing Republicans trying to unwind Obamacare (the Senate has so far failed to get a simple majority for several different approaches), Trump turned his focus to the setbacks on the way to Obamacare. First he recalls the failed 1993 initiative, spearheaded by Clinton during her first year as first lady. It should be noted that, despite what Trump says here, President Bill Clinton only had majorities in both chambers of Congress for two years. They flipped to the Republicans after the 1994 midterms. Trump is correct in noting Obama enjoyed a 60-vote supermajority out of the gate \u2013 he lost it after Sen. Ted Kennedy died and Democrats lost a special election \u2013 and that the Senate version of the bill passed, just barely, after some wheeling and dealing \u2013 see: the (ultimately abandoned) Cornhusker Kickback \u2013 with Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat. \u201cWhat happened to him,\u201d by the way, is that Nelson left the Senate after not seeking a third term in 2012. Trump: I have had the best reviews on foreign land. So I go to Poland and make a speech. Enemies of mine in the media, enemies of mine are saying it was the greatest speech ever made on foreign soil by a president. Trump\u2019s speech in Warsaw was his first outdoor address on foreign soil. Where it stacks up with others of its kind is a trickier question. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza gave it a good review. But his remarks were mostly panned by many of his \u201cenemies\u201d \u2013 we\u2019re taking that to mean typically critical or partisan commentators \u2013 for being a love letter to white nationalists. The Atlantic\u2019s Peter Beinart suggested that one of the big ticket lines from the address, in which Trump questioned \u201cwhether the West has the will to survive,\u201d could only be interpreted \u201cas a statement of racial and religious paranoia.\u201d Alas, only time will decide where Trump\u2019s Warsaw speech lands. But it seems unlikely to surpass Reagan\u2019s 1987 call, in Berlin, for the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall.\u201d Reagan also drew high marks for a speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of D-Day in France a few years earlier. And then there\u2019s President John F. Kennedy\u2019s own remarks in Germany, from 1963, when he declared, \u201cIch bin ein Berliner.\u201d Trump: (The Paris trip) was beautiful. We toured the museum, we went to Napoleon\u2019s tomb \u2026 Well, Napoleon finished a little bit bad. \u2026 And his one problem is he didn\u2019t go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather? Let\u2019s take this one point at a time: 1) Napoleon\u2019s story did not end well. This is true. In fact, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 is now synonymous with inglorious endings. (Recall: Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint said back in 2009 that \u201cIf we\u2019re able to stop Obama on (Obamacare), it will be his Waterloo. It will break him.\u201d) 2) Hard to say precisely what Trump is referencing here with the \u201cextracurricular activities\u201d in Russia. Napoleon spent quite a bit of time in Russia, even holding Moscow for a spell. He did, though, eventually get bogged down in the Russian winter and return to Paris, leaving his troops behind, in a last-ditch effort to save his rule. 3) How many times has Russia been saved by the weather? This might be slightly oversimplifying the matter, but\u2026 three times? (I\u2019ll update this as the historians write in to complain.) To wit: in its war against Napoleon; during Swedish King Charles XII\u2019s attempted invasion in the early 1700s; and when the Nazis turned on the Soviets during World War II. More on that below. Trump: Same thing happened to Hitler. Not for that reason, though. Hitler wanted to consolidate. He was all set to walk in. But he wanted to consolidate, and it went and dropped to 35 degrees below zero, and that was the end of that army. \u2026 But the Russians have great fighters in the cold. They use the cold to their advantage. This seems to be a reference to World War II\u2019s Battle of Stalingrad. The offensive was launched by Hitler in the summer of 1942 and while the Nazis gained a slim foothold in the city, the fighting carried on for months. By winter, the Russian counteroffensive had beaten back the tide and encircled German troops. Many \u2013 those who didn\u2019t freeze, starve or die in combat \u2013 would eventually surrender. The battle is often cited as a turning point in the war. Trump: I heard that because I said \u2013 it could have been a little slip-up in terms of what I said \u2013 I meant, for the time in office, five months and couple of weeks, I think I\u2019ve done more than anyone else. They may have taken it as more than anyone else, period. \u2026 But I\u2019m talking about for my time. I heard that Harry Truman was first, and then we beat him. Backstory: Earlier this week, Trump at a White House event claimed, \u201cWe\u2019ve signed more bills \u2013 and I\u2019m talking about through the legislature \u2013 than any president, ever. For a while, Harry Truman had us. And now, I think, we have everybody.\u201d At that, the Times published a story headlined, \u201cTrump Says He Has Signed More Bills Than Any President, Ever. He Hasn\u2019t.\u201d Hence what Trump described here as what might have been \u201ca little slip-up in terms of what I said.\u201d Still, the math is not on his side. According to both Politifact and FiveThirtyEight breakdowns, Truman signed more than 50 bills into law during the first 100 days of his first elected term. Trump hit the six-month mark with 42. Trump: And nothing was changed other than Richard Nixon came along. And when Nixon came along [inaudible] was pretty brutal, and out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress. There was nothing \u2013 anything. But the FBI person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting. You know, which is interesting. And I think we\u2019re going to have a great new FBI director. This one is a mystery. The FBI has operated under the purview of the Justice Department for decades, so well before Nixon and Watergate. Still, the president \u2013 as Trump himself knows firsthand \u2013 can fire the FBI director when and for pretty much any reason he wants.",

            "article_content": "58% of Republicans say colleges and universities are negative for the country Gap between Democrats and Republicans on the media's impact has grown Churches and religious organizations viewed most positively of five institutions tested Think the pursuit of higher learning is immune from partisan polarization? Think again. A new poll from the Pew Research Center finds that colleges and universities are the latest institutions added to the list of those viewed through a partisan lens. Overall, 55% say colleges and universities have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, second to churches and religious organizations (59% positive) for positive impacts on the nation\u2019s life among the five institutions tested in the survey. But in the last two years, there have been sharp changes in the way Republicans view America\u2019s colleges and universities. While Democrats continue to see them as an overwhelmingly positive force (72% say they have a positive effect on the country, about the same as in 2015), Republicans have had a near reversal. In September 2015, 54% of Republicans viewed colleges as a positive for the nation, but now, most Republicans (58%) say they are a negative. The divide between voters who held college degrees and those who did not nearly defined last year\u2019s election campaign. A CNN study with the Kaiser Family Foundation last fall found a hint of the burgeoning GOP distaste for formal education. That survey asked those who did not hold a four-year college degree if having one would make their lives better, worse or no different at all. Among Democrats who did not have a degree, 70% said getting that B.A. or B.S. would make their lives better. Among Republicans in the same boat, just 48% agreed. Some of the other partisan divides found in the poll were less surprising. Democrats are more positive about the impact of labor unions on Americans life, and Republicans were more positive about banks and other financial institutions. Overall, the national news media are viewed more negatively (63%) than positively (28%), but the partisan gap behind those numbers grew. Over three surveys between 2010 and 2015, views of the news media among Democrats and Republicans followed the same trajectory, with Democrats less apt to see the media as having a negative effect on the way things were going in the US, but those in both parties shifting slightly more negative over time. In 2016, Republicans\u2019 views shifted sharply more negative, and this year, Democrats views moved significantly toward positive views of the media. Now, 85% of Republicans describe the media as a negative influence, while Democrats are about evenly split: 44% see it as a positive, 46% as a negative. The poll also found mostly positive views of churches and religious organizations among both Democrats and Republicans. But Democrats were split along ideological and racial lines in assessing the impact of religious organizations. Most conservative or moderate Democrats described churches as having a positive impact (58%), while liberal Democrats were split (40% positive to 44% negative). Just 43% of white Democrats called them a positive influence, vs. 60% of Black or Hispanic Democrats. The Pew Research Center survey was conducted by telephone June 8 through June 18 among a random national sample of 2,504 adults. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points. It is higher for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "Possible retirement by centrist justice fueling discussion of possible replacement White House spokesman says 2016 list of names would play \"strong part\" As the Supreme Court unleashed a flurry of orders and opinions on Monday and allowed parts of the travel ban to go into effect it left one major question unresolved. Is Anthony Kennedy preparing to retire? Liberals hope Kennedy \u2013 who votes with them on many hot button social issues \u2013 will stay on. Supreme Court allows parts of travel ban to take effect Conservatives want the 80-year-old centrist to step down and give President Donald Trump a chance to reshape the court in a more conservative mold. \u201cJustice Kennedy is the most powerful jurist in the world,\u201d said law professor Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School. \u201cThe longer he stays on the court the greater the chance he can shape the legal doctrine for years to come.\u201d But Kennedy didn\u2019t say anything in public Monday, and the court\u2019s actions might provide good reasons for him to stay. Take the travel ban for instance. Kennedy voted to allow part of it to go in effect as it applies to foreign nationals with no \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States. But three of his colleagues \u2013 who wanted the entire ban to go into effect \u2013 think that the \u201ccompromise\u201d that Kennedy joined will cause chaos as parties in the coming days and weeks grapple with what actually constitutes a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection. Kennedy might see the need to help shepherd in a resolution to the complicated case concerning the role of the executive when the court hears the full case this fall. \u201cThe world \u2013 and justice Kennedy \u2013 likely suspect that both those challenging and defending the so-called travel ban are arguing to an audience of one,\u201d Levinson said. The court also agreed to take up a case that touches on Kennedy\u2019s landmark 2015 opinion clearing the way for same-sex marriage. The case concerns a baker who objected to creating a specialty cake to celebrate the wedding anniversary of a same-sex couple. On top of that, the court will hear a partisan gerrymandering case. While the court has set a standard for unlawful racial gerrymanders, it has never come up with a test that goes to how much politics can play a role in the drawing of district lines after each census. It\u2019s an issue Kennedy has been watching for years. \u201cHe was the lone voice at the center holding the courthouse doors open in 2004, and he was the one who specifically asked lawyers to come back with more cases using different standards,\u201d said election law expert Justin Levitt, also of Loyola Law School. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivering as Trump's promised conservative Every term offers what one former Supreme Court nominee called an \u201cintellectual feast\u201d of cases, which may be a reason it\u2019s so difficult to leave the court. Those who want Kennedy to stay on hope the next term will lure him back to the bench for at least another year. Talk of Kennedy\u2019s possible retirement has the parlor game of who would Trump nominate going at full tilt. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the list of Supreme Court nominees the Trump campaign released last May and September would play a \u201cstrong part\u201d in filling future openings, but wouldn\u2019t promise that no new additions will be made to that list if a vacancy becomes available. Though Spicer said the list \u201cproved to be a very helpful\u201d to the President the first time around, he also noted that he \u201ccan\u2019t say that there won\u2019t be someone added on or not\u201d during an off-camera press briefing on Monday. That contradicts what Trump told The Washington Times on April 30, which was that he would stick with the same list of nominees if another vacancy became available on the Supreme Court. \u201cYes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat list was a big thing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great list. From the moment I put that list out, it solved that problem. And I was proud to say it was my idea.\u201d CNN\u2019 Kaitlin Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Southern Baptist Convention leaders held a late-night Tuesday meeting The group was debating whether to condemn the alt-right The Southern Baptist Convention moved to denounce the \u201calt-right\u201d white nationalist movement Wednesday, a collective decision that occurred only after pastors pushed back against denominational leaders who initially chose not to address the issue. At their annual meeting, Southern Baptists agreed to a statement decrying \u201cevery form of racism, including alt-right white supremacy, as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d Denominational leaders had planned not to vote on a resolution about race relations, but reversed course following an outcry on the floor of the convention the day before. Leaders worked through the night to craft an updated resolution after the original text failed to gain traction on the first day of the convention. The debate began when Rev. Dwight McKissic, a black pastor from Arlington, Texas, called on Southern Baptists to formally condemn the movement\u2019s \u201cretrograde ideologies, xenophobic biases, and racial bigotries\u201d and re-affirm its opposition to racism in the aftermath of a presidential election that saw the rise of a small movement of nationalist and white supremacists that coalesced in support of President Donald Trump. Members of the Southern Baptist Convention, a coalition of churches that comprise the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, convene just once a year to discuss church business, make budget decisions, commission new missionaries and vote on \u201cresolutions\u201d that affirm their theological, social or political priorities. A Resolutions Committee chooses what topics will be formally voted upon before the meeting. This year\u2019s list of approved resolutions, for example, included a call to defund Planned Parenthood, a rebuke of gambling and an affirmation that morality is important for political leaders. Race relations are an extremely sensitive issue within the Southern Baptist Convention. The denomination was founded in 1845, when it split from other Baptists who opposed slavery. The denomination did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to repent and apologize for their history of racism, support of slavery and failure to stand firmly in opposition to white supremacy. The body did not elect its first black president of the convention until 2012; the first black president of its annual pastor\u2019s conference began his term of service this year. Like the nation\u2019s population as a whole, the American Church is becoming less white, a demographic shift that has led many denominations to ensure they put more emphasis on diversity in leadership and make worshippers of color feel welcome in their sanctuaries. McKissic\u2019s resolution, however, had been rejected by the convention\u2019s Resolutions Committee before the meeting. It would not receive a vote unless it was forced by the will of the convention attendees \u2013 called \u201cmessengers\u201d \u2013 from the floor. On Tuesday afternoon, McKissic stood to introduce his resolution and ask why it was rejected. Barrett Duke, chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, said that it had been rejected because it \u201cwas not well-written\u201d and included \u201cinappropriate\u201d language. McKissic called for the body to instruct the committee to reconsider, which would require a two-thirds majority. It failed. Few messengers had seen the actual resolution and many expressed confusions about what, exactly \u201cthe alt-right\u201d was. Still, the rejection set off alarm bells among many pastors at the convention who couldn\u2019t believe their denomination might fail to stand against new manifestations of racism and chose not to act. Dictionary.com adds \"alt-right\" as one of 300 new words After the vote on whether to consider McKissic\u2019s resolution failed, Rev. Garrett Kell, the lead pastor of Del Ray Baptist Church in Virginia, who is white, approached a microphone and addressed SBC president, Rev. Steve Gaines. \u201cThis may show my ignorance, sir, because I don\u2019t know how this works,\u201d Kell said. \u201cBut I would hate for us to leave here today with confusion about where the Southern Baptist convention stands on the alt-right.\u201d Kell was told that the messengers would need to agree to re-open the Resolutions Committee process, which seemed unlikely. Meanwhile, McKissic was incensed. He walked through the crowded convention hall and demanded a meeting with the convention\u2019s Parliamentarian to find a way for the issue to be addressed. McKissic was told that there was still a way: He could try to bring it up again at another session that night. He did, but this time he didn\u2019t come alone. A group of mostly young, Gen-X and Millennial pastors had mobilized through social media, and vowed to help him navigate convention rules to force a vote. What is the alt-right movement? \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that this Southern Baptist Convention is not going to complete with any illusion that this entity supports in any way a racist group, especially in light of the fact that this convention was founded on racist ideologically,\u201d Kell said. \u201cBeing unclear on the spirit of this is dumb, foolish and bad stewardship of time.\u201d Charles Hedman, a pastoral assistant at Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, DC, and an attorney versed in the arcane rules of parliamentary procedure, took the lead from the floor. He called on the convention to reconsider McKissic\u2019s resolution and \u201ccondemn the alt-right from the stage as we speak right now so there is not misunderstanding from the press or this convention.\u201d Standing at another microphone across the room, Kell pressed further. \u201cI just want clarity from the president of the Southern Baptist Convention about whether we condemn, as a convention, racism,\u201d he said. Speaking from the stage, Gaines responded, \u201cI\u2019ll speak for myself. I don\u2019t know that I can speak for everyone in this room, but I believe God loves everyone. I believe there is only one race and that is the human race.\u201d Another vote was taken on whether to make more time to reconsider. They wouldn\u2019t know the results for another three hours. Danny Akin, a denomination leader and president of the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, called Gaines on the phone. \u201cI think we\u2019re heading toward a trainwreck,\u201dAkin warned him. As a back-up plan, a group of pastors came together and vowed to work through the night to draft their own resolution condemning racism and release it on their own accord through social media. But behind the scenes, Southern Baptist leaders were already working fast. Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, and a leading Southern Baptist voice on the issue of racial reconciliation, took the lead to re-write the resolution. As an outspoken critic of Trump in 2016, Moore became a polarizing figure last year \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 within the denomination. Trump went on to win a supermajority of support from evangelical voters, putting Moore largely out of step with his theological brethren. But that was then. Now, the Southern Baptists needed his voice more than ever. \u201cIt was critically important to get this right\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe alt-right isn\u2019t just some sociological movement. The alt-right is contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ and Satanic to the core. We need to be very clear on that.\u201d Moore and members of leadership went into overdrive working backstage on a new, air-tight resolution. Racial unity and justice is a hill on which to die. If you're at #SBC17, get in the convention hall and stay till last gavel. After a worship service and a ceremony to commission new missionaries, Gaines and other leaders returned to the stage to announce the results of the vote three hours earlier. This one, too, he announced, failed to reach the two-thirds needed. Messengers in the conventional hall gasped. Gaines, however, was resolute about not leaving until the issue was addressed. Under a cloud of external pressure from media reports saying they had failed to condemn racism and a storm of criticism on social media, Gaines decided to push the boundaries of the rules. The Resolutions Committee, he said, recognized that they had made a mistake and unanimously voted to request something of a parliamentary do-ver. Even though they had already formally closed their annual report, they requested permission from the convention to use open time the next day to hold a vote on a newly worded resolution that would condemn the of the philosophy alt-right. The new resolution, which risked little confusion with the new title, \u201cOn the Anti-Gospel of Alt-Right White Supremacy,\u201d could be voted on the following day if two-thirds agreed to an immediate vote. Gaines took time to explain what the alt-right was and why he and other leaders believed it should be condemned. He called the vote. A sea of hands went up throughout the convention all. Organizers said they saw only one person vote in opposition. After the dramatic vote, pastors gathered in a nearby room to debrief, where they acknowledged that they narrowly dodged a catastrophe. \u201cWe ended up with a black eye here,\u201d said Al Mohler, president of the Southern Theological Seminary. \u201cWe should never apologize for doing the right thing even if we end up a little bruised in doing it, even if we stumble over each other on the way to doing it. \u2026Thanks be to God we got a chance to come back tomorrow and say what we want to say. \u201cThat was so close to being a disaster.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Out of power in Washington and decimated at the state level after nearly a decade of Democratic Party neglect, the American left is searching for answers \u2013 and finding them, lots of them \u2013 in the roiling political movements of Western Europe. American interest in foreign politics comes and goes. Upheaval at home is a reliable turn-on, as activists turn to allies overseas in search of parallel struggles \u2013 and answers. The phenomenon is not unique to the left or the right. It became an article of faith in the aftermath of the 2016 election that Donald Trump\u2019s victory signaled the arrival of a right-wing populist wave, in the spirit of Brexit, from across the Atlantic. Now, it is the Democrats and the democratic socialist left, headlined by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who are trying to draw lessons \u2013 and evidence to back their arguments \u2013 from Europe. But even then, their divisions have them looking at different potential models. For the center-left, France, with its reform-minded new President Emmanuel Macron, is a more appealing model. Among the \u201cBerniecrats,\u201d there\u2019s a blooming love affair with UK Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn, an unabashed leftist who, in the face of skepticism from the British press and his own lieutenants, led his party to within a whisper of unseating the Conservative government. Trump, who called himself \u201cMr. Brexit\u201d on the campaign trail (both as an ideological signal and in an effort to discredit poor poll numbers), appealed to many of the same hopes and grievances as campaigners, including his British friend and ally Nigel Farage, pushing the UK to leave the European Union. But the parallels between the US and Europe are imperfect, and right-wing candidates like Austria\u2019s Norbert Hofer and Geert Wilders in The Netherlands both fell flat in their races. The French right has seen mixed results in the Trump era. Marine Le Pen advanced to a presidential run-off, but was summarily routed by the centrist Macron. Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party, or UKIP, was all but wiped out in last week\u2019s British elections. Though its own leaders have suggested that, with Brexit won, the party\u2019s purpose was achieved and it can expire with a smile. Which brings us back home, to the political wilderness now occupied by the Democratic Party and its left flank. Over the past two months, they have increasingly turned their eyes toward Europe for both guidance and, especially for progressives, evidence that candidates can run and win on their preferred policies. What's a former Bernie Sanders campaign aide doing in the UK? Trump\u2019s appeal was staked to a belief that right-wing populism is the antidote to decades-long decline of the American working class. The movement that coalesced behind Sanders began with a similar diagnosis, but it took a sharp turn from there, offering a very different treatment \u2013 advocating for new social spending, with a particular focus on health care, and a broader emphasis on imposing new democratic control on institutions and industries drifting toward privatization. When Corbyn\u2019s Labour scored stunning gains in last Thursday\u2019s UK elections \u2013 which had been called by Conservative PM Theresa May as a (horribly miscalcuated) means of padding her modest majority in parliament \u2013 the US left rejoiced. \u201cIf Brexit was a preview of Trump\u2019s rise, last night should show Democrats the roadmap they must follow. The only way to beat phony right-wing racialized populism is with a bold anti-corporate inclusive progressive populism,\u201d Working Families Party national director Dan Cantor said in a statement blasted to reporters the morning after the vote. Sanders allies emboldened by Labour's gains in UK election And in a Saturday night speech at the \u201cPeople\u2019s Summit,\u201d a weekend convention of progressive activists in Chicago, Sanders praised Labour and told supporters, \u201cThey won those seats not by moving to the right, not by becoming more conciliatory. They won those seats by standing up to the ruling class of the UK.\u201d \u201cI want to tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the movement for economic, social, racial and environmental justice is not just growing here in the US, it is growing worldwide. All over the world, all over the world, people are asking, \u2018How does it happen that, globally, the top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 99%?\u2019\u201d At that, the hall erupted. Labour\u2019s success \u2013 which brought the party to within shouting distance of a majority in what is now a hung parliament \u2013 was validation, and as one participant put it, \u201cammo\u201d for the movement as it clashed with Democrats seeking a more familiar, cautious path. Those moderates will not enter the debate unarmed. Their weapon of choice: French President Emmanuel Macron. A little more than a month earlier, the little-known former government minister who created his own party, En Marche!, won a run-off against the far right National Front\u2019s Le Pen. (En Marche!, running a slate of mostly political novices, many picked from civil society, followed up by positioning itself to win an overwhelming legislative majority after a strong performance in the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday.) Macron's party on course for historic gains in French parliamentary election \u201cYou have people who were lawyers, company executives, architects, journalists, anything really,\u201d Philippe Le Corre, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNN. \u201cThese people would have had no chance to be elected as part of one of the traditional political parties.\u201d Indeed, Macron represented something different \u2013 perceived as fresh and untarred by corruption. For interested American liberals, his and the party\u2019s victories suggested another potential route to restoration. \u201cHe\u2019s not part of a left wing league in the West,\u201d Le Corre said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be called left wing, nor right wing\u201d and his roster of ministers suggests, \u201cthis is actually a grand coalition of the center-left and center-right. Nothing like anything we\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s not a fake socialist or a fake conservative party, it\u2019s new.\u201d Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, sees a lesson in Macron\u2019s march to power. After he was elected in May, she co-wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post titled, \u201cWhat American progressives should learn from France\u2019s Macron.\u201d The article pointed to \u201cMacron\u2019s vision of political reform, and his pledge to put the French back at the heart of political life\u201d as one determining factor. In an interview, Tanden pushed back at the suggestion, prevalent on social media, that she was dismissing Labour, but warned Democrats not to dismiss the French leader. \u201cWhat I think what we should do is actually figure out what works,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should take lessons from both. I just think we shouldn\u2019t ignore lessons about Macron\u2019s victory and just think about Labour\u2019s victory. I think we should say Labour outperformed and that is a success \u2013 that was a success, it wasn\u2019t winning \u2013 but it is a success that they outperformed (expectations). And Macron outperformed his, and won.\u201d Whether Macron, the neophyte with uncertain ideological bearings, can drag France out of the doldrums \u2013 and keep his government popular enough to carry out a program that could prove unpopular with the young and working class \u2013 remains to be seen. Corbyn\u2019s fate too is uncertain. Is this Labour\u2019s high tide \u2013 or is Britain one election, perhaps within the next few months, away from making a proud leftist its prime minister? We will find out soon enough. But for many in the American left, at the dawn of the Trump era, patience feels like a lost luxury.",

When you look at what the results say from last night, this nation has not moved a thread in terms of its ideals.\u201d Kerr told David Axelrod\u2019s podcast \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d shortly after the presidential election he has a forum because of his celebrity, so he\u2019ll use it. And he\u2019s used it to share his opinions of Trump, for whom he has little respect. \u201cI don\u2019t care what side of the political spectrum you\u2019re on,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cPeople vote for all kinds of reasons, right? You vote for your pocket book. You vote for abortion rights or gay marriage or you vote for certain social policies or maybe foreign policy. Maybe you\u2019re worried about this or that. And that\u2019s what it should be about. You should vote based on policy. But this election had nothing to do with policy. It had to do with hatred and fear and we had a candidate who stirred that up, and I thought it was a horrible precedent for our country.\u201d You could imagine a similar situation if the Cleveland Cavaliers had won. Trump critic Lebron James, for instance, won\u2019t stay at Trump\u2019s New York City hotel, although team owner Dan Gilbert did donate heavily to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund after Trump was elected. The Warriors\u2019 Klay Thompson has said he\u2019d probably go to the White House regardless of who is President. \u201cJust from an historical stand point to see all the history in the place and whose been through there and how long the White House has been standing and what it means to our country \u2013 I think I would go because it\u2019s just a great honor,\u201d Thompson told CNN\u2019s Don Riddell back in February. \u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with everything the President does but at the end of the day he is still is our President and is the leader of the free world.\u201d Pete Souza, the White House photographer under former President Barack Obama who has been known to troll the Trump White House with social media posts, pointed out that Curry was more than happy to visit the White House when Obama was in office. Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. Other basketball stars might disagree with the Warrior\u2019s should they skip a White House trip. Retired Laker Kobe Bryant recently told Politico he\u2019d \u201cprobably\u201d visit the White House. \u201cThat visit is more than how you feel about the current administration. It\u2019s about the guys next to you, about the flag, about the kids out there who look up to you and the United States. But, honestly, it\u2019s a tough call.\u201d The Patriots go to Washington -- some of them, at least It\u2019s not entirely clear they\u2019d have gotten an invitation after so much opposition to Trump. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. It was no problem for Trump to welcome the New England Patriots to the White House. Sure, his golfing buddy Tom Brady didn\u2019t make the trip (no offense intended), and a number of other players didn\u2019t, either (offense very much intended). But the President did get to chum around with his pals Patriots owner Robert Kraft and coach Bill Belichick.",

            "article_content": "Liberals attended the \"Ideas Conference\" hosted by the think tank Center for American Progress Some Democratic presidential candidates spoke at the event Democrats got their first side-by-side view of the biggest names vying to lead the party \u2013 and potentially its ticket against President Donald Trump in 2020. More than a dozen senators, governors and House members got their first chance to flash their personalities, policy platforms and cases against Trump in front of a largely establishment audience at an \u201cIdeas Conference\u201d hosted by the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. Here are five takeaways from the first potential candidate showcase of the 2020 election cycle: Democrats sense that they\u2019re in the middle of a drop-everything moment, where nothing matters more to their voters than fighting Trump with everything they\u2019ve got. But those who want to lead the party in 2020 and beyond know they need to offer an optimistic and policy-focused message of their own, too. The problem is, the transition from issuing dire warnings about the immediate emergency to selling a vision for a post-Trump America isn\u2019t a smooth one. The messaging challenge facing Democrats was on display Tuesday. Most speakers simply attacked Trump at the outset of their remarks, and then \u2013 with no real transition \u2013 moved on to the policy topic they\u2019d been assigned for the day. Two senators seen as 2020 presidential prospects did try, though, to offer a cohesive vision. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker cast Trump as another of the \u201cdemagogues\u201d \u2013 Joseph McCarthy and Father Charles Coughlin were others he cited \u2013 that have been obstacles to overcome in the arc of history. \u201cI want to fight in this climate. I want to dedicate myself,\u201d Booker said. \u201cBut we cannot just be a party of resistance \u2013 we\u2019ve got to be a party that\u2019s reaffirming the American dream.\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a much more Trump-focused case. She cast Trump\u2019s sharing of highly sensitive intelligence with Russian officials and his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey as symptoms of a political elite run amok. \u201cConcentrated money and concentrated power are corrupting our democracy and becoming dangerously worse with Donald Trump in the White House,\u201d she said. The ideas on display here were broadly familiar. Many of the key talking points echoed the core principles that guided Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. They spoke soberly about technocratic solutions to all manner of economic displacement. Trump was dismissed as a craven bully. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow Twitter wars to become shooting wars,\u201d former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice said to applause. Close your eyes, change a sentence here and there, and it could have been the late summer of 2016. The touchier policy questions roiling the left in the Trump era were mostly glossed over. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper spoke with conviction, but the particulars \u2013 \u201cInvestment in education has got to be all the way from birth through higher education\u201d \u2013 were gauzy and familiar. The repeated nods, over and again, to coal miners felt like clumsy lip service. (The whiplash came when Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley suggested, to cheers, that the US \u201cput every coal electricity generating plant into a museum by the year 2050.\u201d) It\u2019s 42 months from Election Day 2020 \u2013 but Democrats seen as presidential prospects used the first \u201ccattle call\u201d of the new cycle to take their best shots at Trump. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand focused on Monday night\u2019s report that Trump had shared classified information with Russian officials in the Oval Office last week. \u201cLast night\u2019s reporting has taken us to a whole new level of abnormal. The President is truly creating chaos,\u201d she said. For Warren, it was all economic inequality, all the time. \u201cThe swamp is bigger, deeper, uglier and filled with more corrupt creatures than ever before in history,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe CEO of Exxon-Mobil is now the secretary of state. Goldman Sachs now has enough people in the White House to open a branch office,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you get the feeling that if Bernie Madoff weren\u2019t in prison, that he\u2019d be in charge of the SEC right now?\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris, a California freshman who many Democrats see as a rising star, harshly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 push for harsher sentences for drug-related crimes \u2013 and accused Trump and Sessions of \u201creviving the failed war on drugs.\u201d Another Harris swipe at Trump carried racial, geographic and urban vs. rural implications. \u201cWe need this administration to understand that if they care about the opioid crisis in rural America as they say they do, they have also got to care about the drug-addicted young man in Chicago or East LA,\u201d she said. Specifically: Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Tuesday\u2019s event was an opportunity for new Democratic leaders to take the stage without a former president or presidential candidate seizing the limelight. But it was impossible to ignore the shadow those figures still cast over their party. Clinton\u2019s name rarely came up \u2013 but occasionally, Democrats did take implicit shots at her 2016 campaign. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar pointed out that Clinton\u2019s campaign did not pay attention to rural towns. \u201cWinning candidates do that,\u201d she said. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2013 a two-time statewide winner in a place Trump cruised \u2013 faulted the party for what he called an over-reliance on analytics and its focus on turning out the base. Democrats should worry more, he said, \u201cabout really offering voters a reason to vote for a Democrat for president.\u201d \u201cFrom my perspective, Democrats need to do a better job of showing up, making an argument \u2013 even in places where people are likely to disagree,\u201d he said. If this was Democrats\u2019 first semi-formal gathering of potential 2020 nominees, it was an incomplete one. To the extent Tuesday\u2019s speakers were competing, it was to define their particular styles and cadences. The room was full of friends. When Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime party fundraiser and Clinton super supporter, delivered his spirited argument about the importance of redistricting reform, his exaggerated drawl drew only warm smiles. Warren, who probably tracks as far left as anyone of the keynote speakers, delivered the most round and polished remarks. Her decision to so vocally support Clinton in 2016 seems to have won her the trust of the party\u2019s liberal professional class. But even as the politicians preached inclusion, it was, perhaps oddly, the panel titled, \u201cThe Resistance,\u201d that spoke in the harshest terms about the absent \u201ccattle.\u201d Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas warned against internal purity tests as a corrosive element that would forestall Democratic victories. He also suggested the Berniecrat call to win over working class whites was a cover \u2013 \u201ccode,\u201d he called it \u2013 for uglier ambitions. \u201cThere\u2019s a changing of the guard in progressive leadership to one where women and marginalized communities are centered. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re part of the party anymore, they\u2019re leading it. And there is some resistance among some corners of that, and you see it in things like people saying, \u2018Well we need to reach out to working class people,\u2019\u201d Moulitsos said. \u201cBecause, you know, none of us know any working class people in our communities.\u201d Sanders was not present because CAP, as a spokeswoman explained, did not offer invitations to anyone who had previously run for president. Still, the absence of anyone \u2013 Warren aside \u2013 who might feasibly win his and his supporters\u2019 enthusiastic support gave the event a narrower feeling. Democrats here were prepared to fight and die in defense of Obamacare. Activists and organizers onstage and off pointed to the Republican bill as the party\u2019s ticket back to a House majority. The language was stark. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Republican bill \u201cdeadly\u201d and \u201cthe most damaging bill for women in legislative history.\u201d Of all the issues coming down the pike, health care is \u201cthe huge one,\u201d Indivisible Project co-founder Leah Greenberg told CNN before her panel discussion. And still, the elephant in the room went unaddressed. Through a full day of speeches, group discussions, and one-on-one chats, the question of what, specifically, Democrats would pursue and sell voters \u2013 beyond preserving and beefing up the ACA \u2013 went unanswered. Single-payer health care, or \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d a demand of the progressive left movement led by Sanders, never came up. No one for, no one against \u2013 though by its absence, the message was clear. Democrats in Washington, and those who perhaps aspire to careers in the city, are still choosing caution. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, praised Warren for her \u201cbig ideas\u201d on job creation, and shouted out Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley for their ambitious infrastructure programs. But he conceded that health care would be a tougher nut to crack. \u201cIt will take discipline,\u201d he said, \u201cfor progressives to pivot to offense and use the oxygen in the room to educate Americans about Medicare for All and big-picture themes like taking on the insurance industry monopolies.\u201d There is still more than a year until the midterm elections, and maybe a little while longer before big decisions are made ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary, but the health care divide isn\u2019t going away. And like any other fight among mostly like-minded people, the longer it lingers, the nastier the eventual reckoning.

The Montgomery Advertiser reported that Brooks launched his candidacy Monday with an email announcement, saying he is \u201cthe only candidate for the Senate who has a record of proven conservative leadership.\u201d Brooks\u2019 bid sets up a clash with GOP Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Sessions\u2019 seat in February after he was tapped for President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet. And Brooks joins a crowded GOP primary field \u2013 three other Alabama Republicans, from the state legislature to the state Supreme Court, have already declared, and more are expected to jump in. Brooks is a staunch conservative: he aligned with the tea party during his 2010 election to the House, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. He supported Sen. Ted Cruz during the 2016 presidential primary before eventually backing Trump. But Brooks\u2019 conservative bona fides will contend with a raft of recent controversies.

Thursday\u2019s ruling allows all eligible voters in Georgia\u2019s sixth congressional district to register to vote in the upcoming June 20 special runoff election by May 21. Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff are facing off in the high-profile election to fill the seat of Rep.

Jason Miller, a CNN contributor and former senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, argued Clinton\u2019s surprising loss was due to her lack of a strong message. \u201cStill to this day I can\u2019t tell what your message was and neither could Secretary Clinton when she was on that stage yesterday,\u201d Miller told Karen Finney, a former senior adviser and spokeswoman for \u201cHillary For America.\u201d \u201cYou had no message,\u201d he added. But Finney was having none of it, arguing the campaign had a unified message but was undermined by FBI Director James Comey and by dirty play from the Trump camp. \u201cOur message was talking about an America that would be stronger together,\u201d she said, citing equal pay for women as one message of the Clinton campaign. \u201cI was on the campaign,\u201d Finney told Miller. \u201cI did it for 18 months. You don\u2019t get to to tell me what our message was.\u201d \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t have one,\u201d Miller fired back. Finney also took a shot at the Trump campaign, arguing it had intentionally riled up racial tension for political gain. \u201cJason, we never race baited the way your campaign race baited and you know exactly what I am talking about,\u201d she said, eliciting laughter from Miller. Both Miller and Finney were reacting to remarks Clinton delivered at a Women for Women International event in New York Tuesday in which she offered her most forceful critique of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and took personal responsibility for her failed campaign. She also noted, however, that she believes the timing of the letter from Comey about additional scrutiny of her emails and Russian interference were factors in the loss. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour.",

            "article_content": "The lawsuit challenges the length of time required for registration in Georgia's run-off Voting rights have been a highly contested area of law for years Civil rights and voting organizations filed a suit Thursday challenging a Georgia law that affects voting in a hotly contested special election runoff in June. The lawsuit alleges that a Georgia law prohibiting voters who weren\u2019t registered in time for the special election from voting in the runoff violates federal voting law. The case could affect the heated race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, who are running to replace former Republican Rep. Tom Price, who joined the Trump administration. Ossoff finished in an election this week just shy of the 50% threshold against a crowded field of Republicans, meaning he and second-place vote-getter Handel advanced to a runoff election on June 20. Ossoff falls just short in Georgia special election as GOP gets wakeup call But the lawsuit, brought by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law on behalf of five organizations, says that Georgia law requiring voters to have registered for the first round to vote in the runoff means that voters would have had to register by March 20 to vote in June. The groups are seeking an injunction or restraining order from the court to immediately address the issue. That law violates Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act, the lawsuit alleges, which requires states to allow voters to participate in any election for federal office as long as they register at least 30 days prior. The primary requirement for the runoff goes far past that 30-day window, the lawsuit says. Ezra Rosenberg, co-director of the Lawyer\u2019s Committee Voting Rights Project, told reporters on a conference call that \u201cuntold numbers\u201d of people could be stopped from voting in the June election. Francys Johnson, state president of the Georgia NAACP, echoed Rosenberg, saying the interpretation of the Georgia law serves to disenfranchise Georgians. \u201cThis is an important election, it has national implications and it is of great interest to our constituency here in Georgia,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis election is a special election, but the tactics that the secretary of state and the state of Georgia are employing are anything but special. They are typical, and that is to make voting difficult, to make voting something that all Georgians cannot participate in, and we believe that flies in the face of both the letter and the spirit of the National Voter Registration Act.\u201d The groups say the Georgia special election shows the effects of the law are \u201cserious and immediate,\u201d requiring judicial attention. Voting rights have been a highly contested area of law for years and intensifying after the 2016 election. While President Donald Trump repeatedly made baseless claims about voter fraud, voting rights advocates have countered that laws including voter ID legislation made it more difficult for minorities to vote in the election. Voting Rights Act Fast Facts In 2013, the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to voting rights advocates by effectively striking down a part of the Voting Rights Act that required any changes to voting laws in certain states with a history of racial discrimination to be cleared before implementation. Since then, advocates have had to challenge laws in court while they are being implemented. The lawsuit was brought by the Georgia chapter of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the Peoples\u2019 Agenda, ProGeorgia State Table, Third Sector Development, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice \u2013 Atlanta.

            "article_content": "It was standing room only as Lauren Cooley stepped in front of a classroom of college Republicans on a recent Saturday afternoon at the University of Central Florida\u2019s main campus. The 24-year-old campus organizer and University of Miami graduate student was kicking off her \u201cMake Campus Great Again\u201d speaking tour, an effort to motivate conservative students to embrace political activism. \u201cI know you guys worked really, really hard to make America great again, and we won! That\u2019s awesome!\u201d she told the crowd of students in navy blazers and brogues, sheath dresses and patent leather pumps, and a few red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d hats. \u201cNow Trump\u2019s in his first 100 days, what can we do to help the new administration move forward?\u201d Announcing: the MAKE CAMPUS GREAT AGAIN Tour, coming to a campus near you \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/QvcTjcUQBG During the 2016 election, Cooley traveled around Florida training activists and knocking on dorm room doors to register student voters. She had founded a political action committee that year called Campus Red, and appeared as a guest representing millennial conservatives on outlets such as Fusion TV and One America News Network. She continues to write for right-leaning media and to speak on conservative television and radio, usually as the youngest panelist and the only woman. In a recent appearance on The Glenn Beck Program, Cooley described herself as a conservative first and a Republican second. She said she believes there are others like her on college campuses, students who fall between the left and alt-right, who are looking for their people. With millennial and Generation X adults poised to outnumber baby boomers in 2020, Cooley sees a niche market waiting to be tapped on college campuses. From 2012 to 2016, the 18-29 vote held steady in Florida. And while the Democratic advantage declined in the state by 12 points from President Obama to Hillary Clinton, Trump performed better than Mitt Romney, according to exit poll data. \u201cThere\u2019s this big narrative that all young people are liberal and they\u2019re always going to vote Democrat or left,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cBut what I\u2019ve realized just from being on campuses all across Florida is there\u2019s definitely a significant portion of young people who think conservatively and who are willing to give Republican candidates a shot \u2013 but only if they\u2019re actually engaged.\u201d While American student activism has long been considered a leftist affair, Cooley is part of a push to amplify conservative voices on campuses amid what they call liberal attempts to silence their viewpoints. \u201cPeople get motivated when they get outraged,\u201d said Morton Blackwell, founder of conservative incubator the Leadership Institute, which Cooley credits with making her the activist she is today. \u201cThere\u2019s more conservative student activism going on because leftist activism is so outrageous.\u201d Though still the minority presence in campus activism, some conservative youth groups say they have experienced a surge in interest since the presidential election. Such growth is typical, especially for the winning party, said Ted Dooley, co-chair of the College Republican National Committee. This time around, though, college Republican groups are seeing more new members who are expressing political interest for the first time. Most who joined in the past already had a background in political activism, Dooley said. While conservative activists have long existed on college campuses, what\u2019s new is the intense sense of persecution for their political views and how they are rallying around that, said Angus Johnston, CUNY history professor and author of \u201cHistory of American Student Activism.\u201d These days, student activists on both the left and the right see themselves as embattled and outnumbered \u2013 a sense conservatives appear to be holding onto despite Trump\u2019s election and Republican control of the House and Senate. \u201cThey both see themselves as underdogs, but their understanding of what it means to be an underdog are playing out in very, very different ways,\u201d Johnston said. In the short term, conservative activists want to bring more like-minded speakers to colleges, fight against safe spaces and make campuses more hospitable to their ideas. To win those battles, they\u2019re taking up the language of diversity for their own ends, and embracing tactics of \u201cdirect action\u201d that were typically the province of the left. \u201cWe\u2019re recalibrating. We have to because for eight years we were the resistance, and that\u2019s a fun label to play and now the left is embracing that,\u201d said Charlie Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA. The conservative student group, launched in 2012, is known for its controversial tactics. It created a \u201cProfessor Watchlist\u201d naming professors on campuses across the country who they claim are advancing \u201ca radical agenda.\u201d Cooley worked for Turning Point from 2014-2015 as its first Florida field director, learning from its playbook as she set up campus chapters there. Since this time last year, Turning Point USA grew from 250 to 350 chapters, 50 of which have launched since January, Kirk said. About 80% of the new chapters were started by students who approached Turning Point instead of the other way around. The long game, Cooley says, is to coax young closet conservatives out of their shells and draw moderates to the right for the 2018 midterms. \u201cFighting for conservative values to be represented on campus is fighting for conservative values to be more mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cThe further left campuses go, the more moderate conservative thought will be.\u201d It remains to be seen whether conservatives will capitalize on their recent momentum in a way that swings young voters toward the right for 2018. Cooley believes it\u2019s possible \u2013 that\u2019s why she\u2019s taking her message of grassroots organizing on the road. So far, she\u2019s making appearances at schools in Florida and Texas, and says there are more to come. The tour will supplement her income from writing and other speaking engagements while she transitions Campus Red into a nonprofit intended to pair college conservatives with members of the establishment. She thinks the Republican Party could make more headway on college campuses by emphasizing what it stands for, like the benefits of free enterprise. But the current climate calls for a mix of offensive and defensive tactics as challenges from the left mount,Cooley said. Speaking to the crowd at UCF, Cooley encouraged students to \u201cpush a free speech agenda\u201d by protesting outside the designated areas schools set aside for political advocacy. If and when administrators attempt to shut them down, students should document the encounter, leave peacefully and use the documentation to lobby for policy change, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find what we can do that will actually make an impact on campus as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can make policy changes on campus you\u2019ll actually be able to see the shift in the culture on your campus.\u201d Cooley stressed the importance of advocating for \u201cdiversity of thought\u201d in reading material and among teaching staff. She suggested looking up professors\u2019 voter registration records and using that information to lobby for more conservative educators. \u201cThis is not to say we\u2019re going to create a list (saying) every single Democratic professor is bad. Some of the best professors I ever had were extreme liberals, but they didn\u2019t put their values in the class,\u201d she said. \u201cAren\u2019t you concerned that something like that may lead to some form of political affirmative action?\u201d UCF student and political blogger Sean Hartman asked Cooley. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with using the left\u2019s tactics against themselves,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have affirmative action and that\u2019s something that\u2019s widely accepted, there\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t be able to use that.\u201d Many of the college Republicans at UCF said they knew Cooley from social media. On Twitter, where Cooley has more than 43,000 followers, she defends the Trump administration and highlights instances of what she considers leftist attacks against conservatives. MILO. pic.twitter.com/aM8FwdjaAG In December, she shared a picture of herself with former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos and later denounced CPAC\u2019s decision to cancel his appearance as an abrogation of free speech. She has called feminism a cancer, declared the Women\u2019s March \u201cgross,\u201d and called equal pay day \u201cthe day when misinformed feminists spread a fake statistic making it seem like women are less successful than we are.\u201d Despite being anti-abortion, she declared herself #TeamTomi after conservative pundit Tomi Lahren lost her gig as a contributor to The Blaze after coming out in favor of abortion rights. \u201cReally tired of people tearing each other down over jealousy or petty disagreement,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we celebrate the success of others?\u201d She elaborated on her views over a sirloin steak dinner at Duffy\u2019s Sports Grill in a mega mall in Plantation, Florida, the night before her UCF speech. \u201cMy issue with feminism more than anything else is the activism tactics and the issues they\u2019re pushing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen your activism is growing your armpit hair out and painting it pink and then hating men, that, to me, does nothing for your cause, it does nothing to empower women.\u201d She rejects the idea that women are \u201csecond-class citizens,\u201d she said, especially when some can afford to take the day off and \u201ccall it their day without a woman.\u201d \u201cIf modern-day feminists were focused on oppression of women in the Middle East and issues where there\u2019s genuine differences in equality, I\u2019m on board with that.\u201d Cooley said she believes that white privilege, racism and racial bias in policing exist, but she does not think they are as pervasive as they\u2019re made out to be. \u201cI definitely believe people deal with racism,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I disagree with is this newfound notion of how white privilege is the new thing we have to atone for.\u201d Cooley said that the privilege discourse goes too far when it\u2019s used to attack those who are perceived to be privileged. \u201cI think just the way that it\u2019s been sensationalized is the reason that so many conservatives are pushing back against it,\u201d she said. \u201cI want everyone to be privileged,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tear people down to make them equal to others. I think we can build everybody up.\u201d While most of the students at UCF were there for the Florida Federation of College Republicans\u2019 annual convention, Hartman, the political blogger, said he came expressly to see Cooley. \u201cI desperately wanted to see her because of her activism and influence on social media,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree with most of (the) points of view but what I really respect is how she defends them.\u201d At least one vocal conservative critic disagrees. Tom Lauder, who runs the political blog Red Broward, wrote several posts critical of Cooley during her runs in 2015 and 2016 for Broward Republican Party positions, and said he is still skeptical of her motives. \u201cShe\u2019s copying the Kardashian type syndrome where people get famous and stay famous just for being famous,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s more about notoriety and getting on talk shows and being called a face of young conservatives and her actions don\u2019t back it up.\u201d She\u2019s heard it before and brushes off the criticism. Cooley\u2019s supporters say her intentions are pure, and that she\u2019s working to build a coalition of campus conservatives, from libertarians and states\u2019 rights advocates to social conservatives. \u201cShe\u2019s willing to do something that a lot of adult activists don\u2019t want to do, which is go back to college campuses,\u201d said her friend Kristin Matheny, vice chair of the Broward Young Republicans. \u201cPeople like Lauren are so necessary because she\u2019s in an in-between position. She\u2019s young enough where she blends in but she\u2019s old enough so she has experience and perspective.\u201d A day before the speaking tour was set to kick off, Cooley headed out to the studio of longtime conservative talk show host Joyce Kaufman to discuss her speaking tour. Cooley\u2019s desire to work on the grassroots level keeps her based in Florida working on campus issues \u2013 for now, at least, she said. That, and the fact that she\u2019s a dyed-in-the-wool Floridian. \u201cIf it\u2019s below 70 degrees, I\u2019m cold,\u201d she said as she drove to West Palm Beach for the radio hit. Cooley had just purchased her first new car since high school, a showroom Jaguar she paid for outright. She defended the purchase as proof of her fiscal conservatism. \u201cI\u2019ll have this for the next 10, 12 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an investment.\u201d Her parents, an insurance agent and a retired registered nurse, instilled a passion for politics in her from a young age. In local elections, they brought Cooley and her brother to polling stations and gave them signs to hold. During the 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, Cooley\u2019s father helped count votes in Broward County. When he returned home that night after Cooley was asleep, her father posted notes on her door with updates as votes were counted throughout the night. Driving through town, she pointed out the Baptist church in Pompano she has attended since she was a child, and where she still plays guitar during Sunday worship each week. Cooley said that when she first enrolled as a freshman at Furman, South Carolina\u2019s oldest private school founded by Southern Baptists, she had hoped to find like-minded conservatives. But by the time she arrived, it had been more than 20 years since the school had ended its affiliation with the South Carolina Baptist Convention, and she found herself in the minority. She joined student government and the campus conservative group. She said she stood up to \u201cthe liberal administration,\u201d urging them to bring in speakers like Ann Coulter and a British creationist. She only succeeded in bringing in Coulter, though her efforts in both cases made local headlines. She found the spotlight again when she protested the Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s appearance at the school and accused administrators of taking her protest fliers, a charge the school denied. The experience inspired her to continue her political activism after graduation. She returned to her hometown of Fort Lauderdale and ran for chair in 2015 and vice-chair of the Broward Republican Party in 2016, losing by 10 votes and then three. Her efforts caught the eye of the party leadership, Palm Beach County GOP Chairman Michael Barnett said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her time, but she\u2019s a rising star,\u201d he said. She formed Campus Red with Cade Marsh, then-president of the Florida Federation of College Republicans. Campus Red aimed to boost conservative student participation in the 2016 election through a statewide campaign of knocking on doors in dorms, a technique pioneered by Blackwell, founder of the conservative activist training program that Cooley and Marsh both participated in. In the @850WFTL studio with @joyceonair & conservative campus organizer @laurenacooley, talking how to make campuses great again pic.twitter.com/rrISKceu6X At the studio, Kaufman greeted Cooley with a hug, affectionately calling her \u201cmini-me.\u201d Kaufman gave Cooley her first shot on syndicated radio four years ago when she was still an undergraduate. \u201cShe\u2019s not afraid. She\u2019s really convicted,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cMost of these kids, they come and they go, and she kept coming back. I\u2019ve had these kids who are like, I want to be in radio, I\u2019m a conservative, and then a year later they\u2019re liberals on a campus somewhere. She was tenacious.\u201d Ann Coulter \u2013 \u201cAnnie\u201d to Kaufman \u2013 was on the show before Cooley, discussing whether Trump was turning out to be a New York liberal in disguise. Coulter had also mentioned that she hoped to speak at the University of California, Berkeley. Kaufman and Cooley deemed it a longshot. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be, unfortunately, more violence just like we saw with the Milo protest,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019d love to see happen,\u201d she said. \u201cShe gets to speak, people listen to her, they disagree with her, they have a debate and she goes home. But that\u2019s just not the environment we\u2019re in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Gorsuch's record indicates he would align with Scalia's views Feinstein said Gorsuch avoided specificity \"like no one I have ever seen before\" Appearing before a Senate panel last week, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch minimized the role of judges in American democracy, referring to their \u201cmodest station.\u201d He presented a study in self-effacement, sprinkling his testimony with folksy expressions and sitting at a plain wooden desk rather than the customary draped table. Gorsuch declined to explain his legal views or offer an assessment of past Supreme Court cases. He said he decides disputes based only on the facts and the law. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge,\u201d he asserted. \u201cWe just have judges in this country.\u201d In countless ways, the man President Donald Trump has chosen to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia downplayed the judicial branch and the importance of a single justice appointed to a lifetime seat. But that message belies the many 5-4 rulings in recent years that have changed American life and the reality that judges cannot always look simply to the facts and relevant law to resolve a dispute. The Constitution contains concepts, not clear-cut formulas. And while justices resist characterization based on ideology or politics, their voting patterns can suggest policy preferences. The current four justices appointed by Republican presidents vote, by and large, for conservative results; the four Democratic appointees vote generally for liberal outcomes. What is Neil Gorsuch's religion? It's complicated Gorsuch\u2019s record on a Denver-based US appeals court indicates he would align with Scalia\u2019s views as a fifth conservative justice. That would return the court to the 5-4 posture that produced such decisions as the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which lifted limits on corporate money in elections, and 2013 Shelby County v. Holder, which curtailed voting-rights protections for racial minorities and others who face discrimination at the polls. Along the same 5-4 lines, the justices in recent years have restricted class-action claims by consumers and workers; allowed more religion in public life, such as prayer at local government meetings; and rejected challenges to the death penalty. One major exception to that ideological pattern was the 5-4 ruling in 2012 that upheld the constitutionality of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, which Trump and the House Republican leadership failed to repeal in a stunning legislative defeat last week. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the decisive vote in the case, siding with the four liberals in preserving Obamacare based on his reasoning about federal taxing power. Roberts\u2019 most vocal critics at the time, including Trump, viewed the move as political, not grounded in facts and law. For his part, Gorsuch refused to explain his views of congressional authority and separation of powers or constitutional due process and equality in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. He did not tip his hand on how he would resolve disputes over a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy, a key question for senators on both sides of the aisle. To be sure, the 49-year-old federal appellate judge is not the first Supreme Court nominee to keep his views close to the vest, but he did it to a greater extent. \u201cWhat worries me,\u201d said the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein, of California, \u201cis that you have been very much able to avoid specificity like no one I have ever seen before.\u201d Here's how senators plan to vote on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch The current Supreme Court is split 4-4 on many tough issues and has been cautious about taking up thorny new disputes while shorthanded. The bench has been without a ninth justice for more than 400 days, since February 13, 2016, when Scalia was found dead at a Texas hunting resort. The 79-year-old justice apparently died in his sleep. Obama nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a year ago this month, but Senate Republicans refused to act on the nomination. Within two weeks of taking the oath of office in January, Trump tapped Gorsuch. At the same time, the President has undertaken a series of initiatives, such as barring travelers from certain Muslim-majority countries, that have prompted a flood of legal challenges and raised the stakes at the high court. Despite Democratic concerns about Gorsuch\u2019s record and vague testimony, he is likely to be confirmed. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has threatened to block a vote on the nominee through a filibuster, which would require 60 votes to overcome, Republicans, who hold 52 seats, have threatened to get around the move by changing Senate rules to allow a simple majority of senators to cut off debate and allow a vote. Some Democrats do not want to lose the filibuster tradition, especially considering that Trump could see more opportunities to alter the court\u2019s ideological balance given the ages of some justices. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal, turned 84 this month, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, the most centrist conservative and a key vote in favor of gay marriage and abortion rights, will be 81 in July. As a judge on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006, Gorsuch has narrowly interpreted constitutional rights and statutory benefits. He takes an \u201coriginalist\u201d approach, reading the Constitution in terms of its 18th Century understanding. Separately, the Harvard law graduate who studied at the University of Oxford, wrote a book, \u201cThe Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\u201d that argues against medical aid in dying and deems the intentional taking of human life by private persons \u201calways wrong.\u201d Overall, he believes societal dilemmas should be left to Congress and elected lawmakers in the states. \u201cSometimes we judges judge best when we judge least,\u201d he told senators. Two of his court opinions drew particular Senate scrutiny. In one, Gorsuch ruled against a truck driver whose trailer broke down in subzero temperatures. The brakes had frozen, and after becoming numb in the cold (the heat was not working in the cab), the driver unhitched the rig and temporarily drove away. His employer fired him for leaving the trailer. The 10th Circuit ruled for the trucker, who claimed that under the circumstances he should have been protected by federal worker-safety law. Gorsuch dissented, noting that the truck company told the driver to sit and wait for help and finding that his claim fell outside the law\u2019s plain meaning. Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota mocked the result as \u201cabsurd\u201d and pressed Gorsuch about what he would have done under the circumstances. Orrin Hatch to back nuclear option if needed to confirm Gorsuch \u201cSenator, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the man\u2019s shoes.\u201d In another case highlighted by Democrats, Gorsuch narrowly interpreted a federal law that requires equal opportunity for children with disabilities in school instruction and services. In a decision for the 10th Circuit against an autistic child\u2019s claim, Gorsuch said the law dictates that schools provide benefits \u201cmerely \u2026 more than de minimis.\u201d In a similar case that the Supreme Court resolved, as it happens, while Gorsuch was testifying Wednesday, the justices rejected that reasoning. By a unanimous vote, the court said in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts that the standard of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is \u201cmarkedly more demanding\u201d that the one adopted by Gorsuch. \u201cWhen all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing \u2018merely more than de minimis\u2019 progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,\u201d Roberts wrote. Gorsuch disheartened by attacks on judges Gorsuch told senators he had adhered to 10th Circuit precedent. \u201cIf anyone is suggesting that I like a result where an autistic child has to lose, that\u2019s a heartbreaking accusation,\u201d he said. \u201cA good judge\u201d follows precedent even if he does not favor the outcome, Gorsuch stressed during his three days of testimony before the senators. But on the assertion that judges always set aside personal values, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said, \u201cI don\u2019t buy that.\u201d Durbin said decisions cannot be \u201cso robotic, so programmatic that all you need to do is look at the facts and look at the law and there\u2019s an obvious conclusion.\u201d Gorsuch said if he revealed his legal thinking, he could be seen as promising to vote a certain way and signaling to litigants that he lacked an open mind. Sitting at the plain desk he chose over the usual stately draped table, Gorsuch stuck to his opening theme: \u201cPutting on a robe reminds us that it\u2019s time to lose our egos and open our minds. \u2026 Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.\u201d Democrats seemed more concerned about what he might have promised, even implicitly, to Trump and the conservative advocates from the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation who vetted him. Trump has vowed to appoint judges who would overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, asked the nominee what he would have done if Trump had asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade. \u201cI would have walked out the door,\u201d Gorsuch answered. \u201cThat\u2019s not what judges do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The idea came to the lawmakers after violent confrontations across the country between African Americans and law enforcement officers Sen. Scott said he has received very positive feedback from constituents who have given the idea a shot Can the racial divide be bridged with a meal? That\u2019s the very simple idea behind an initiative started by Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma: \u201cSolution Sundays.\u201d The idea is alarmingly simple: invite a family of another race over to your home for a meal on Sunday. The light bulb went off for the lawmakers in 2015 after violent confrontations across the country between African Americans and law enforcement officers. \u201cThere seemed to be this dichotomy that was growing which you can either be for the police or what was happening in the black community, but you couldn\u2019t be both,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cAnd our response was no, you can be.\u201d Lankford explained that he started asking people in Oklahoma and in Washington whether they had ever had someone of another race in their homes for dinner. \u201cVery few people could answer yes,\u201d he said. Scott said he had a similar experience, and realized that this personal disconnect between races is a huge part of the problem. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s hard to hate what you know,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just so simple. It\u2019s hard to hate what you know.\u201d So, the senators issued the challenge to their constituents and to fellow lawmakers. \u201cSunday is a significant day for most families in America \u2013 still, in whatever way with their families, or faith or whatever it may be,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018If you want to be part of the solution for race in America, set aside lunch or dinner and just invite a family over of another race, and just sit down and have a meal together.\u201d Part of the hesitation they found was about the conversation itself. Lankford said the question that came up over and over again was, \u201cWhat would we talk about?\u201d He explained that this \u201cstiffness\u201d is part of what creates barriers between people. \u201cWhile we\u2019re dealing with voting rights, and we\u2019re dealing with all these other inequities, and we\u2019re dealing with all of these other things over decades, we\u2019ve still not finished the work of the heart and of families,\u201d he said. Scott said he has gotten very positive feedback from constituents who have given the idea a shot. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how many people come back and say, \u2018They\u2019re just like me.\u2019 What did you expect?\u201d he said laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why people are comfortable with people like themselves. What they don\u2019t realize is that we\u2019re all about the same. We all struggle with finances, with kids, with spouses, some people struggle with the Patriots. I love the Cowboys.\u201d The sentiments may seem old-fashioned in 2017, but the lawmakers both insist simplicity is part of the beauty. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost anything,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cThere\u2019s no program, there\u2019s no website, there\u2019s not app for it. It\u2019s just your family inviting another family over.\u201d At a recent lunch at Kenny\u2019s BBQ Smokehouse on Capitol Hill, the senators took a break from Washington\u2019s divisive politics and replicated a typical Solution Sunday meal with a group of local community and religious leaders. Over messy containers of corn bread and ribs, the group shared stories about their experiences with diversity. Senate Chaplain Barry Black said he grew up in Baltimore and didn\u2019t shake hands with a white person until he was sixteen years old. \u201cNow how does that happen in the United States of America? But we never invited someone who didn\u2019t look like us home for dinner either,\u201d said Black, who was elected the Senate chaplain in 2003 and typically begins Senate sessions with apolitical prayers. Molly Teas, who runs a reading mentoring program in Washington, D.C., pointed out that part of the issue comes down to early exposure to people who are different. She said that for her son, who is one of three white students in his school, a homogenous environment makes him uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget taking him to Wyoming,\u201d Teas said. \u201cWe got to the airport and he goes, \u2018Mom where is everybody\u2019?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as I have to look at you.\u201d said Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, gesturing across the table. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, what do I see in you?\u201d Deborah Chambers, who works at an organization that helps the homeless, said there is something unique about mealtime. \u201cThere must be something about relationships that are built around eating, around food, around the dinner table, and we have just desegregated that,\u201d she said. For Scott, a black Republican from the South \u2013 a \u201cunicorn\u201d in his words \u2013 the program is an extension of his own experience, which is why he believes it can work. \u201cEvery day of my life it\u2019s a Senate lunch or a meeting in South Carolina, I find myself in a room that is consistently 100% white,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd when I go home almost every weekend I\u2019m having meals with my family and often times that could be all black. So it happens that I get to have both experiences, and that\u2019s how I know how close we are all. We\u2019re very similar. Very similar.\u201d For the two politicians, the idea is strictly apolitical, but some see the problem of race relations as bigger than one that can be addressed with a meal. Over lunch, Rev. David Beckmann, who is president of the anti-hunger organization Bread for the World, asked the lawmakers what they think can be done legislatively to tackle the systemic issues contributing to racial division. \u201cHaving dinner together is really important, but there are big things that divide us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe unemployment rate, the rate of incarceration, and those things take not just getting to know each other. And you\u2019re in a better position than most of us to deal with some of those things.\u201d Lankford and Scott emphasized that the initiative is about healing outside the bounds of formal legislation. \u201cLegislative solutions can be additives, but they\u2019re never primary,\u201d Scott said to Beckmann. \u201cNever has it been primary for a man\u2019s heart to be changed by what you do in a legislative body.\u201d Scott argues that bringing government into the equation could actually make things worse. \u201cWhen you start bringing political issues, legislative priorities to the table, you start seeing people drift to their corners,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you first have to do is build the rapport and credibility so that you actually can solve some of the problems that government has not solved in at least 50 years of intentional effort because it really can\u2019t be solved there.\u201d When asked if they have felt more need for this initiative since President Donald Trump\u2019s election, Lankford stressed that it\u2019s not about a political leader. \u201cHis rhetoric is not artful, to say the least, and at times he makes statements that I wish wasn\u2019t so divisive in that statement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think the need still remains. This started for us a year and a half ago or so. This is not new for us. This is not new for the nation.\u201d Still, after an election that has left the country feeling more divided than ever, encouraging people to come together over a hot meal could be more necessary than ever.",

            "article_content": "Trump made the allegations Saturday without offering evidence Graham hosted a packed town hall at Clemson University Sen. Lindsey Graham promised South Carolina residents Saturday that he would \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of President Donald Trump\u2019s unverified accusation earlier in the day that former President Barack Obama wiretapped the phones in Trump Tower. \u201cI\u2019m very worried that our President is suggesting that the former President\u2019s done something illegally,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said at a packed town hall meeting. \u201cI would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Graham added. \u201cI promise you I will.\u201d Trump made the claim Saturday, alleging without offering any evidence that his predecessor wiretapped the phones in Trump Tower, where his campaign was headquartered during the 2016 campaign. \u201cTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d Trump posted on Twitter. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! Graham also told citizens that he was going to push for an investigation into Russian involvement in the election. \u201cI\u2019m not only going to push for a Russian investigation, I\u2019m going to punish Russia for trying to interfere in our election,\u201d he said. Graham added that he supports \u201csanctions to punish the Putin regime beyond what they\u2019ve done in the Crimea. These are bipartisan sanctions that would hit Putin hard for interfering in our election in 2016.\u201d Graham, a frequent Trump critic, also spoke with attendees about his support for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, his desire to get 10th Circuit Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court and his concerns about racial profiling by law enforcement officers. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to help our president, Donald Trump, be successful as possible because, No. 1, I agree with him mostly,\u201d he said when asked about his plans to ensure that Trump\u2019s policies are implemented. \u201cI\u2019d like to get this country moving again.\u201d But Russia was a major topic at the Clemson University gathering, which took place days after a senior administration official told CNN that other Trump associates met with Russian officials while communication between the two groups was being highly scrutinized. More Trump advisers disclose meetings with Russia\u2019s ambassador \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said of Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims, adding, \u201cif the former President of the United States was able to obtain a warrant lawfully to monitor Trump\u2019s campaign for violating the law, that would be the biggest scandal since Watergate.\u201d The senator also said he believes Russia used a third party to provide hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks. \u201cThat, to me, needs to be punished,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAny Republicans here, we should be as upset \u2013 we should be as upset about this as any Democrat because an attack on one party by a foreign power is an attack on all parties.\u201d \u201cAs for the outcome, I\u2019m not suggesting it changed the outcome\u201d of the election, he said. \u201cI\u2019m suggesting they interfered and they need to be punished.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Perez vowed that Democrats would wage an all-out battle to deny Trump a second term Sen. Bernie Sanders said \"it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working\" Democrats selected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison as their new chairman on Saturday, concluding a hotly contested race to lead a battered party as it tries to channel the anti-Donald Trump energy of its base into an electoral rebound. Perez defeated Ellison in a 235-200 vote among the Democratic National Committee\u2019s 435 members who cast ballots Saturday. It took two rounds of voting to select a winner after Perez found himself just one vote shy in the first ballot. The five other candidates, who had amassed 13.5 total votes, all exited the race before the second round began. In a victory speech, Perez vowed that Democrats would wage an all-out battle to deny Trump a second term. \u201cWe are at a \u2018where were you?\u2019 moment in American history: Where were you in 2017 when we had the worst President in US history?\u201d he said. Immediately after winning, Perez made a quick move to bring Ellison\u2019s supporters into the fold \u2013 appointing Ellison as the deputy chair of the DNC, to cheers and unanimous approval from the crowd. Ellison called on Democrats to support Perez. \u201cIt\u2019s my honor to serve this party under the chairmanship of Tom Perez,\u201d he said. The results brought a chaotic close to a race that stretched on for three months. In the waning days, former Vice President Joe Biden and several aides to former President Barack Obama \u2013 including Valerie Jarrett and David Simas \u2013 made calls to undecided members in an effort to sway them toward Perez. In Ellison\u2019s camp, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and supportive members of Congress applied pressure on DNC members with phone calls. The behind-the-scenes calls underscored why the race was broadly seen as a proxy battle between the Sanders-aligned progressive wing of the party, which supported Ellison, and those more closely connected with Hillary Clinton and Obama, who largely backed Perez. By selecting Perez \u2013 and again spurning Sanders supporters \u2013 Democrats risk the backlash that could come with leaving the left wing of the party disappointed a second time in the past year. In a statement congratulating Perez, Sanders said \u201cit is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before. \u201cNow, more than ever, the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1% and lead this country forward in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justice,\u201d he said. While Obama and Clinton are bigger names, Sanders\u2019 reaction is probably what matters most in terms of whether the election result polarizes party members. Meanwhile, Perez was praised by the most recent Democratic president and Democratic presidential nominee. Obama touted what he said was the party\u2019s track record of expanding the economy, creating new jobs, keeping Americans safe through \u201ctough, smart\u201d foreign policy, and expanding the right to health insurance. \u201cThat\u2019s a legacy the Democratic Party will always carry forward,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity, and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much.\u201d In a tweet, Hillary Clinton congratulated Perez and Ellison, writing: \u201cExcited for strong, unified party standing for best of our country into the future.\u201d Congrats to @DNC chair @TomPerez & deputy @keithellison. Excited for strong, unified party standing for best of our country into the future. President Donald Trump also tweeted his kudos to the victor, but not without getting in a jab. \u201cCongratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!\u201d Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! That prompted Perez to tweet back: \u201c@keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare.\u201d Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD Perez, a Maryland Democrat who worked in Obama\u2019s Justice Department before serving as labor secretary and making Clinton\u2019s short list for the vice presidential nomination, made overtures to Ellison\u2019s backers in his nomination speech before the votes were cast. \u201cGood leaders are great listeners. You will always have my ear, and I will always have your back,\u201d Perez told the crowd, promising to \u201cplan strategy together, lift each other up together.\u201d \u201cYou will not be underutilized,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are of import in everything we do. The most important question you will hear from me is, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d In a joint news conference late Saturday afternoon, Ellison said he sees his job as serving as a \u201cbridge\u201d for Democratic institutions, adding that he he did not plan to give up his House seat. Ellison also attempted to rally his supporters behind Perez. \u201cI trust Tom Perez,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cIf you trust me, then you\u2019ve got to come on board with Tom Perez.\u201d Perez said the two had discussed naming the race\u2019s loser the DNC\u2019s deputy chair \u201cfor some time.\u201d Democrats had long anticipated the election could require several ballots to settle the contest and might drag on for much of the day Saturday. But the pool of votes that the candidates aside from Ellison and Perez would amass shrank significantly when New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley dropped out a week ago to support Ellison and then South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison exited to back Perez. On Saturday, Pete Buttigieg, the 35-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, dropped out minutes before the vote without endorsing another candidate. The move allowed Buttigieg, who is seen as a rising star within the Democratic ranks, to reap the benefits of the bigger stage of the DNC race without suffering the embarrassment of a low vote total or angering either camp by making a last-second endorsement. \u201cWe saw the potential of doing well on multiple ballots, but we can do the math,\u201d he said in what was supposed to be his nomination speech. \u201cIt is time for this process to move toward a solution that we can all get on board with.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s exit left Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown as the third-place contender, drawing 12 votes in the first round before dropping out. Television analyst Jehmu Greene, Air Force veteran Sam Ronan and attorney Peter Peckarsky also ran. Greene received half a vote in the first round of balloting before dropping out. Ronan and Peckarsky received none before doing the same. And one voter backed Buttigieg in the first round despite his having already dropped out of the race.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump made comments Monday that 3 to 5 million votes in this year's election were illegal The White House said the attention could center on large states where Trump didn't necessarily compete President Donald Trump could sign an executive order or presidential memorandum initiating an investigation into voter fraud as early as Thursday, a senior administration official tells CNN. The investigation would be carried out through the Department of Justice. The move would expand on Trump\u2019s interest in the unproven claims he has made since November\u2019s election alleging millions of illegal votes were cast, without citing any evidence. \u201cI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and \u2026 even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\u201d Trump wrote in two consecutive tweets Wednesday morning. The President wants to discuss the issue with Republican lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia and will then consider the best way to go about starting the investigation. \u201cHe wants to tell them more about why he is talking about voter fraud\u201d before taking any action, the official said. Should Trump decide on the best course of action, the official said, the move could come as early as Thursday. There is some concern within the Trump White House about initiating the action before Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s pick to be attorney general, is confirmed by the Senate. Pew study director: Fraud just doesn't happen Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes in November, but won the Electoral College and thus the presidency. Trump, however, has seemingly been fixated on the popular vote, mentioning voter fraud in regards to his popular vote loss a number of times since November. Trump\u2019s initial comments on voter fraud came Monday during a meeting with congressional leaders, where he reiterated an unsubstantiated claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. The claims continued into Wednesday, when ABC News pressed the President on his opinion during an interview at the White House. \u201cYou have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They\u2019re registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The President insisted that he wants the voting process to be legitimate, pointing to a Pew report that his spokesman, Sean Spicer, used to bolster claims that there are millions of illegal votes cast during presidential elections. When ABC\u2019s David Muir told the President that the author of that report told him on Tuesday night that he found no evidence of voter fraud, Trump said that the author was \u201cgroveling.\u201d Trump said he wants to launch an investigation into the matter. \u201cOf those votes cast, none of them come to me. None of them come to me. They would all be to the other side. None of them come to me. But when you look at the people registered, dead, illegal, and two states, and some cases maybe 3 states. We have a lot to look into,\u201d he said. David Becker, the director of the Pew study in question, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence of voter fraud even approaching (the) scale\u201d suggested by Trump. \u201cI agree completely with the secretaries of state across the country, both Republicans and Democrats, and the National Association of Secretaries of State which is bipartisan, which has said, there is absolutely no evidence of voter fraud even approaching that scale,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes voter fraud exist? Yes, it does, in very small numbers. And the election officials around the country are working to investigate and prosecute those dozens of cases that might occur nationwide in an election like this. But three to five million illegal votes \u2013 that would have been discovered not just on Election Day, but well before,\u201d he added. \u201cFraudulent registrations, not matching the drivers license numbers and social security numbers, flagged for ID under federal law, extra provisional ballots being cast \u2013 all of these things we would have seen, and there was zero evidence of that.\u201d On Tuesday, Spicer vigorously defended Trump\u2019s statement about illegal voters, though neither Trump nor his surrogates could provide evidence that any substantial illegal voting had occurred or influence the popular vote. \u201cI think in terms of registration, where you have got folks on rolls that have been deceased or moved or registered in two counties \u2013 this isn\u2019t just about the 2016 election. This is about the integrity of our voting system,\u201d Spicer said Wednesday. Trump faced widespread criticism for his remarks, including from some congressional leaders in his own party, and Democrats have alleged that Republican efforts in the name of fighting voter fraud has the effect of preventing or delaying legal voters who traditionally back Democratic candidates Ohio\u2019s secretary of state replied to Trump\u2019s tweet on Wednesday, saying his office already investigated claims of voter fraud. \u201cI responded \u2026 for Ohioans, to let them know we already have an investigation, or review as we call it, underway,\u201d Jon Husted, a Republican, told CNN\u2019s Carol Costello Wednesday. \u201cIn the past \u2026 we found less than a thousand cases of voter irregularity, less than a couple hundred cases of voter fraud, and zero cases of voter suppression.\u201d Considering Ohio is home to about 7 million registered voters, these cases constitute \u201ca small number,\u201d Husted said. The reviews, which take place every two years, are best conducted at the state level, Husted said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that federal involvement is important in this particular matter, because the states run the elections,\u201d Husted said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want federal involvement in our elections, we want to keep this in the hands of the states \u2013 that\u2019s where it should be.\u201d Former Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie-Wasserman Schultz issued a harsh condemnation of Trump\u2019s call for an investigation, telling CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that the tweet\u2019s message was \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d \u201cHe seems to be questioning the legitimacy of his own election, all while, for the last couple of months, touting how legitimate and huge his election was and historic it is. It can\u2019t be both,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the most deeply disturbing about his penchant for lying is \u2013 if he is willing to lie about the trivial, like crowd size, or the significant, like voter fraud, then what happens if \u2013 God forbid \u2013 we go to war and we have our troops lives on the line and there are causalities? Is he going to send Sean Spicer out to lie about the causalities that have taken place? Are our allies going to be able to trust us?\u201d And former President Barack Obama\u2019s senior adviser David Axelrod responded on CNN on Wednesday by saying, \u201cIt becomes an impetus for those who want to further erode voter protection for people who legitimately want to vote and are facing a series of barriers.\u201d When pushed by the media about whether Trump will call for an investigation into the matter, Spicer said, \u201cmaybe we will,\u201d adding later that Trump believes in voter fraud based on \u201cstudies and information he has.\u201d \u201cThe President does believe that, I think he\u2019s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him,\u201d Spicer said at Wednesday\u2019s press briefing. Spicer did not say specifically Tuesday which studies the President was using to support his claim of 3 million to 5 million illegally cast votes, but a 2014 study by Jesse Richman and David Earnest found more than 14% of non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 \u201cindicated that they were registered to vote.\u201d Only US citizens can vote in federal elections. However, Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, told CNN on Tuesday that his study that is apparently being cited by the White House was misinterpreted and did not support the administration\u2019s claims. A number of studies have also found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The Truth About Voter Fraud, a report written by experts at The Brennan Center for Justice, found voter fraud rates were between 0.00004% and 0.0009%. Trump himself \u2013 through his lawyers \u2013 has also argued that there was no evidence of voter fraud in the 2016 election. In a court filing objecting to Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s Michigan recount petition, lawyers for the president wrote, \u201cAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\u201d Judges have identified examples of systemic efforts to distort the voter rolls in recent years. But those efforts hurt traditionally Democratic voters and help Republicans. In North Carolina, a federal appeals court wrote in 2016 that \u2013 after receiving data on the use of voting practices by race \u2013 the Republican-controlled state legislature enacted a series of laws designed to suppress African-American turnout with \u201calmost surgical precision.\u201d The state required voters to present forms of identification disproportionately used by white people. It cut back on early voting, eliminated same-day voter registration and preregistration for voters under 18, and it eliminated Sunday voting \u2013 with the state even arguing in court that \u201ccounties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black\u201d and \u201cdisproportionately Democratic.\u201d US Circuit Judge Diana Motz wrote in July 2016, in a ruling striking down North Carolina\u2019s, that the laws were \u201cenacted with racially discriminatory intent.\u201d \u201cThe General Assembly enacted them in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented African American voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting,\u201d Motz wrote. Still, many North Carolina counties worked around Motz\u2019s ruling. Guilford, the state\u2019s third-largest county, opened just one polling place for the first week of early voting. Charlotte\u2019s Mecklenburg County chopped its early voting locations from 22 when early voting began in 2012 to 10 in 2016, with voters reporting waiting in line for three hours. Democrats also believe that new voter ID laws played a role in lowering turnout in other states \u2013 particularly Wisconsin, where Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. Turnout there dropped nearly four points from 2012, despite record early voting numbers. CNN\u2019s Eleanor Mueller and Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats plan to launch an effort focused on voting access even as Donald Trump says there was massive voter fraud There is evidence of voter suppression in North Carolina, according to a federal judge President Donald Trump has called for a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into his baseless claims that millions of illegal votes were cast \u2013 but Democrats fear it will morph into new efforts to limit voting access. Key party figures are gearing up to fight what they worry will be a spate of restrictive new election laws in GOP-controlled states \u2013 largely enacted in reaction to fears that the White House is fanning. Trump\u2019s claims of 3 to 5 million illegal votes are \u201ca dog-whistle for Republican legislators who are looking for the go-ahead to enact restrictive voting laws to make it harder for people to vote,\u201d said Marc Elias, Democrats\u2019 top elections lawyer. Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC and a key Clinton backer in 2016, is aiming to turn its nonprofit arm into the party\u2019s major hub to fight for voting access. Elias, who was the Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s attorney, is joining the Priorities USA board of directors and the organization is absorbing Every Citizen Counts, which spent $17 million in 2016 on Elias-led legal challenges to what it saw as restrictive voting laws in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio and Virginia. In addition to backing Elias\u2019s efforts, Priorities USA is also building a national database that\u2019s intended to serve as a one-stop inventory of restrictive voting measures which will be shared with other progressive organizations. And it plans to launch social advocacy campaigns around its efforts to fight those measures. The group soon plans to bring on more staff to support the effort. \u201cWe need to take a clear and aggressive stand that we\u2019re going to do everything we can,\u201d said Guy Cecil, the Priorities USA chairman. Trump hasn\u2019t provided any evidence to support his claims of massive voter fraud, and Elias said he sees the White House\u2019s actions as motivated by Trump\u2019s ego, rather than genuine concern about voter fraud. \u201cIt just shows how desperate he is to avoid looking like he got fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in the election,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were not millions of illegal votes. No one genuinely believes there were millions of illegal votes. And the President of the United States should be ashamed of himself for making this up.\u201d Elias added: \u201cIt shows how clownish he can be around these issues where he\u2019s thin-skinned.\u201d His comments came after Trump\u2019s White House said it plans to launch an investigation into voter fraud. \u201cI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and \u2026 even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\u201d Trump wrote in two consecutive tweets Wednesday morning. I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and.... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! Such an investigation would be \u201ccompletely unprecedented,\u201d one Justice Department official said, because there is no specific, credible allegation of voter fraud for the department to investigate. So far, officials say there is zero evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally. A 2012 Pew Center study found that the American voting system was in need of an upgrade, with millions of invalid registrations and dead people listed on the rolls. But the study did not find fraud. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the investigation would focus on states where Trump did not compete, but did not say why the investigation would not also include states where Clinton did not compete. And the White House has offered no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims \u2013 repeated in a meeting with congressional leaders this week \u2013 that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally. Democrats said they have seen this playbook before. Cecil recalled working on Mark Pryor\u2019s Senate race in Arkansas in 2002. He said GOP officials stood outside polling places, took photos of voters as they arrived and asked to see their IDs. \u201cThis is a new version of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the institutionalizing of voter suppression in a way we haven\u2019t seen in some time.\u201d State elections officials have said Trump is right that some voter registrations are out of date. People die and people relocate \u2013 and due to bureaucratic backups, some counties are slow to remove those former residents from their voter rolls. But both Democrats and Republicans argue there are actually very few instances of voter fraud in which people cast multiple ballots, vote in someone else\u2019s name or vote despite being ineligible. Even Trump\u2019s own legal team \u2013 citing Elias and then-President Barack Obama\u2019s White House \u2013 argued while objecting to Jill Stein\u2019s recount push that there was no evidence of voter fraud. \u201cAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. But while cases of voter fraud are few and far between, judges have identified examples of systemic efforts to distort the voter rolls in recent years. But those efforts voter suppression efforts hurt traditionally Democratic voters and help Republicans. Some Democrats have said those efforts were a clear indication of voter fraud. In North Carolina, a federal appeals court wrote in 2016 that \u2013 after receiving data on the use of voting practices by race \u2013 the Republican-controlled state legislature enacted a series of laws designed to suppress African-American turnout with \u201calmost surgical precision.\u201d The state required voters to present forms of identification disproportionately used by white people. It cut back on early voting, limited same-day voter registration and preregistration for voters under 18, and it eliminated Sunday voting \u2013 with the state even arguing in court that \u201ccounties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black\u201d and \u201cdisproportionately Democratic.\u201d US Circuit Judge Diana Motz wrote in that the laws were \u201cenacted with racially discriminatory intent.\u201d \u201cThe General Assembly enacted them in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented African-American voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting,\u201d Motz wrote. Democrats also believe that new voter ID laws played a role in lowering turnout in other states \u2013 particularly Wisconsin, where Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. Turnout there dropped nearly 4 points from 2012, despite record early voting numbers. Democrats are already preparing for fights in more states. One possibility is Texas, where the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department had led a challenge to the state\u2019s voter ID law, but Trump\u2019s administration has sought a pause in that case. It\u2019s possible Priorities USA will need to find a plaintiff to continue that case if Trump\u2019s Justice Department drops its objection to the Texas law. \u201cI wish I could say that we are running out of states that were enacting bad voting laws to challenge. Unfortunately, a tremendous amount of damage has already been done to the ability to vote in this country by irresponsible legislative action before Trump took office,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI suspect that that now will accelerate.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Experts weigh in on President Obama's best speeches, offer advice to Donald Trump There\u2019s been a lot of talk about words lately \u2013 like \u201cMake America great again\u201d and \u201cYes we can.\u201d Not really the words themselves, but how they were delivered. As Barack Obama wraps up eight years of presidential speeches, where every word can move markets and change lives, Trump has been rewriting the rule book. \u201cThe Trump election has made the case that presidential rhetoric needs to respond to Americans who are looking for a different way to communicate \u2014 how you can connect with them on their turf,\u201d said Marie Danziger, an expert on speechwriting at Harvard University. In other words, experts say, we\u2019ve entered a new phase in the way presidents talk to the people. The days of ornately written speeches, like the ones history recorded from Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Kennedy, are rapidly dwindling in a world where everyone has the attention of a flea and anyone can command their own virtual megaphone online. But despite the growing noise, Obama has left a pretty clear legacy of presidential rhetoric. These are the speeches experts rank as the best of his two terms, with an insider\u2019s view on how they were crafted. Obama first established his reputation as a powerful, influential speaker in 2008, when he broadened his \u201cYes we can\u201d campaign slogan beyond supporters and invited all Americans to share his commitment to change. He did the same in 2012, this time showing his ability to connect emotionally with the public after the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut: Several \u201cgreat speeches of Obama\u2019s presidency were after national tragedies, which struck the right note,\u201d  said author and professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania. Many of those addresses were a collaboration between Obama and senior speechwriters Cody Keenan and Terry Szuplat, said former White House staff speechwriter David Litt. \u201cTo do that,\u201d Litt said, \u201cyou have to figure out ways to use some of how you\u2019re feeling but also be able to step back for a moment.\u201d Former Obama speechwriter on gun control But Jamieson feels like Obama didn\u2019t always hit the mark. During his first inaugural address, he failed to digest a core idea into a single memorable phrase \u2014 like Franklin Roosevelt did in 1933 with, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d On the other hand, Obama did create a history-making moment in 2015 on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, when he delivered an address that many experts said rates among his best. \u201cThat is a powerful \u2026 beautifully constructed speech,\u201d Jamieson said. When it comes to putting pen to paper, those who worked with Obama say each speech largely was crafted by the President himself \u2013 especially the important ones. \u201cHe\u2019s a better writer than his speechwriters,\u201d said Adam Frankel, a senior Obama speechwriter from 2007 through 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the most gifted writer in the White House since Lincoln or JFK.\u201d Unlike President John Kennedy\u2019s artistic style, which might have distracted from the underlying emotion in the message, Jamieson said, Obama\u2019s crafting has been so stealthy that listeners could be more easily moved by the speech\u2019s content. The 44th President approaches writing with \u201chis own original, unencumbered style, free of conventional thinking,\u201d Frankel added. He captures \u201cthoughts as distinctly as possible. Using phrasing that is appropriate to the occasion, but not typical.\u201d According to Obama\u2019s former writers, the process to create a speech usually goes like this:  First, there\u2019s an initial conversation between the President and his top speechwriters. They discuss their target audience and what the message should be. Ultimately, they aim to tell a compelling story that people will remember. Next, Obama\u2019s chief speechwriter would talk with other writers about how to frame the story. For example, shortly after the 2016 election, chief speechwriter Keenan met with staffers to figure out how to write Obama\u2019s final address to the nation. This meeting was actually captured in the CNN Films\u2019 documentary The End: Inside the Last Days of the Obama White House, airing Wednesday at 9pm ET/PT. First drafts would go through policy experts and back to the President for final edits or approval. Several weeks later, that meeting resulted in Obama\u2019s farewell address, which was delivered to thousands of cheering supporters in his adopted hometown of Chicago, where his \u201cYes we can\u201d slogan transformed into \u201cYes we did.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama has always been better speaking to live, large crowds than he has been when speaking to audiences from the Oval Office,\u201d says Jamieson. The farewell speech ended up being \u201cdeeply optimistic at a time when Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters are not. They needed to hear that optimism.\u201d Experts mentioned other standout examples of well-written Obama speeches, such as his Cairo address in Egypt when he reached out to the Muslim world \u2026 \u2026 and his \u201cMore Perfect Union\u201d 2008 campaign speech about America\u2019s long rstruggle with racial issues. While some writers get \u201clocked in flourish,\u201d said former Obama staff speechwriter Aneesh Raman, the President\u2019s writing style \u201cis always pretty direct.\u201d During Raman\u2019s two years as a White House staff speechwriter, he didn\u2019t often meet with President Obama face to face. But the President did edit Raman\u2019s draft speeches and send them back with handwritten notes in black or blue ink. \u201cWhen you get handed notes as a speechwriter you can fall victim to the illegibility of someone\u2019s handwriting \u2014 but his was always legible,\u201d said Raman, who now helps high school students raise college scholarship money at an outfit called Raise.Me. \u201cHis handwriting is very small and neat,\u201d said Frankel. \u201cHis edits are extraordinarily precise. He may rewrite something the way he wants it and also restructure paragraphs that he thinks are out of order.\u201d President-elect Trump and his speechwriters are hammering out what will be one of the most important speeches of his \u2013 every \u2013 presidency: the inauguration speech. Lincoln and Kennedy are still remembered for theirs, so you know \u2013 no pressure. Twitter tips for our tweeter-in-chief @realdonaldtrump (and the rest of us) If Jamieson could offer Trump a few tips for his inauguration speech, this is what she\u2019d advise: \u2022 During the speech, identify principles that Americans all share, not ones that divide us. Trump wrote inauguration speech himself \u2022 Don\u2019t offer specific policy proposals (for example, don\u2019t get the audience to chant \u201cBuild a wall, Mexico will pay for it\u201d). \u2022 Suppress all campaign tendencies and move into the persona of a president and elevate the audience. 'The Oath' quiz: Test your inauguration savvy And about Trump\u2019s tweets: Jamieson recommends \u201cfalling silent for at least a day after inauguration, to let the address settle in.\u201d Not that speechwriters have any qualms with using the social platform. Obama\u2019s writers saw the rise of Twitter as a legitimate presidential communications tool, said Litt. \u201cWe certainly saw this in President Obama\u2019s second term, there are more and more platforms and you have to be able to not just pick the right message but pick the right way to deliver that message\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s a speech or a tweet. \u201cYou can say a lot in 140 characters,\u201d Jamieson suggested. \u201cUse this format to be presidential. Mr. Trump, find a way to do that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obama stood unbowed and unapologetic after eight tough years Obama defiantly defended his belief in the capacity of politics to empower change Eight years ago, Barack Obama inspired Americans to embrace political change with the mantra \u201cyes we can.\u201d He bade them farewell Tuesday after a historic, tumultuous presidency with the words \u201cyes we did.\u201d Obama revived the spirit and idealism of his 2008 campaign in a nostalgic, sometimes emotional final address to the nation from his hometown of Chicago, 10 days before he cedes power to Donald Trump, his antithesis in personality and politics. The President stood unbowed and unapologetic after eight tough years, an unrepentant champion of hope and change. Just as on a frigid morning in Springfield, Illinois, in February 2007 when he announced his White House bid, Obama strode on a walkway to a stage set in a huge crowd to his campaign anthem, \u201cCity of Blinding Lights\u201d by U2.   Despite years of partisan gridlock, tarnished hopes that the nation\u2019s first African-American president could represent a post-racial age, and the uncertainty of leaving his legacy in the hands of Republicans bent on destroying it, Obama defiantly defended his belief in the capacity of politics to empower transformational social and economic change. President Obama farewell address: full text \u201cIf I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history\u2026,\u201d Obama said. He continued: \u201cIf I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11\u2026 If I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens \u2013 you might have said our sights were set a little too high.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you did. You were the change. You answered people\u2019s hopes. And because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.\u201d In a speech that was as much for history as for the moment, Obama essentially argued that America is as great as it has ever been, a beacon of democracy, equality and hope. That was a not-too-subtle contrast to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan. In many ways, Obama\u2019s speech was a repudiation of those who said he raised unreasonable expectations with his hope-fueled campaign in 2008 and failed to change the tone of politics as he had promised. He argued passionately for progressive change, economic and gender equality, a strong social safety net, a health care system like the one set up under his Affordable Care Act, and a tax code that does not overtly benefit the rich.  While its purpose was to say goodbye, Obama\u2019s speech also felt more like the kind of campaign address he might deliver today, were he running for the White House for the first time. He spoke with the passion of a candidate, not a bowed lame duck president shuffling off into retirement. He spoke of threats to America\u2019s political system, at a time of dislocation and turmoil across the world, beseeching his supporters not to cede the fight to improve and safeguard their democracy, sounding as though he was worried about what might happen once he has left the White House. While touting his achievements, he painted a picture of a nation tested by racial, economic and social strains, and in comments that appeared to be a reflection on the fury and division opened by the election in which Trump beat Hillary Clinton last year. \u201cThere have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity. The beginning of this century has been one of those times,\u201d Obama said. \u201cA shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism \u2014 these forces haven\u2019t just tested our security and prosperity, but our democracy as well.\u201d Obama\u2019s address was a departure from the more traditional farewell speeches given by past presidents \u2014 it could hardly have been more different than the cozy, humble speech by President Ronald Reagan in 1989. Indeed, the grandiosity and highly political tone of the event will likely irk Republicans who argue that Obama opened political divides rather than healing them as he promised in 2008. The speech was also a reminder of the stylistic differences between the 44th President and the 45th President who will be sworn in next week \u2013 and the sharp divides in the nation which they represent. Where Trump prefers social media bursts and stream of consciousness tirades, Obama\u2019s speech was an illustration of what his supporters see as soaring eloquence, and critics brand as professorial lecturing. The President only mentioned Trump in recalling his promise to the President-elect to preside over a smooth transfer of power. But much of his comments \u2013 and defense of his own record \u2013 could be taken as an implicit criticism of the man who will replace him in the Oval Office. He decried the \u201cselective sorting of the facts\u201d that he said plagued modern politics, rejected discrimination against Muslim Americans, lambasted those who deny global warming is real and said \u201cdemocracy can buckle when we give in to fear.\u201d \u201cWithout some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, we\u2019ll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible,\u201d Obama said. Obama tears up talking about Michelle Obama became emotional when he paid tribute to his wife Michelle and his daughters Malia and Sasha \u201cYou took on a role you didn\u2019t ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,\u201d he told the First Lady. Coming full circle, Obama took his leave by recalling his 2007 campaign launching address \u2013 effectively arguing that everything he had said that day about being a catalyst for Americans to realize their own political change had been validated over the course of his presidency. \u201cYou did change the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI am asking you to believe,\u201d he continued. \u201cNot in my ability to bring about change \u2013 but in yours.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The President visited the CIA, saying he is \"behind\" the intel community and criticized the media Much of Washington's monumental core was filled with protesters Saturday Trump attended traditional inaugural prayer service at the National Cathedral President Donald Trump moved fast to mend his relationship with the CIA on just his second day in office, then ignited a feud with the media over the size of his inauguration crowd after mass nationwide protests erupted against his administration. A day after he set the tone for his term by delivering a searing inaugural address laced with the populist themes that helped him win the election, Trump offered new evidence that he will be as disdainful of convention and protocol as President as he was in the campaign trail. His broadside against the media, which he believes is unfairly representing the size of the crowd on Friday, and the sight of huge anti-Trump crowds in US cities and around the world also made another thing clear: the political acrimony that rattled the nation for the past 18 months is not going away. Women descend on Washington to protest Trump's agenda Trump traveled to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, for a briefing from senior agency leaders and spoke to several hundred people in the spy agency\u2019s foyer, in front of a hallowed spot: the wall of honor where fallen operatives are remembered with stars. \u201cThis is my first stop officially, there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump, there is nobody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am so behind you and I know that maybe sometimes you haven\u2019t got the backing that you wanted.\u201d Brennan \u2018deeply saddened and angered\u2019 at Trump\u2019s CIA remarks The gesture of the visit was an important moment for Trump, who raised doubts about his relationship with US intelligence agencies by initially casting doubt on their assessment that Russia intervened in the election by hacking Democratic email accounts. He had also spurred anxiety about his willingness to accept traditional presidential daily briefings on the gravest security threats facing the United States. His comments were warmly received by CIA employees who came in on a Saturday to see their new president. But Trump also departed from his topic, turning the event into a campaign-like appearance. He complained about the media\u2019s treatment of him and accused television stations of not being truthful about the size of the crowd on Friday. Trump admin tells National Park Service to halt tweets \u201cI have a running war with the media, they are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth \u2013 they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. The reason you are the number one stop is exactly the opposite,\u201d he said. Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared in the White House briefing room to warn the administration was going to hold the press \u201caccountable\u201d and argued that the Trump crowd was the largest inaugural crowd ever. He said any suggestion otherwise was \u201cshameful and wrong.\u201d Spicer then left the room after the statement without taking questions. The White House appeared irked by cameras that showed large gaps in Trump\u2019s still large crowd on Friday compared to the one that showed historic numbers of spectators to see former President Barack Obama sworn in for his first term in 2009. The chairman of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, told CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish that Trump was disappointed at what he saw as deceptive photos of the crowd that appeared on Twitter. Trump Inauguration chair: Speech to CIA was 'appropriate' \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate because this president is just putting his fingerprint on what it\u2019s going to be like for him to be president. It\u2019s the same consistency of straight talk,\u201d Barrack said. The spat was another reminder of Trump\u2019s deep sensitivity to criticism and to any suggestion that his popularity or election victory are not entirely legitimate. As Trump adjusted to the reality of power, those opposed to his presidency sent their own message, as a huge crowd gathered in Washington for a women\u2019s march and demonstrators also thronged cities including Chicago, Boston and Seattle. Protests also took place across the world, including in Sydney, Australia, London, Paris and Berlin. The President\u2019s motorcade passed some of the protesters as he left the White House for the CIA. The protests were part of a grassroots organizing effort meant to demonstrate a show of force to the new administration that women\u2019s rights are human rights and to stress respect for racial, gender and political diversity that organizers say were threatened by Trump\u2019s campaign. The plan had been to march on the White House but the larger-than-expected crowd in Washington clogged the planned route. At another big rally in Boston, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump\u2019s presidency should serve as a rallying point for progressives. \u201cYesterday, Donald Trump was sworn in as President. That sight is now burned into my eyes forever and I hope the same is true for you,\u201d Warren told the crowd. \u201cWe will not forget, we don\u2019t want to forget. We will use that vision to make sure we fight harder, we fight tougher and we fight more passionately than ever.\u201d Earlier, at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral, Trump took part in the traditional inauguration prayer service, as clergy from various faiths including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Islam offer prayers for his administration and the nation. In his opening prayer, the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the dean of Washington National Cathedral, appeared to be making a point about the need for unity after the bitter, divisive election campaign that made Trump president. \u201cLook with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne through Jesus Christ our Lord,\u201d Hollerith said, reciting an excerpt from the Book of Common Prayer. Imam delivers message to Trump at inaugural service Trump, who was accused of discrimination against followers of Islam throughout the campaign, also sat quietly as a Muslim prayer echoed through the nave. Imam Mohamed Magid, executive director of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, had been expected to deliver the Islamic call to prayer, but instead recited two verses from the Quran that contained clear political messages for the new president and his administration. The President did not speak at the service. Trump was still buzzing on Saturday morning after the day of ceremony the day before. \u201cA fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!\u201d Trump said in the first tweet from his personal Twitter account of his presidency. A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech! Hours earlier, he swept into several inaugural balls with First Lady Melania Trump, and the couple danced to Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cMy Way.\u201d The President told the crowd at one event that even people who had not been nice to him said \u201cwe did a really good job today. They hated to it but they did it. And I respect that. I respect that.\u201d The impact of Trump\u2019s inaugural address was reverberating around the world on Saturday. Foreign newspapers narrowed in on the nationalistic turn in US foreign policy. \u201cTrump offers fearful vision as he promises \u2018America First,\u2019\u201d the Irish Times said in a front page splash. The Dawn newspaper in Pakistan highlighted Trump\u2019s inaugural vow to unite the world against \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d One of the world\u2019s most important leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pledged to work with Trump to find \u201ccompromises and solutions\u201d on the basis of mutual respect. Asked at a news conference about Trump\u2019s address and its America-first tone, she said: \u201cI believe firmly that it is best for all of us if we work together based on rules, common values and joint action in the international economic system, in the international trade system, and make our contributions to the military alliances.\u201d \u201cAnd second, the trans-Atlantic relationship will not be less important in the coming years than it was in past years.\u201d Trump raised eyebrows in an interview while he was still President-elect in which he said he had similar levels of respect for Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is widely regarded as a US enemy in Washington. Before spending his first night in the White House, Trump moved quickly to consolidate his power and to make an immediate break with the Obama administration. He signed an executive order that will begin the process of chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, the centerpiece of former President Barack Obama\u2019s domestic legacy. The 45th President also signed documents validating the appointments of his newly confirmed cabinet members Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Other cabinet picks, including the incoming CIA director Mike Pompeo, are expected to receive votes from Monday, though partisan wrangling is still delaying many cabinet appointments. Trump issues executive order to start rolling back Obamacare White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus sent out a memo to all government agencies and departments calling for a freeze on new regulations. Some changes were already evident in the Oval Office Friday night. Red drapes had been replaced with yellow drapes. A bust of Winston Churchill had been returned after an eight-year absence during the Obama administration. And the carpet was a new sunburst pattern.

            "article_content": "An imam who had been expected to deliver the Islamic call to prayer at an interfaith religious service for President Donald Trump instead recited two verses from the Quran that contained clear political messages for the new president and his administration. Imam Mohamed Magid, executive director of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, is a well-known figure in Washington, but he had been sharply criticized by fellow Muslims for agreeing to take part in the event Saturday at Washington National Cathedral. Magid was one of 26 religious leaders from a diverse array of faiths to participate in the service, an inaugural tradition since George Washington. The event\u2019s program said Magid would recite the \u201cMuslim call to prayer,\u201d leading many to believe he would intone the adhan, the melodic call to worship that issues forth from many mosques five times a day. Instead, the imam chose two passages from the Quran with clear political implications, especially at a time of racial and religious strife, when many American Muslims feel marginalized and mistrusted. Addressing the capitol\u2019s power brokers, including Trump\u2019s family and Vice President Michael Pence, Magid read first in Arabic and then provided an English translation. The first verse he read was from Surah Al-Hujarat, in which God says: \u201cO humankind, We have created you a single male and female (Adam and Eve) and made you into nations and tribes and communities, that you may know one another. Really, the most honored of you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you, and God has all knowledge\u2026\u201d The second verse he read was from Surah Ar-Rum: \u201cAnd among the signs of God is the creation of heaven and earth, and the variation in your languages and your colors. Verily, in that are signs for those who know.\u201d A spokesman for Magid said his recitation of the verses had been approved by officials at the Washington National Cathedral. \u201cAfter the election, when a lot of things were said about Muslims, and there were questions about Muslims\u2019 loyalty, these verses were intended to convey the message that we must come together and respect diversity \u2013 that God made us this way,\u201d said Rizwan Jaka, board chairman at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society. Like Magid, Episcopalians had been criticized for hosting and praying with Trump, whose campaign included harsh language about Muslims, Mexicans and women. The Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of the cathedral, also chose a prayer that spoke to the country\u2019s divisive political climate, asking God to \u201cbreak down the walls that separate us\u201d and \u201ctake away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts.\u201d For years, Magid has been a familiar face at interfaith and government events in Washington. He has met with former President Barack Obama to discuss fatherhood and hosted members of Obama\u2019s administration at the large complex of Islamic centers Magid leads in Northern Virginia. Last year, the FBI gave that complex, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, a community leadership award for strengthening ties between local Muslims and law enforcement. From 2010-14, Magid led the Islamic Society of North America, whose conferences draw thousands of Muslims each year, and the genial Sudanese-American regularly makes the list of the world\u2019s 500 most influential Muslims. But some American Muslims criticized Magid for agreeing to take part in the National Prayer Service with Trump. Many American Muslims have accused Trump of stoking suspicion about their religion by saying \u201cIslam hates us,\u201d proposing a registry to monitor Muslims and pledging, at one time, to bar Muslims from entering the United States. (That plan may be modified to \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d Trump\u2019s team says.) The president\u2019s new National Security Adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, has called Islam a \u201ccancer.\u201d Before Saturday\u2019s service, Hussam Ayloush, who heads the Council of American-Islamic Relations\u2019 Los Angeles chapter, compared Trump to the proverbial emperor without any clothes and urged Magid not to \u201chand him a towel.\u201d \u201cIn the face of unreluctant and unrepentant defamation and animosity toward Islam and Muslims (and many other communities) by this Trump team, a symbolic participation that does not involve any opportunity to preach or make a statement does not qualify as engaging or correcting the wrongdoers, but rather enabling them and providing them with a token cover for their bigotry,\u201d Ayloush said in a statement. Ayloush also said that Magid\u2019s role in the prayer service \u201cundermines the courageous and principled activism of so many Muslims and allies\u201d who have challenged Trump\u2019s rhetoric and proposals. In response, Magid said the role of religious leaders is \u201cto share the truth and values of Islam to everyone, including those in power. \u201c \u201cDo not assume that the efforts to engage those who have misconceptions of Islam are in any way contradictory to other efforts to influence public opinion,\u201d the imam said. \u201cRather they go hand in hand.\u201d Muslim-Americans need to share their message both through public protests and private meetings with government officials, Magid said, implying that the Prophet Mohammed would agree. \u201cMany people came to do harm to Prophet Mohammed, and after engagement and getting to know him they changed their mind in a positive manner.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obama was giving his last news conference as President He mentioned in particular access to voting as a key concern of his President Barack Obama broke out the term \u201cfake news\u201d in reference to concerns about voter fraud on Wednesday, making the case that voting should be easier, not more difficult. Obama was asked in his final news conference as President about race relations in the US, saying that \u201cinequality\u201d was what concerns him most. \u201cI worry about inequality because I think if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast, and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNot just along racial lines \u2013 here are a whole lot of folks who voted for (President-elect Donald) Trump because they feel left behind. \u2026 You don\u2019t want to have an America in which a very small sliver of people is doing very well and everybody else is fighting for scraps, because that\u2019s oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified.\u201d He mentioned in particular access to voting as a key concern of his \u2013 nothing that the oft-cited explanation for restrictive voting laws of widespread fraud is inaccurate. \u201cThis is something that has constantly been disproved,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is fake news.\u201d Obama also said the premise that millions of Americans were trying to vote but ineligible was the opposite of reality. \u201cWe have a whole country of people who are eligible to vote who don\u2019t vote,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd so the whole idea that we put in place a bunch of barriers to people voting doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He added that limits to voting rights \u201ctraces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery.\u201d The outgoing President is expected to take an active interest in issues of voting as he leaves office. His former attorney general, Eric Holder, is chairing a new Democratic organization aimed to engage in the next redistricting cycle to combat another issue Obama mentioned Wednesday \u2013 gerrymandering. Obama said earlier in the news conference that he views a difference between normal political back-and-forth and issues where \u201cour core values may be at stake,\u201d saying the latter may prompt him to speak out. \u201cI\u2019d put in that category: if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019d put in that category explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise. I\u2019d put in that category institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press. And for me, at least, I would put in that category efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else.\u201d The term \u201cfake news\u201d began as a way to identify inaccurate propaganda that rose during the election that purported to be legitimate media. It has also since been used by both sides of the political spectrum to malign the other or to express disagreement. The expert analysis on voting has found that actual instances of voter fraud are extremely low, a small handful among millions of votes cast in an election. Supporters of measures designed to combat voting fraud have cited studies that found the potential for fraud is much greater.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump went nose-to-nose Wednesday with a press corps itching to cross-examine him after more than five months at arm\u2019s length, while his top nominees faced off with senators during a strategic crush of confirmation hearings. The raucous 48 hours, beginning on Capitol Hill early Tuesday, represented an unofficial inauguration of the 45th president \u2013 a whirlwind welcome to Trump\u2019s Washington, a chaotic and contentious place where graying norms seem destined to clash relentlessly with an idiosyncratic administration. By Thursday morning, after a Senate vote-a-rama effectively paved the way for GOP efforts to dismember Obamacare, new information had emerged and old suspicions were affirmed, as the final countdown to the historic transition neared its end. Here are seven lessons \u2013 and the moments that defined them \u2013 from the past two days: The moment: At his news conference Wednesday, the President-elect refused to hear a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer then threatened to throw Acosta out of the room if he persisted in asking. \u201cI have great respect for the news, great respect for freedom of the press and all that,\u201d Trump said during his long-delayed press conference Wednesday. But the lovefest had its limits, as the President-elect ripped CNN and BuzzFeed over a pair of stories published the day before \u2013 CNN\u2019s a carefully sourced report; BuzzFeed\u2019s a less scrupulous document dump \u2013 and purposefully conflated the two in order to avoid answering serious questions about his and his staff and advisers\u2019 alleged ties to Russia. Donald Trump refuses to take a question from CNN's senior White House correspondent @Acosta https://t.co/LosQWNqS6N https://t.co/oI9qWnOiRa Trump passed over Acosta during the news conference and Spicer threatened to eject him if he spoke up again. When ABC\u2019s Cecilia Vega pressed Trump on the matter, the President-elect spent nearly 90 seconds filibustering before heading for the elevators, where he eventually denied to reporters that he or anyone on his team had been in contact with the Russians during the campaign. The moment: Marco Rubio on Wednesday blitzed secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson over his connections to Russia and whether, in his opinion, Vladimir Putin was a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d Unlike Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a day earlier, Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil chief with extensive business ties to Moscow, was confronted with a blistering round of inquiries from the senators who will decide if his nomination vote goes to the full chamber. Rubio in particular pressed Tillerson with a categorical question. \u201cIs Vladimir Putin a war criminal?\u201d the Florida senator asked. Tillerson hedged, saying he \u201cwould not use that term\u201d and required \u201cmuch more information\u201d before giving a clear answer. Rex Tillerson grilled on foreign policy Rubio pressed on, running off a laundry list of Russian aggression, from its actions in Aleppo to the murder of dissidents and journalists, but Tillerson didn\u2019t budge. Further questions about human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines were met with similar demurrals. By late Wednesday, Amnesty International USA had weighed in with their growing concerns. \u201cAfter a day of questioning, Tillerson\u2019s commitment to human rights in the US and abroad is in serious question,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Margaret Huang, said in an email. \u201cHe must use tomorrow\u2019s hearing to clarify today\u2019s troubling statements.\u201d The moment: Asked on Tuesday for his opinion on the Justice Department\u2019s use of consent decrees to oversee and reform police departments with records of abuse, Sessions expressed serious doubts. During the tenures of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Justice Department has been proactive in applying oversight measures to local law enforcement outfits found to have committed civil rights violations. The department has used a tool called a consent decree \u2013 a period of enforced reform, with terms agreed by municipal authorities and Justice Department officials as a means of avoiding federal court action. Ferguson, Missouri and Cleveland are among the wide range, in size and prominence, of cities to sign on after high-profile offenses. \u201cI think there is concern that good police officers and good departments can be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have individuals within a department that have done wrong,\u201d Sessions said when asked during the first day of his hearing. \u201cThese lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness, and we need to be careful before we do that.\u201d With an attorney general \u2013 and Sessions is all but guaranteed to be confirmed \u2013 so openly critical of the process, it\u2019s hard to imagine the Trump Justice Department will be initiating the reviews that became a hallmark of its predecessor. The moment: The Sessions confirmation hearings, Day 1. While senators mostly treated Sessions with deference during what many had expected to be a fraught and tense confirmation hearing, Democrats were not nearly as vocal as the demonstrators that frequently interrupted the proceedings. Protesters disrupt Sessions' AG hearing Protesters from a variety of grassroots progressive groups and larger liberal organizations were often the harshest voices in the room during Sessions\u2019 hearings. They rose at seemingly regular intervals to rail against the Alabama senator, who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations he made racist comments to a colleague. More recently, Sessions has emerged as a vocal backer of voter ID laws. Activist Kai Newkirk, who was arrested during a sit-in at Sessions\u2019 office, told CNN Wednesday he was willing to be jailed because \u201cSessions\u2019 history and present positions make it undeniably clear that he cannot be entrusted to uphold equal justice, civil rights, or the right to vote.\u201d Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee panel were mostly restrained in their questioning, with Minnesota\u2019s Al Franken the rare Sessions colleague to confront him over his past record \u2013 deliberately overstated, Franken suggested \u2013 as a civil rights proponent. With their party set to turn over the White House, and already nearly powerless in Congress, Democrats sitting on Capitol Hill could soon take a backseat to progressives and allied groups planning to stand up to Trump with mass protests and direct actions. The moment: Both Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights hero, and Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, testified against Sessions on the second day of his confirmation hearings. Booker to Sessions: 'Love all our citizens' As their colleagues came under fire for offering what liberals saw as an overabundance of senatorial courtesy, Lewis, Booker and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond zeroed in on Sessions\u2019 history with a sharper edge. \u201cThose who are committed to equal justice in our society wonder whether Sen. Sessions\u2019 call for \u2018law and order\u2019 will mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back then,\u201d Lewis said during his testimony. \u201cThe rule of law was used to violate the human and civil rights of the poor, the dispossessed, people of color.\u201d Booker, meanwhile, sought to channel the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., when he said, \u201cThe arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice, we must bend it.\u201d \u201cAmerica needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc,\u201d Booker testified. \u201cSen. Sessions\u2019 record does not speak to that desire, intention or will.\u201d Booker\u2019s decision to so publicly oppose a Senate colleague \u2013 he is the first to do so in a confirmation hearing \u2013 shed light on the depth of the racial fault lines that figure to roil the new administration and its critics. Difficult conversations are obviously not new in this country and they escalated during the course of the Obama administration, when Americans were focused at various times on Ferguson, Baltimore, Black Lives Matter and the very visceral fight over voting rights and the Confederate flag. Trump and his cabinet will bring a very different perspective than Obama and his. Partisan fights over race seem destined to escalate over the coming four years. The moment: Democrats were alternately outraged and baffled when, in the course of a hearing with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey refused to comment on whether the bureau was investigating links between President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. The question came from Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. He wanted to know whether the FBI had investigated potential contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. The director, however, was not in a forthcoming mood and refused to comment. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say one way or another whether even there was an investigation underway?\u201d King asked again. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Comey said. \u201cI don\u2019t, especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny a pending investigation.\u201d \u201cThe irony of your making that statement here, I cannot avoid,\u201d King said, a clear reference to Comey\u2019s looser lips during the campaign, when he jolted the contest with a very late public revelation that his agents would renew their review of emails potentially tied to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. Clinton was cleared, again, days later, but many Democrats believe the brouhaha cost her precious votes in a race that was ultimately decided by the narrowest of margins in a handful of states. Like Trump, their grudge is likely to endure. The moment: In his farewell address from Chicago on Tuesday night, the outgoing president delivered a stark warning about the challenges facing American democracy while, both in the speech and recent remarks, offering a more coherent path forward than anyone else in his party. Obama said goodbye in much the same way he entered national politics \u2013 with an appeal to a shared decency and common interests across the partisan divide. But a decade on from the beginning of his brief Senate stay, the twice-elected president addressed a country more openly at odds over race. Watch President Obama's full farewell address \u201cAfter my election,\u201d Obama told supporters in McCormick Place, \u201cthere was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d Framing that divide as a \u201cthreat to our democracy,\u201d Obama pleaded with Americans to emerge from their digital bubbles and more openly engage with political opposites. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet,\u201d he said to laughs, \u201ctry talking with one of them in real life.\u201d But his appeal to economic solidarity \u2013 which sounded a lot more like Bernie Sanders than his would-be successor Hillary Clinton \u2013 struck hardest. \u201cIf every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,\u201d he said, while pointedly encouraging Democrats to engage \u201cthe middle-aged white guy.\u201d Whether that adds up to a winning strategy remains to be seen, but for a night at least, the departing Obama towered over the Democrats he leaves behind to take on Trump.",

            "article_content": "Trump's AG nominee comes under scrutiny in Senate hearing President Obama left Washington to say farewell in Chicago In Washington, the next attorney general insisted at his confirmation hearing that he is not a racist. And in Chicago, the nation\u2019s first black president offered a fiery farewell \u2013 and a warning. Speaking to emotional supporters in Chicago, President Barack Obama described racial animus in America, persistent and pervasive, as a \u201cthreat to our democracy.\u201d \u201cAfter my election,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d The weight and implacability of those divisions were on display back in Washington, where Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, denied a federal judgeship more than 30 years ago amid charges he called a black colleague \u201cboy\u201d and hinted at past sympathy for the Ku Klux Klan, sought to disarm critics on Capitol Hill. Sessions will face criticism during a second day of scrutiny, including from Sen. Cory Booker, who is taking the unprecedented step of testifying against his colleague. As Obama touched down in Chicago, where he had been working as a community organizer the last time Sessions faced the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Alabama senator in his opening remarks dismissed the allegations that scuttled his 1986 nomination as \u201cdamnably false.\u201d \u201cI abhor the Klan and what it represents, and its hateful ideology,\u201d Sessions said in his opening remarks Tuesday, touting his role in the investigation, conviction and eventual execution of a KKK member who took part in the 1981 lynching of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile, Alabama. As Sessions looked back, seeking to recast a lifetime on the fault lines of the American racial divide, Obama offered what administration officials had promised would be a \u201cforward-looking\u201d vision for Americans, in particular the loyal liberals who supported him and, in 2016, Hillary Clinton. President Obama farewell address: full text \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be serious about race, we must uphold laws against discrimination \u2013 in hiring, in housing, in education and the criminal justice system,\u201d Obama said to roars in McCormick Place. \u201cThat\u2019s what our Constitution and highest ideals require. But laws alone won\u2019t be enough. Hearts must change.\u201d Back in Washington, Sessions had sought to soften his public image. He appeared at the outset with young grandchildren on his lap. Asked by the sympathetic Sen. Lindsey Graham how being accused of racism made him feel, Sessions cast his younger self as the naive victim of a ruthless smear campaign. \u201cWhen you have a Southern name, you come from South Alabama that sounds worse to some people,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhen I came up as a US attorney, I had no real support group. I did not prepare myself well in 1986 and there was an organized effort to caricature me as something that was not true. And, it was very painful. I didn\u2019t know how to response and didn\u2019t respond very well.\u201d Sessions survived. He was rejected by the Senate then, but was elected to it later. For his years there, he seemed to enjoy an unlikely deference, and not only from Republicans. Apart from a few sharp exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, who suggested the nominee had overstated and misled the public about his civil rights record, his colleagues pushed but never sought a knockout blow. Over the hours, Sessions hardened. Presented with evidence of compromising relationships with known bigots like anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney Jr., the senator pleaded ignorance. Later on in Tuesday\u2019s hearing he expressed skepticism over the use of federal consent decrees to address police abuses. \u201cThese lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be careful before we do that.\u201d But even as the hearing oscillated between skeptical, if restrained, Democrats and approving Republicans, a Greek chorus of protesters and stood up at regular intervals to shout down the nominee. Groups of demonstrators, many from Code Pink, chanted \u201cNo Trump, No KKK, no fascist USA,\u201d as security escorted them out. Another yelled, \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d as activists nearby crowded inside Sessions\u2019 own office, demanding the senator withdraw his name. The first from the upper chamber to back President-elect Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, Sessions\u2019 record as a lawmaker and prosecutor has come under intense scrutiny by the press and political opponents. His path to becoming the nation\u2019s most powerful law enforcement officer has been sharply contested by a range of progressive groups, ranging from grassroots activists to established organizations like the NAACP and ACLU, whose national legal director, David Cole, will testify during the second round of hearings on Wednesday. Colleague, transcripts offer closer look at old allegations of racism against Sen. Jeff Sessions Sessions\u2019 judgeship was sunk in part because he referred to those groups\u2019 work as potentially \u201cun-American.\u201d On Tuesday he argued that the remark was made in an effort to aid and preserve the NAACP\u2019s \u201cmoral authority.\u201d \u201cMy comment about the NAACP arose from a discussion I had where I expressed concern about their statements that were favoring, as I saw it, Sandinista efforts and communist guerrilla efforts in Central America,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAnd so I said they could be perceived as \u2018un-American\u2019 and weaken their moral authority to achieve the great things they had been accomplishing in integration and moving forward for reconciliation throughout the country.\u201d",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jill Filipovic: Louise Linton is not an elected official, and how she spends her money is her own business Linton's actions are the latest example of ever-coarsening behavior online from the nation's privileged, Filipovic says It\u2019s tough out there for a socialite. Especially when money can\u2019t buy you good sense. Louise Linton, an actress recently married to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is facing criticism for an ill-conceived social media encounter that first involved her bragging about her designer wardrobe, and quickly devolved into her mocking and berating an Oregon mom. She posted a photo to Instagram of herself having just exited an official government plane, and included a series of hashtags to specify exactly which pricey designer brands she was wearing. When Jennifer Miller, an Oregon mother of three, criticized her (\u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable\u201d), Linton struck back. \u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u2018trip\u2019 than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.\u201d She later apologized in a statement. Liberals were aghast. Some conservatives shrugged, or said nothing. Breitbart gave the story a cursory writeup, and the Twitter chatter about it has been dominated by liberal pundits while conservatives have stayed largely silent. The right passed up the opportunity to side with someone who represents the working and middle class that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign supposedly championed against the arrogance of the entitled rich. Instead this encounter is another piece of evidence that we can now put a bullet in the idea that most people who voted for Donald Trump did so because of economic insecurity; for many, it\u2019s clearly about a more complex, ugly form of political and racial tribalism. The response from the right (or lack thereof) to Linton\u2019s outburst is more evidence that the 2016 election wasn\u2019t just about white working-class voters feeling unrepresented by out-of-touch elites. It was also about a group of Americans who don\u2019t care one iota about character or honesty or even reality, but do care about sticking it to liberals and creating chaos for fun \u2013 because liberals, and the people increasingly benefiting from the changing political order, are women and people of color. Treasury secretary's wife apologizes for Instagram post, reply To be clear, Linton is not an elected official, and how she spends her money is her own business, whether it\u2019s on Birkin bags and Valentino heels or perhaps copies of her own bizarrely self-aggrandizing book, which peddles racist clich\u00e9s about Africa and has been thoroughly discredited. There is also something particularly sexist about the vitriol aimed at women who wear pricey clothing, since that outrage is rarely leveled at men who have closets full of $10,000 suits. But Linton\u2019s actions are only the latest example of ever-coarsening behavior online from the nation\u2019s most privileged and entitled, coupled with stunning conservative hypocrisy. The combination of Linton\u2019s Africa memoir, her tacky name-dropping hashtags, and her condescending and classist response to Miller paints a portrait of a self-involved and narcissistic woman with a loose relationship to the truth and very little self-awareness. There seems to be no hypocrisy a startling number of GOP voters won\u2019t tolerate, and no point at which an individual\u2019s cronyism, lies and ill character matter if there\u2019s an R next to their name on the ballot. Trump promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and advocate for the average working man; instead, he\u2019s appointed bankers like Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, to the richest Cabinet in history, and along with those millionaires and billionaires is pushing policies that would devastate the poor. Trump tarred his opponent as hopelessly corrupt, and Clinton\u2019s emails got top media billing at his rallies and in media coverage; many of Trump\u2019s supporters cited \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d as a reason they were voting for him. And yet as president, Trump has taken nepotism to new extremes and demonstrated a shocking and unprecedented willingness to abuse his position in order to enrich himself and his family. He put his daughter and her husband in plum positions, ignored the fact that his son met with a Russian operative to get dirt on Clinton, and profits handsomely from the hotels and clubs he owns \u2013 and that others pay to stay at so they can get access to the president. If Republican voters and their elected officials in Congress are bothered, they aren\u2019t saying so.  The bad behavior of the Republican at the top of the ticket seems to be trickling down not just to the rest of his administration, but to Americans more generally. It\u2019s poisoning out politics, it\u2019s making us dumber, and it seems to be feeding many of our worst impulses. Linton is just one incarnation of this disturbing trend: A woman who seems better suited to star on a reality TV show than to be a public political figure who is tied (even if only by marriage) to public service; a narcissistic fabulist with bad social media manners who lashes out at the less powerful who dare criticize her.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and current counsel at the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. The ferocity of President Donald Trump\u2019s recent attacks on the integrity of the FBI has sent shock waves through an agency accustomed to public adulation in recent years. Sadly, much of the presidential criticism of the bureau may be entirely legitimate. The FBI has traditionally enjoyed a highly favorable reputation among a majority of the nation\u2019s citizens. Despite controversial programs that sometimes employed illegal forms of surveillance and enforcement methods \u2013 such as those used on black citizens lawfully protesting racial segregation, individuals in the \u201cred scare\u201d of the 1950s and long-haired students and others protesting the war in Vietnam during the 1960s and \u201970s \u2013 this reputation endured. And American presidents continued to steadfastly defend the bureau \u2013 that is, until now. The tradition of presidential support was unquestionably grounded at least partially in the fear of J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s rumored 50-year political skeleton \u201cdossier,\u201d which would undoubtedly make the controversial \u201cSteele dossier\u201d look like child\u2019s play. But Hoover is gone now, and President Trump\u2019s persistent attacks have the potential to inflict long-lasting reputational damage to the nation\u2019s preeminent law enforcement agency. These criticisms focus largely on FBI fumbles and missteps in the Hillary Clinton and Trump/Russia investigations, which the President suggests were deliberate attempts to sabotage his election and administration.  Trump supporters and possibly the President himself say they see the workings of a conspiratorial \u201cdeep state\u201d liberal-embedded bureaucracy fiercely resisting any conservative change. Sources: FBI deputy director to retire Some of Trump\u2019s recent criticisms of the agency relate to the alleged activities of FBI special agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. An investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general revealed that the two exchanged text messages strongly indicative of anti-Trump and pro-Clinton bias while Strzok played a critical role in the Clinton investigation and a subsequent lesser role in Mueller\u2019s Trump/Russia probe. (A CNN reporter, in a news article after the text message controversy erupted, wrote that an attorney for Strzok did not respond to a request for comment, and Page could not be reached for comment.) In addition, the President continues to call the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and to castigate the agency\u2019s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, for alleged \u201cbias\u201d and incompetence. Last Saturday, the President tweeted that former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired, is a \u201cliar\u201d and called him \u201cleakin\u2019 James Comey.\u201d Trump also issued a clearly derogatory \u201cWow\u201d comment regarding the unexplained reassignment of the FBI\u2019s general counsel, James Baker, reportedly a close friend of Comey\u2019s. The President may have been angered by reports that McCabe was backing Comey\u2019s claim that the President made a loyalty demand and requested leniency for his former national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, who is now a convicted felon awaiting sentencing under federal indictment. When news of the text messages between Strzok and Page came to light against the backdrop of claimed McCabe improprieties, it became harder to just dismiss all of Trump\u2019s FBI conspiracy claims as delusional \u2013 though many of his critics do. Strzok was one of the FBI\u2019s top counterintelligence agents supervising the investigation of Clinton\u2019s controversial email problems. He subsequently joined Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump/Russia investigation, and the question lingers as to why his obvious anti-Trump prejudice was not uncovered in his job interview for the position with Mueller. Why didn\u2019t McCabe warn Mueller of Strzok\u2019s likely bias, which he should have known from his own day-to-day conversations with Page and Strzok at FBI headquarters?  Page reportedly worked for McCabe, who certainly also had frequent contact with Strzok \u2013 again, the FBI\u2019s No. 2 counterintelligence agent. This assessment is admittedly speculative, but it is speculation grounded in common sense. Fact check: Trump wrong on Andrew McCabe Strzok was abruptly removed from the Mueller investigation in mid-summer of 2017.  It seems that he had exchanged a series of 375 text messages with Page, clearly documenting their joint revulsion at all things Trump. The President is variously described as a \u201cloathsome human,\u201d an \u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201cd*uche,\u201d while they describe the prospects of the President\u2019s election as \u201cterrifying.\u201d The shocking aspect of the Strzok/Page discussions about the \u201cterrifying\u201d possibility of Trump\u2019s election is that some of those discussions may have taken place, according to one of Strzok\u2019s texts in \u201cAndy\u2019s Office.\u201d CNN has reported that the text was presumably referring to the office of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe in August of 2016. Page had previously opined, according to the texts: \u201cThere\u2019s no way he gets elected.\u201d Strzok, however, texted that even if Trump\u2019s election is a long shot, \u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s office \u2026that there\u2019s no way he gets elected \u2013 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40.\u201d The most benevolent interpretation of this Strzok statement, as suggested by The Wall Street Journal, is that Strzok was advocating a fast and aggressive pursuit of the Russia investigation  \u201cbecause some of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates could land administration jobs and it was important to know if they had colluded with Russia,\u201d according to the Journal\u2019s story. Trump rips Sessions over acting FBI director But there is more. Strzok was the FBI agent who changed the language used by former Director Comey in his controversial July 5, 2016, public statement clearing Clinton of criminal charges regarding her handling of classified materials. Strzok changed the final draft wording of Comey\u2019s statement from \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d (which is commonly used in criminal cases) to the softer, non-criminal \u201cextremely careless\u201d wording. Trump supporters would point to this as evidence that Strzok, the FBI\u2019s No. 2 counterintelligence agent, appears to be executing a plan within the FBI to clear Clinton and then destroy Trump\u2019s candidacy with the Russia investigation. Causing further headaches for FBI brass, we now know that Deputy Director McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill McCabe, an unsuccessful Democratic 2015 candidate for the state senate in Virginia, had received approximately $700,000 in campaign contributions from then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s political action committee and the state\u2019s Democratic Party.  While this didn\u2019t violate any laws or FBI protocols, the association looks unseemly for an agency conducting an investigation with potentially historic implications. McAuliffe had been the campaign chairman of Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and has been described by onlookers as being \u201cas close as family\u201d to the Clintons. While McCabe\u2019s wife certainly has a right to run for office, her acceptance of hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from sources with clear links to the Clintons was a red-flag warning that should have caused McCabe to recuse himself from any involvement in any Trump/Hillary related investigations.  He had no business calling any of the shots in these sensitive probes that would likely influence the outcome of the presidential election. The FBI has stated that that McCabe acted in accordance with stated agency protocols while his wife was running for office. McCabe could corroborate Comey 'loyalty pledge' story McCabe remains a very important figure in the unfolding Mueller investigation; the latest reports are that McCabe may be a key witness backing Comey\u2019s claim that the President had improperly asked him to terminate the Flynn investigation. McCabe\u2019s credibility, however, may now be compromised by the facts and circumstances regarding Strzok\u2019s text messages, the meetings in \u201cAndy\u2019s Office\u201d and the political contributions given to McCabe\u2019s wife. While I rarely agree with much of what the President does or says regarding legal issues, this time he\u2019s got it right. The FBI\u2019s reputation has been severely damaged not by the President\u2019s criticism but by a systematic failure of the bureau\u2019s leadership. The field agents of the FBI should still retain the trust of the American people. Their honor and dignity has not been compromised; but the bureau\u2019s leadership ranks require a prompt and thorough house cleaning by the new director, Christopher Wray.  The bureau\u2019s leadership has forfeited the reputation of a cherished American institution.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Hossein Derakhshan is a writer and researcher on the socio-political impacts of new media technologies who spent six years in prison in Iran over his blog. They recently co-authored a report, \u201cInformation Disorder,\u201d commissioned by the Council of Europe. Claire Wardle is a research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, and leads the non-profit First Draft. The opinions in this article belong to the authors. When we use the term \u201cfake news\u201d it is not only self-defeating, it oversimplifies a very complex problem. A year ago, this wasn\u2019t the case. The term actually meant something. It described a particular type of website that used the same design templates as professional news websites but its contents were entirely fabricated. But earlier this year, the term started to become meaningless. It became used to describe any piece of information that someone else didn\u2019t like. Increasingly the term has become weaponized by politicians who use it to undermine independent journalism in an effort to reach the public directly through their own channels. This is not just a US phenomenon. Research by the Columbia Journalism Review shows that people in three other countries increasingly believe that the \u201cmainstream\u201d media peddle fabricated stories. In countries where a free press is a luxury and free speech is not guaranteed, this phrase is being used as an excuse to clamp down on both. Terminology matters, and using it simply \u201cbecause everyone else uses it\u201d is no longer good enough. The term is also woefully inadequate for describing the complexity of the situation. When we think about the Facebook posts created by Russian accounts during the US election, would we consider them news? What about the image of a shark swimming up a Texas highway during Hurricane Harvey? That shark was real, but it was not in Houston during that hurricane. We live in a time when our information streams are polluted and there are many different types of information. They move and shift. Some types are visible; others are harder to spot. Some we would all agree are problematic \u2013 manipulated images created during a breaking news event, for example, designed to confuse and to hoax. But what about satirical news websites? What about misleading headlines designed solely to drive traffic? We need to rethink our vocabulary. In our recent report, \u201cInformation Disorder,\u201d commissioned by the Council of Europe and published by Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center, we proposed three different terms as a way to think and talk about this issue. Misinformation is when there is an unintentional mistake, such as the poor use of statistics or quotes, or when an old image resurfaces (for example when people shared the shark photo mentioned above). Disinformation is when false or manipulated information or imagery is deliberately used to do harm to someone. (The Facebook ads created by Russia and targeted at US voters during the presidential election would be an example of this). Malinformation is when genuine information is used to cause harm to someone (for example revenge porn). Rumors, conspiracy theories and fabricated information are nothing new. As Sun Tzu explained 25 centuries ago, \u201call warfare is based on deception.\u201d False information is a part of our lives, whether it is individuals lying to save face or prevent hurt feelings, politicians making unrealistic promises during election campaigns, corporations using false claims to damage their competitors or the media disseminating misleading stories to gain a wider audience. However, social media has added an entirely new dimension to the phenomenon, most significantly because the power dynamics have changed. Now anyone in the world can easily create and disseminate false information, and with the help of bots, organized groups, or targeted ads, it is easy to amplify it. Given how social media have made our information consumption a public performance for our audience, it is now even less likely for most people to swim against the tide and challenge each other. In our increasingly lonely lives, who would want to feel lonelier? Does a free press mean more regulation for Facebook? Recent revelations about foreign meddling in the US elections have exposed the fact that we\u2019re targets in an active information war. Previously these types of campaigns were fought via sophisticated and expensive communication technologies, such as short-wave radio or  transnational satellite television. Now significantly less powerful agents can harm large institutions or established individuals with few resources. It is asymmetrical warfare. There are two new and unique aspects of social media which have changed the game: Firstly, disinformation can be cheaply amplified through committed volunteers, paid agents or bots. Secondly, our information sources are becoming increasingly social, and therefore much more visual, emotional, and performative. And as trust in institutions decreases, people are turning to their closest networks of family and friends for information. This has created a perfect environment for the spread of disinformation around the world. There are significant and long-term concerns. Social media has become the most powerful vehicle for politicians around the world to undermine traditional media, thereby damaging  the very foundation of the idea of representative democracy: informed voters. Ask the tough questions The combination of social media and television is a hotbed for sensational politicians who benefit from populations polarized by political, economic, religious, racial or ethnic divisions. Sophisticated methods \u2013 especially the use of micro-targeted advertising via social media \u2013 must be considered as a recipe for electoral success around the world. So what can be done? The truth is that there are no easy solutions. These trends are the symptoms of significant social and economic shifts globally. But ultimately, it is only logic and critical thinking which could save us from the trap of manipulation. Research shows the more educated people are, the less likely they are to be affected by information warfare. Technologists, policy-makers, and researchers are working hard to find short-term solutions. However, none of these will have a long-term effect if we don\u2019t overhaul public education, especially regarding information literacy.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. A general's eloquent condemnation of hatred is the message that President Trump should be delivering, writes Frida Ghitis After Charlottesville, Trump spurned the perfect opportunity to condemn bigotry in forceful and unambiguous tones It is the speech\u00a0we wish the President of the United States had delivered. Alas, it fell to an Air Force general to remind America of its values. His rank may be lower than the commander in chief\u2019s, but Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria spoke with extraordinary passion and eloquence. Everyone in America should listen to Silveria\u2019s words; everyone, including the President. It happened on Thursday, at the 10th\u00a0Air Base Wing in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Silveria, the superintendent of the US Air Force Academy, brought together\u00a0more than 5,000 students, staff and Air Force officers to tell them with electrifying clarity that prejudice, bigotry and intolerance cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. Air Force academy head to racists: 'Get out' Someone had written racist slurs on a message board at the academy\u2019s prep school, where students hone the skills to join the prestigious Air Force Academy. If his audience had not heard about the incident, Silveria wanted to make sure they knew.\u00a0(Update: On Nov. 7, the Air Force Academy revealed the incident was a hoax, after its investigation found the racist graffiti was written by an African-American cadet. The student has received \u201cadministrative punishment\u201d and is no longer in the preparatory school. Gen. Jay Silveria and the Academy emphasized that they stand by the message of the speech, that all should be treated with dignity and respect and that racism has no place in the institution.) \u201cIf you\u2019re outraged,\u201d\u00a0he said,\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re in the right place.\u201d He was just getting started.\u00a0\u201cYou should be outraged not only as an airman, but as a human being.\u201d With the five-minute video of his powerful lesson going viral, you can almost hear much of America answering,\u00a0\u201cAmen!\u201d If the general\u2019s resonant words had sounded in the same hall a couple of years ago, they would not have spread across the country; they would not have seemed remarkable. After all, speaking out against hatred has been a staple of America\u2019s most respected leaders for decades. But that has changed. It started to change the day Donald Trump launched his presidential election campaign. His willingness to traffic in bigotry has threatened to unravel America\u2019s social fabric and undermine the country\u2019s standing in the world from the day he became President. Silveria would not attack his commander in chief, but he knows that when five black students found the words\u00a0\u201cGo home\u201d\u00a0with a racial epithet on the message boards outside their rooms, it was not an isolated incident. We would be\u00a0\u201ctone deaf,\u201d\u00a0he said,\u00a0\u201cnot to think about the backdrop of what\u2019s going on in our country.\u201d\u00a0He mentioned the events in Charlottesville and Ferguson, and the controversy over protests at NFL games. Silveria gave the clearest explanation of how free speech is supposed to work.\u00a0\u201cThe appropriate response for horrible language and horrible ideas\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the appropriate response is a better idea.\u201d In the battlefield of ideas, the general launched a frontal assault.\u00a0\u201cWe are here,\u201d\u00a0he said,\u00a0\u201cbecause we have a better idea.\u201d\u00a0He called for\u00a0\u201ccivil discourse\u201d\u00a0on the issues tearing the country apart. And he explained why the ideas of the bigots are wrong, speaking about how diversity creates strength, about the power we derive because,\u00a0\u201cwe come from all walks of life\u2026 from all races \u2026 all backgrounds \u2026 all upbringings.\u201d The general extolled the academy\u2019s values. He might have been talking about American values, about human values, about the principles that America proudly championed until recently, exhorting his rapt audience to defend them\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and to leave if they cannot embrace them. At the heart of those intangible principles of tolerance and respect for others lies the most important element of humanity\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the imperative to treat every human being with respect. \u201cIf you can\u2019t treat some with dignity and respect, then you need to get out,\u201d\u00a0Silveria declared.\u00a0\u201cIf you can\u2019t treat someone of another gender \u2026 of another race or a different color skin with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.\u201d His words are all the more striking because he could have been addressing the current president. According to an Axios report, Trump has been mocking Sen. John McCain in private gatherings by imitating his distinctive movements, which are the result of injuries endured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Trump had already disparaged McCain\u00a0during the campaign for being captured during the war. The new revelations are all the more distasteful because McCain, who has served his country at great personal cost, is now suffering from a deadly form of brain cancer. We saw Trump\u2019s ghastly mockery of a disabled reporter during the campaign, and we heard him confess how he treats women. Children committing hate crimes reflect our society But it all pales next to his defense of white supremacists after the events in Charlottesville. And the contrast with Lt Gen. Silveria\u2019s words could not be sharper. As the general reminds us all that\u00a0\u201cwe are not na\u00efve,\u201d\u00a0we know prejudice exists, he also tells us it is our duty to fight against it. Instead of seizing what could have become a turning point in his presidency, instead of elevating the discourse, Trump jumped in the mud, defending men who advocate white supremacy, who marched chanting slogans directly translated\u00a0from the original German of the Nazis, and crying\u00a0out,\u00a0\u201cThe Jews will not replace us.\u201d\u00a0Trump said there were\u00a0\u201cvery fine people\u201d\u00a0in the bunch. The Canadian politician who could teach Americans a lesson in love The general issued a helpful reminder for those who don\u2019t want to see those views take hold in the age of Trump:\u00a0\u201cNo one can take away our values.\u201d\u00a0He was talking to his audience at the academy, at the air base, but his message applies to the entire country, and to people everywhere. When you hear an ugly, offensive idea, find a way to talk about it. Don\u2019t let it stand unchallenged. Seek a forum for civil discussion. Above all, offer a better idea.  Military rules, unlike the laws governing the rest of the country, do not allow\u00a0for racial slurs. For that reason, those who anonymously wrote the insults may end up getting expelled from the academy. To those who remain, Gen. Silveria paused dramatically with a suggestion:\u00a0\u201cGrab your phones,\u201d\u00a0he told them.\u00a0\u201cI want you to videotape this so that you have it, so that you can use it.\u201d\u00a0He urged everyone to use his words, share them and talk about them. \u201cSo that we all have the moral courage together.\u201d If only we had a President who could say that.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Former US Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is a political novelist and CNN contributor. His next book, \u201cBig Guns,\u201d will be released in April. This piece is one in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author. Steve Israel: Virginia has long been a reliable gauge of the political wave of the nation in the year after a presidential election The impact of Tuesday's Democratic victory goes far beyond 2018, as it opens the door to leveling the redistricting playing field Dispirited Democrats received an early Christmas gift Tuesday with the election of Ralph Northam as governor of Virginia. In an American political ritual, the same Democrats who were prepared to treat a loss as irrelevant are now portraying their win as earth-shattering. Meanwhile, Republicans who couldn\u2019t wait to frame their victory as a sweeping affirmation of the entire Trump agenda now treat the defeat of Ed Gillespie, a former RNC chair, as a political asterisk. But Virginia state elections offer a real historical precedent. In volatile political environments like the one we\u2019re now in, Virginia has curiously become a reliable barometer of a national political wave in the year following a presidential election. It\u2019s not that Virginia is a bellwether, it\u2019s that it\u2019s Cassandra on the Potomac. It forecasts future elections, but its warnings are usually unnoticed. Take heed, fellow pundits and prognosticators: In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States. In 1993, Republican George Allen became governor of Virginia. In 1994, Newt Gingrich led House Republicans to win 54 seats and take the House majority for the first time in decades. In 2004, George W. Bush was re-elected President of the United States. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine was elected Virginia Governor. In 2006, House Democrats picked up 31 seats to capture the House majority. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States. In 2009, Republican Bob McDonnell became Governor in Richmond. In 2010, House Republicans won 63 seats and recaptured their majority. Republicans know Tuesday's elections had a message. They just don't know what it was. Virginia\u2019s prescience doesn\u2019t hold every year. But it\u2019s been the frothing tip of every wave election in the past 25 years. And right now, I suspect there are plenty of House Republicans looking for the high ground of retirement. Virginia\u2019s Tuesday election has implications far beyond 2018. Every 10 years, states engage in congressional redistricting. (Full disclosure: I\u2019m a strategic adviser to the Democratic Governors Association, which is working to advocate for the election of governors, who have a key voice in that process). Depending on the state, the party that controls the government draws the squiggly congressional maps designed to elect House members of the same party for the ensuing decade. Republicans did a brilliant job of defeating almost 1,000 Democratic governors, state legislators and other local officials after 2008. They took control of redistricting and built a firewall against House Democratic gains. That process \u2013 used by both parties \u2013 is why Congress is so polarized today. Redistricting is a perverse take on that old song, \u201cHokey Pokey:\u201d you put your right foot in, you take your left foot out.  That was certainly true in Virginia in 2011 \u2013 where Virginia\u2019s Republican governor signed congressional and legislative maps that have since been struck down as illegal racial gerrymanders by the courts. Under those 2011 gerrymandered maps, Democrats in Virginia held just 3 out of 11 Congressional seats in 2016. After the US Supreme Court invalidated Virginia\u2019s congressional map, Governor McAuliffe refused to sign redrawn lines that were not fair, resulting in the intervention of the courts and a new map that netted Democrats one seat. The Democratic victory in Virginia sets the stage for leveling the redistricting playing field that\u2019s so advantaged Republicans. The legendary Former Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill famously said, \u201cAll politics is local.\u201d In the case of Virginia, local politics is national.",

She is also a freelance writer and former political reporter and analyst in North Carolina. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Kerra Bolton: The Trump presidency has exposed our nation's festering racial wounds and changed me as a black woman I'm still hopeful, because the character of the country is more than the man who occupies the Oval Office, she writes Perhaps more than any other President in US history, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency so far has been dominated by open expressions of racial division. President Donald Trump has exposed the nation\u2019s open, festering, racial wounds \u2013 whether by defending white supremacists and nationalists as \u201cvery fine people\u201d after Charlottesville or denouncing NFL players who kneel during the playing of the National Anthem as \u201csons of bitches.\u201d We used to laugh at characters like Archie Bunker. Now we have one with an active Twitter account and access to nuclear launch codes. The danger of Donald Trump and his administration is not just his saber rattling or even the systematic erosion of President Barack Obama\u2019s policies. It is also the intentional denial of historic facts, the appropriation of national symbols for political aims, and the consistent discrediting of black women who oppose him. Even as an African-American woman who chose to live abroad months before last year\u2019s election, I have been profoundly affected by his presidency. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve taken away from a year of the Trump administration. I am perpetually gaslit. Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly, the one who moderates said would bring sanity to the White House, mythologized Robert E. Lee as an \u201chonorable man who gave up his country to fight for his state.\u201d Gaslighting isn\u2019t just practiced by white members of Trump\u2019s administration. Ben Carson, a black man and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said slaves were immigrants. On the bright side, Frederick Douglass \u2013 who died in 1895 \u2013 is \u201cdoing an amazing job\u201d and \u201cgetting recognized more and more,\u201d we learned from the President. Under such factual and logical assaults, one begins to feel like  unwilling participant in a disappearing act. The most shocking moments since Trump was elected Symbols matter. I lived in North Carolina for nearly 20 years, so I\u2019m accustomed to white, southern gentlemen of a certain age (sometimes in seersucker suits) correcting anyone who would listen to assert that that the Civil War was actually \u201cthe War of Northern Aggression.\u201d But it\u2019s less quirky when white men are brandishing Tiki torches and threatening violence to preserve statues of men who kidnapped, raped, and enslaved my ancestors. If the losers get to rewrite history, who determines the future? I have revisited my definition of patriotism. Reductive arguments that \u201ctaking a knee\u201d during the National Anthem disrespects the military and the flag assume a \u201cwhites only\u201d experience of America. I imagine that it\u2019s hard for Donald Trump and some of his supporters on this argument to imagine the reality of a man like my father, who enlisted in the US Marines during the Vietnam War. He was the only son of parents born in South Carolina, who were only a generation or two from slavery. His example shows that sometimes patriotism means fighting to preserve democratic ideals abroad, even if you don\u2019t get to fully experience them at home. For many of us, however, patriotism can also mean loving a country so much, you insist it can do better. I have buried respectability politics for good. For decades, I believed that if I spoke, dressed, and behaved in ways that didn\u2019t scare white people, I would avoid their anger or judgment. A white congressman can yell \u201cyou lie\u201d during a State of the Union speech made by the nation\u2019s first black President, but a grieving military widow who says the President couldn\u2019t even remember her slain husband\u2019s name during a condolence call is discredited and dismissed. There are some things worth being an angry black woman about. I now embrace that label. In Virginia, a rejection of the Trump playbook I remain stubbornly hopeful. Decisive Democratic victories in Virginia, New Jersey, and other parts of the country came as a clapback to the politics and personality of President Trump. Virginia Democrats swept races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and the state legislature. Danica Roem, the state\u2019s first openly transgender candidate, defeated Bob Marshall, a longtime Republican incumbent who was the architect of Virginia\u2019s bathroom bill. A civil rights lawyer who defended Black Lives Matter demonstrators in court is now Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney. Closer to home, in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s election, I co-founded a race conversations project with A.J. Hartley, a white, male novelist and Shakespeare professor. In a multimedia project, we attempted to model how to have respectful conversations about race, including staying at the table when feeling attacked or hurt.  These heartbreaking conversations that also resulted in an enduring friendship, coupled with the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s elections, changed me \u2013 because it no longer matters to me who is in the White House. The character of the country is more than the man who occupies the Oval Office. It\u2019s all of us, together, we the people.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Dr. Azeem Ibrahim is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy and author of \u201cThe Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar\u2019s Hidden Genocide\u201d (Hurst & Oxford University Press) More than 600,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh The exodus has been building for years and should be recognized as genocide, Ibrahim says The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar is now widely described as ethnic cleansing. But the situation has been evolving. And now, it seems, we can no longer avoid the conclusion we have all been dreading. This is a genocide. And we, in the international community, must recognize it as such. Article II of United Nation\u2019s 1948 Genocide Convention describes genocide as \u201cany of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\u201d Though the Rohingya situation has met most of the above criteria for being described as a genocide under international law for a number of years now, the label has been resisted until now because we think of genocide as one huge act of frenzied violence, like the machete insanity in Rwanda or the gas chambers of Nazi Germany. But the final peak of violence is in all historical cases merely the visible tip of the iceberg. And the final outburst only occurs once it has already been rendered unavoidable by the political context. In Rwanda, Hutu tribal propaganda ran for years on the radio and in magazines referring to the Tutsis as cockroaches and a mortal threat to the Hutus that needed to be eliminated lest the Hutus themselves would die. Kill or be killed. The frenzied killing was not something that just occurred to the Hutus one day in April 1994. It was the logical conclusion of a campaign of dehumanization and paranoia which lasted for years. The same is true of the Holocaust. The Nazi genocide began slowly and had few distinctive outbursts of violence to delineate where one degree of crime against humanity ended and where another began. All in all, that genocide developed and unfolded over a period of more than 10 years. Most of that period was not taken up with the killing of Jews, Gypsies and all the other \u201csub-humans.\u201d Rather, it was taken up with manufacturing of the category of \u201csub-humans\u201d by state propaganda. Only once the problem was manufactured and sold to the wider population did the \u201cfinal solution\u201d become viable. In Myanmar, extremist Buddhist monks have been preaching that the Rohingya are reincarnated from snakes and insects. Killing them would not be a crime against humanity, they say \u2013 it would be more like pest control. And necessary \u201cpest control\u201d too. Just like the Tutsi conspiracy to kill all the Hutus, or the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Rohingya are supposed to be agents of a global Islamist conspiracy to take over the world and forcibly instate a global caliphate. The duty of any good Buddhist who wants to maintain the national and religious character of Myanmar is to prevent the Islamist takeover, and thus to help remove the threat posed by the \u201cvermin.\u201d Photos: A new life for the Rohingya Every modern genocide has followed this pattern. Years of concerted dehumanization campaigns are the absolutely necessary pre-condition for the mass murder at the end. Usually these campaigns are led by a repressive government, but other political forces also come into play. Such was the case in Bosnia, Darfur and Rwanda. And so it is with Myanmar. The campaign of dehumanization against the Rohingya has been going on for decades, and events certainly took an unmistakeable turn towards genocide since at least the outbursts of communal violence in 2012. Those clashes, and the ones in the subsequent years, drove 200,000 to 300,000 Rohingya out of Myanmar. But somehow, at that rate of attrition, and against the backdrop of Myanmar\u2019s supposed move towards democracy with the election of Aung San Suu Kyi to power in late 2015, world leaders have allowed themselves to hope that the situation could still be turned around. Now, the reality of an exodus of a further 600,000 people in the space of just six weeks; the incontrovertible evidence of large scale burning of villages by the Myanmar military \u2013 which the military is calling clearance operations of terrorists \u2013 and the reports of widespread extra-judicial killings against fleeing civilians by the country\u2019s federal security forces have made it much more difficult to avoid the conclusion: this is genocide. We no longer have just the slow-burning genocidal environment which whittles down a people until their ultimate extinction. Now we are also confronting the loud bang at the end. More than half of an entire population has been removed from their ancestral lands in just eight weeks! The tragedy is that the international community will abet the situation. The UN Security Council will decline to respond to the situation with the seriousness it deserves. If a situation is defined by the Council as a \u201cgenocide,\u201d then the UN becomes legally bound to intervene, with peace-keeping missions and so on. That is why Western countries will be reluctant initiate such a move, and China, who is building one branch of its New Silk Road infrastructure right through Rakhine State to access the port of Sittwe, will likely veto any such proposal. Just like we did in Rwanda, just like we did in the Balkans, we are once again seeing a genocide happen before our very eyes. And we will do nothing about it. We will bury our heads in the sand, and when our children will ask us why we let this happen we will plead ignorance. Once the final act of killing starts, it is usually too late. For the Rohingya, the final act is in full swing. And still we are in denial about what is happening.",

In case you\u2019ve forgotten \u2013 because he counts on us having a short attention span \u2013 during the 2016 election, Donald Trump was accused of sexual assault or harassment by 17 women and Trump was literally caught on tape bragging about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d  Nonetheless, he was elected president, including winning the vote of 52% of white women. Weinstein 'witch hunt'? Wrong, Woody Allen The day after Trump won, basically the other 48% of white women, most of the women of color in America, and a lot of men were pretty much horrified.  This was definitely true in Hollywood. America\u2019s cultural tastemakers had mustered massive amounts of money and outrage to try to bring about Trump\u2019s defeat.  And they \u2013 liberal celebrities specifically \u2013 failed. These stars and titans who outwardly champion women\u2019s rights and equality had not only failed to leverage their prodigious influence and power to elect the nation\u2019s first female president but, instead, saw the ascension of a President who in every way seemed to be a backlash against the fairness and tolerance for which Hollywood has always imagined itself to stand. RNC chair: Weinstein and Trump don't compare As Rebecca Traister wrote in New York Magazine after the Weinstein allegations started coming out, \u201cSomething has changed.\u201d  She suggests a link between not only Trump and Weinstein but also Bill Cosby, Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly. Traister ponders whether there have been \u201cshifts in how we understand these kinds of abuses\u201d perhaps combined with \u201cscores of women, finding strength and some kind of power in numbers.\u201d All of which I hope is true. Beginning with the largest march of women and their allies the day after Trump was inaugurated, we reached some critical mass in America and around the world of just refusing to stay silent and, together, more and more women are speaking out.  And at the same time, for Hollywood in particular, the challenge of Weinstein was interesting timing. Coming on the heels of all the outrage about Trump in particular, Hollywood couldn\u2019t really afford to stay silent without looking ridiculously and obviously hypocritical. This wasn\u2019t Woody Allen or Roman Polanski or even Casey Affleck. Weinstein was a titan of Hollywood, almost like its own unelected president \u2013 and the head of the \u201clook I\u2019m a liberal feminist\u201d charitable parade \u2013 alleged to be doing the same thing Hollywood stars had just been shouting against Trump for. Even in the face of the sheer scale and severity of what he is accused of doing, the swift downfall of Weinstein at pretty much every level has been breathtaking in its own way.  It\u2019s almost as if Hollywood, frustrated they couldn\u2019t impeach Donald Trump, impeached Harvey Weinstein instead.  Both deserve it. What Mayim Bialik reveals about #MeToo There is some illusion here. Hollywood, of course, is the land of illusion and one of the most pronounced and prolonged of these is the discrepancy between what the audience is meant to see and what goes on behind the scenes. You would think that the town that literally invented \u201cscripted reality shows\u201d \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a thing \u2014 would learn to not believe its own projections. Hollywood has always talked a good game about women\u2019s rights, gay rights, racial justice, and economic justice but then failed time and time again to live up to its own rhetoric. Hollywood is supposedly so gay friendly, but where are all those openly gay and trans leading characters in mainstream movies? Hollywood supposedly supports racial inclusion, but the characters remain as white as the writers\u2019 rooms and the exceptions are still too rare to be anywhere near the norm. And Hollywood supposedly supports women\u2019s and gender equity but plainly not only exploits but exacerbates the hyper-sexualization and objectification of women. And if Hollywood is so supposedly hyper-liberal, why are \u201cbad guys\u201d in action movies so often based on anti-Muslim stereotypes and why do the \u201cgood guys\u201d suggest that torturing suspects works? Do all these liberal Hollywood people leave their politics at home?  Make no mistake about it, Harvey Weinstein is at fault for his behaviors and the climate he created in his companies and in his industry.  And at the same time Hollywood is responsible for its longstanding hypocrisy and double standard on issues of equity and justice. Just like Donald Trump is responsible, in some way, for having gotten us all to surface and scrutinize these issues in new ways.  And hopefully that means Hollywood \u2013 and all of us \u2013 will change for the better.",

Follow him @deanofcomedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Dean Obeidallah: Trump's latest NFL comments show he doesn't understand the meaning of key American freedoms In place of embracing freedom of speech, he is trying to undermine and threaten it, writes Obeidallah Donald Trump may be the American President, but he doesn\u2019t understand the importance of American values \u2013 particularly freedom of expression, pluralism and tolerance. In fact, he is a threat to them. We saw yet another example of this on Friday, when Trump denounced NFL player Colin Kaepernick and others like him who have taken a knee during the national anthem to protest what they view as racial injustices in our nation. Trump declared at a campaign rally in Huntsville, Alabama, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired!\u201d What Trump doesn\u2019t get is that Kaepernick wasn\u2019t taking a knee because he was trying to disrespect our nation. It\u2019s because Kaepernick and others like him love this country and want it to live up to the ideals it was founded upon. What Trump's NFL, Curry remarks should signal to his base In fact, after Kaepernick began taking a knee last year, he explained that he was doing it to bring attention to the oppression of \u201cblack people and people of color\u201d and cited the unjust killing of people of color by the police. But he added that he would stand for the national anthem once \u201cthere\u2019s significant change, and I feel that flag represents what it\u2019s supposed to represent.\u201d This is the very same idea that President Barack Obama championed in his 2008 election night speech. \u201cFor that is the true genius of America \u2013 that America can change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.\u201d And it\u2019s the same sentiment that has inspired so many in our nation to speak out and to engage in civil disobedience over the course of American history. But Trump doesn\u2019t get that. Trump views dissent as a threat \u2013 not as a form of patriotism. Just look at his tweet Saturday morning urging NFL owners to \u201cfire or suspend\u201d players who refuse to stand for the national anthem. And in response to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calling Trump\u2019s words \u201cdivisive,\u201d Trump again made clear his contempt for freedom of expression. \u201cTell them (players) to stand!\u201d he said. How NFL teams responded to Trump during anthem Trump is demanding conformity and obedience over championing freedom of expression. That is the type of sentiment you expect to hear from a Third World dictator \u2013 not the President of the United States of America. In a tweet Saturday morning, he revoked his invitation to the NBA champion Golden State Warriors to visit the White House. Some believe that Trump is engaging in this fight as a ploy to distract the media and the public from the likely failure of the Graham-Cassidy health care bill and the possible loss of the Trump-supported Republican candidate in the Alabama Republican senate runoff. Maybe. But Trump\u2019s rejection of American values was on display long before this weekend. As a candidate, Trump led a war on the American values of tolerance and pluralism. He demonized Mexican immigrants and stunningly called for a ban on Muslims from American soil. And as President, he rescinded DACA and pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a man who had been repeatedly accused of profiling Latinos. Beyond that, Trump refused to denounce white supremacists \u2013 both as a candidate in regards to David Duke\u2019s endorsement and as President in response to Charlottesville \u2013 until he was called out by the media, the public and even some of his fellow Republicans. If he truly believed in the words enshrined in our Declaration of Independence \u2013 that \u201call men are created equal\u201d \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t need to be shamed into verbally denouncing white supremacy.  And Trump\u2019s attacks on freedom of expression aren\u2019t new. Only one month before the 2016 election, Trump stunningly called for Saturday Night Live to be canceled because the show mocked him in a way he felt was unfair. And just last week we saw Trump demand ESPN apologize to him because one of the networks\u2019 anchors had tweeted that Trump was a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d Imagine if President Obama had called for a conservative to publicly apologize for his or her criticism of Obama?! Many would agree that Trump doesn\u2019t get what it means to be President \u2013 his low approval ratings support this idea. But I say Trump doesn\u2019t get American values, and I doubt he ever will.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. In forthcoming book, Clinton criticizes Sanders for running as a Democrat while not being one. She's right, says Jill Filipovic Filipovic: If the left is going to win it needs to stop factionalizing the party and buying into the GOP line demonizing liberals There are few things more unpleasant than relitigating the 2016 Democratic primary. But more than a year later, it hasn\u2019t stopped, partly because the race touched on so many hot spots that continue to animate our politics: the way gender shapes how we perceive power, how class struggle collides with racial entitlement, what it even means to be \u201cprogressive\u201d or to work outside  the system. And now, there\u2019s something new to argue over: Hillary Clinton\u2019s forthcoming book, \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d In it, according to excerpts posted by a group of Clinton supporters, she criticizes her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, for running to be the Democratic nominee while not actually being a Democrat, and for targeting her in a campaign of character assassination, instead of doing a deep dive into policy. Predictably, the response from the Sanders left and the Trump right has been about the same: Shut up and go away. This is after the demands that she \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and \u201capologize.\u201d (Has any politician in the history of America been ordered to say she\u2019s sorry as often as Hillary Clinton?) Is the relitigation of the primary pleasant? No. Is a look at what happened, from the perspective of the only woman in American history to be a hair\u2019s width away from the presidency, a pretty valuable contribution? Yes. And while this will certainly take a few minutes away from a news cycle of North Korean nukes, horrific natural disasters and a growing list of Trump cruelties and blunders, there isn\u2019t really a better time: In a few months we\u2019ll be gearing up for the midterm elections, and after that, our insane election cycles will have us in presidential-campaigning mode. It seems likely that Sanders will again be one of the campaigners. Clinton: I was thinking 'back up, you creep' And so it\u2019s only fair to take a look at his previous efforts, and learn some lessons. Clinton is right: Sanders\u2019 attacks on her character fed the same narrative as Trump\u2019s. They hurt her in the general election. And she\u2019s right that running on the Democratic ticket when you\u2019re not a Democrat isn\u2019t just hypocritical, it can be incredibly damaging. For one thing, it gives a candidate a platform to trash the very party he says he wants to lead. On the left today, the Sanders/Clinton divide remains.  In some progressive circles, being a \u201cneoliberal\u201d is, as others have astutely observed, \u201cthe left\u2019s favorite insult,\u201d a handy catchall for everything that\u2019s wrong with the world. In their framework, Hillary Clinton is the epitome of neoliberalism, which is why she lost; Bernie Sanders is the bulwark against it, which is why he lost (funny how that works). \u201cNeoliberal\u201d unfortunately remains ill-defined \u2013 in theory it means a social liberal who favors global capitalism and corporate-friendly policies at the expense of social welfare; in practice, it seems to mean anything from \u201ca member of the Democratic Party\u201d to \u201canyone who voted for Clinton\u201d to \u201csomeone I am simply deeming less progressive than me\u201d to \u201ca description of actual right-wing Republican-crafted policies that are somehow getting blamed on Democrats.\u201d Madden: Clinton book 'sucks up oxygen' for Dem party This is because among some factions of the left \u2013 Sanders loyalists, newly minted socialists \u2013 being a liberal is just as bad as being an anti-gay pro-gun anti-choice tax-slashing administrative-state-dismantling deep-red congressman who moonlights as a Breitbart columnist. Is that Sanders\u2019 fault? No. (And indeed, the ascendance of his brand of socialism in the United States is long overdue.) But his attacks on the Democratic Party helped set the stage for this thoroughly dysfunctional, and ultimately destructive discourse. On the right, things are different. What\u2019s clear from the seeming millions of post-election dispatches from \u201cReal America\u201d (that is, working class white America; black and brown America somehow rarely makes the authenticity cut) is that a whole lot of conservative voters cast their ballots for Trump not because they share his values exactly, or because they were voting for anything, but because they hate liberals and wanted to give us the finger. A sophisticated right-wing propaganda machine has helped to sow this malevolence, and the GOP has reaped the benefits. Too much of the left has joined right in on the liberal-bashing. What too many on the left don\u2019t realize, though, is that the rest of the country \u2014 the nonleft \u2013 doesn\u2019t make the distinction between liberals, progressives, socialists and so on. We\u2019re all just liberal elite scum. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re all losing \u2013 from the far-left Bernie wing (whose policies I\u2019m more inclined to support) to centrists (of whom Clinton, who ran the most progressive campaign in American history, was not exactly one). Sanders: Ending DACA most cruel, ugly decision The 2016 primary pushed the Democratic Party further to the left than any time in its history. For that, Sanders deserves a lot of credit. But the Democrats lost, and, as Clinton points out, Sanders also deserves some \u201ccredit\u201d for that. The reasons behind Clinton\u2019s loss are many, and Sanders was hardly the No. 1 cause. But he was no neutral force. The fact is, if those of us who want to move our country to the left are going to win \u2013 not just elections, but on a policy level and a cultural one, too \u2013 we need to stop buying the right-wing lines about liberals and Democrats, and stop demonizing our closest allies and best chances of retaking any power at all. Sanders has positioned himself as a leader for the future of the left, and his followers agree, with near-messianic worship. Embracing the whole left would be a good place for him to start.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua A. Douglas is a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law.  He is the co-editor of \u201cElection Law Stories.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed are his own. Joshua Douglas: Federal courts have stepped in to put an end to Texas' discriminatory voting laws and regulations The rulings could serve as lessons for other states considering new election laws, he says It has become a disturbing pattern: Texas has systematically engaged in voter discrimination and suppression. In the past few weeks, in a series of separate rulings, federal courts have found that the state intentionally discriminated against minority voters by enacting a strict voter ID law, unfair redistricting plans, and unlawful rules on language assistance at the polls. It\u2019s important that the Supreme Court affirm these rulings. Voter discrimination, for any reason, should never occur, yet Texas\u2019 experience should serve as a wake-up call to other states considering new election laws. It should also prompt courts and policymakers to stand up for minority rights. Indeed, the federal courts have painted a poor picture of Texas\u2019 actions on voting rights: The Republican-controlled Legislature has systematically discriminated against minority voters in an effort to retain its majority status in the state. This pattern may well cause federal judges to place Texas back under federal supervision under the Voting Rights Act, which would require the state to seek preapproval from the federal government or the courts before enacting new voting laws. After the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, gutting a major provision of the Voting Rights Act, this option is available only if a court finds intentional discrimination \u2013 which, say the courts, has now occurred in Texas several times. To review: First, late last month a federal district judge held that Texas purposefully discriminated against minority voters through its strict voter ID law, knowing that minorities would have a harder time complying with the requirement. The court found that various aspects of the law \u2013 such as the type of ID it required, obstacles to obtaining an acceptable ID, and inadequate education on the measure \u2013 were intended to discriminate against African-American and Hispanic voters. New Texas voter ID law discriminates, federal judge rules The case bounced around the federal court system, with judges consistently ruling against Texas\u2019 law. Texas has now brazenly asked the court of appeals to allow it to keep using the law, barely acknowledging that several federal judges have found it discriminatory. The battle is likely to reach the Supreme Court in the coming years. Second, a three-judge federal district court panel issued a series of rulings holding that Texas\u2019 redistricting plans were unlawful racial gerrymanders. The latest decision, handed down just after the voter ID ruling, held that the state\u2019s 2013 redrawing of the map for its state House districts intentionally discriminated against minority voters in four of those districts. The court required Texas to redraw them ahead of the 2018 election. Just a week earlier, the same three-judge district court panel invalidated two of Texas\u2019 congressional districts for the same reason, finding intentional discrimination. The court was set to hold a hearing the following week on a remedy to this gerrymander, with the potential that the judges would draw a new map for the 2018 election, but Justice Samuel Alito put the lower court\u2019s decision on hold as the full Supreme Court considers the appeal. Third, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a Texas law requiring voters in need of language assistance to receive it only from a registered voter from the same county. The court found that this limitation violated the Voting Rights Act, which allows individuals to choose whomever they want to help, so long as that person is not their employer or union leader. This ruling will have a tangible impact on many Latino voters in the state, making it easier for them to receive the language assistance they need.  One  or more of these cases is sure to reach the Supreme Court. The justices will then have an opportunity to rule against these discriminatory actions and send a clear message that politicians should not be able to rig election results by manipulating who may vote and how representation occurs. If Texas is allowed to continue its shenanigans, however, then all bets are off on any meaningful limits to partisan manipulation in the future. Texas\u2019 experience should also sound a caution bell to other states, like North Carolina, that are considering new election rules. North Carolina is engaged in a divisive redistricting debate and the courts have previously invalidated its voter ID law, citing its discriminatory purpose and effect. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found last year that the state\u2019s new election laws targeted \u201cAfrican-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Given this history, North Carolina legislators, and lawmakers from other states, should pause before they enact new rules with a partisan and discriminatory purpose that hamper the fundamental right to vote. Finally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 Department of Justice must rethink its position on voting rights. Under President Barack Obama, the DOJ had joined the plaintiffs against Texas\u2019 voter ID law; the new administration reversed course and told the court that it no longer believes Texas\u2019 law had a discriminatory purpose. But this should not be a partisan issue: Discrimination is discrimination, regardless of which political party is in the White House. If the Trump administration truly wants to demonstrate a commitment to democracy and racial equality, it should recognize the clear implication of these judicial rulings and support plaintiffs who challenge discriminatory voting laws. In the end, we can celebrate the independent federal judiciary serving as a stopgap to the worst abuses in the voting process. Voting discrimination may be bigger in Texas, but as the past few weeks have shown, so is Texas federal judges\u2019 ability to stop it.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joseph Sakran is a trauma surgeon and director of emergency general surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Follow him @JosephSakran. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Joseph Sakran: As a gunshot victim and a surgeon who witnesses the effects of gun violence, I am on a mission I strongly believe this conversation has to be centered on our nation's health -- not race, not politics, not money, he writes A high school football game: a scene common in many of our memories. But for one young man, in his senior year, it was different. After watching a football game from the stands on a Friday night, a fight broke out as he was standing nearby.   The sounds of gunfire punctured the night, and an errant bullet punctured his throat.  As he lay on the ground with his blood pooling beneath him, veering toward losing consciousness, he could vaguely hear people shouting and sirens blaring. I am a trauma surgeon at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, a city struggling with more than 200 homicides this year so far \u2013 on pace for the most annual murders in the city.  But this is not a story about one of my patients.  I was that 17-year-old with a hole in my throat and the fear of death in my mind. And it isn\u2019t just Baltimore\u2019s problem: over 30,000 people die from firearms annually.  What are we going to do about it? Every time I have to walk to the waiting room and speak with a family of a gunshot victim, I think of my own family and what must have been going through their minds at that time.  By far the worst moment for me is when I see those faces of mothers and fathers anxiously waiting for an update on a loved one who has died.  I approach them knowing the news I\u2019m about to share with them will turn their world upside down.  Often, I leave numb, with the image of their faces chiseled into my memory. Today, I am on a mission to help others impacted by gun violence.  As a former patient, and a surgeon who continually witnesses firsthand the effects of gun violence on victims and their families, I have a great deal of experience to draw from. Earlier this month, I attended a hearing about gun violence at the Baltimore City Council.  The hearing was controversial because many citizens felt the bill would not reduce gun violence and simply lend to unconstitutional policing.  The room was packed.  On the table was a proposal that would create one-year mandatory minimum jail sentence for anyone found to be in possession of an illegal gun,  throughout the majority of the city. Manhattan DA: This bill could turn your city into the Wild West Baltimore police commanders in white uniforms and suits, who have been working to curb the violence, sat on one side.  Members of the public, including many activists fighting for fairness in a city beleaguered by a history of racial injustice, sat all around.  A City Council realized the challenge that lay ahead that morning as they looked back at the scene of a divided room searching for answers. The proposal comes after an era of legislators across the country repealing mandatory minimum sentences that many say unfairly filled our prisons with African-American men, often facing drug charges.  At the same time, Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis believes that a major source of the epidemic of violence in the city is the light sentencing of people who\u2019ve been arrested previously for carrying illegal guns but have returned to Baltimore streets, and taken their illegal guns with them. I was there neither to support nor to oppose the bill, but as a doctor, to discuss gun violence for what it is: the public health crisis that communities all across my great city and this nation face. As the period for public testimony opened, City Councilman Eric Costello called me up to deliver my thoughts.  It wasn\u2019t my first foray into a political arena. During this last presidential election, I created \u201cDoctors for Hillary,\u201d a grass-roots organization of doctors and allied health professionals that backed the former secretary of state because she had made health issues \u2013 including gun violence \u2013 an integral part of her campaign platform. I was surprised when, as I approached the podium, an uproar rang out.  People were yelling. The podium right in front of me was overturned.  A crowd began shouting, \u201cNo Justice No Peace.\u201d I hadn\u2019t yet opened my mouth, and I was completely blindsided by how chaotic the situation quickly became.  I heard people yelling about \u201cthis white Hopkins surgeon,\u201d that he is \u201cnot one of our people.\u201d My heart sank. This reaction exemplifies what is wrong in our country today: We are not talking to each other.  We\u2019re allowing assumptions based simply on appearance to prevent real dialogue \u2013 the kind of dialogue that can solve problems. The kind of dialogue that, based on what I have seen as a trauma surgeon, I know can save lives. How could they know based on my skin color that I am the son of immigrant parents?  How could they know I bear the physical scars of bullets?  How can we know anything about each other if we don\u2019t give each other a chance?

Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic \"I Have A Dream\" speech at the March On Washington for Jobs and Freedom Fifty-four years later, King's legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo, Joseph writes Monday marks the 54th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s iconic \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech at the March on Washington. King\u2019s speech marked a new epoch in American history. King\u2019s most well-known speech mixed a radical critique of institutional racism and white supremacy with a defiant optimism for the future that resonates as much today \u2013 in the aftermath of Charlottesville and other racially motivated conflicts \u2013 as it did in his own time. Although not an official holiday, all Americans should embrace this anniversary as a day of service on behalf of social justice, what King characterized as a person\u2019s highest public calling. I plan to devote my time and energies that day working and dialoguing with students, community leaders and activists committed to fulfilling the promise of an event whose full title \u2013 \u201cThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\u201d \u2013 remains the most important and unfulfilled challenge of the civil rights era. The focus on King\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d buried some of the most important aspects of the speech. At the March on Washington, King successfully linked a black-led civil rights movement to the sacred texts that form the beating heart of American democracy. Afterward, no one could successfully accuse black protesters of being unAmerican or anti-patriotic, even though many would continue to try. In less than two years, President Lyndon B. Johnson would echo King\u2019s words in the aftermath of \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in Selma, comparing peaceful protesters brutalized by Alabama law enforcement with the heroes of the American Revolution. In so doing, like America\u2019s founders, King introduced ideas about freedom bigger than one man, movement or nation, ones that have resonated around the world from the Arab Spring to movements for democracy in China, Africa, Latin America and Europe. Speaking in 1963 against the backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument on the centennial anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, King characterized the words embedded in America\u2019s Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as a \u201cpromissory note\u201d that, for blacks, remained unfulfilled behind a veil of racial injustice, legal apartheid and endemic poverty. Although we remain far more comfortable with the image of King as a racial healer, in Washington that sunny afternoon, he spoke with bracing candor that is well worth remembering. Blacks had received \u201ca bad check,\u201d King observed, explaining the gathering of a quarter million in the nation\u2019s capital as an effort to claim, \u201cthe riches of freedom and the security of justice.\u201d King extolled the virtues of grassroots organizing, praising the \u201cmarvelous new militancy\u201d erupting in all quarters of the nation even as he warned against the temptation to use physical violence. He challenged the activists of his era and our own to \u201crise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\u201d This speech made Martin Luther King Jr. revolutionary Yet King remained sober about the breadth and depth of institutional racism. He refused to sugarcoat or gloss over the massive obstacles that remained in the quest for a \u201cbeloved community\u201d free of injustice. Black Americans and their allies had a moral, as well as political, obligation to resist police brutality, oppose racial segregation, and risk being confined to \u201cnarrow jail cells\u201d in order to bear public witness to brutality and oppression that diminished the nation\u2019s democratic promise and potential, King argued. Then came the dream. A dream that King described as \u201cdeeply rooted in the American dream\u201d that would allow the nation to match its soaring democratic rhetoric with new political realities capable of extending citizenship to all Americans.  He specifically cited the states of Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama \u2013 the sites of bloody battles during the Civil War and during the civil rights era \u2013 as exemplars of the need to build racial reconciliation on the bedrock foundation of historical truth. King\u2019s vision of a multicultural America demanded truth and reconciliation, one that acknowledged slavery\u2019s contemporary reverberations, criticized elected officials for inflaming already heated racial passions, and identified children of all colors and backgrounds as the hope for a future free of hate. We remain painfully distant from the kind of racial healing King proposed that day, despite important civil rights victories highlighted by Barack Obama\u2019s presidential election. The hard work of reconciliation comes through a sober examination of discomfiting historical truths about slavery, Jim Crow, and their contemporary manifestations in devaluing black lives in America. National recognition of racial inequality\u2019s continuing legacy requires the transformation of institutions forged against the backdrop of racial injustice. The \u201cmountain of despair\u201d that King spoke of 54 years ago remains an ever-present aspect of American society, as events in Charlottesville and elsewhere remind us of. Combatting racial despair in our own time requires the courage to admit to moral and political failures of will and imagination and to create a political framework that will heal past and continuing ruptures.  Yet King\u2019s understanding of the tragic dimensions of the nation\u2019s racial history never undermined his faith in one day achieving racial justice. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech is as relevant today as it was over a half century ago precisely because its unsentimental vision of American society demands a mature, reflective and bold approach to social justice organizing. Fifty-four years later, King\u2019s legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King\u2019s words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice. He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Michael D'Antonio: America faces two Trumps: \"Scripted Trump\" (with teleprompter) and \"Reckless Trump\" (without) He says previous presidents have displayed strong personalities while remaining stable leaders. Trump fails to do this Bill Clinton could be both Bubba on the front porch and the pastor who bound the nation\u2019s wounds after the Oklahoma City bombing.  George W. Bush was able to gently declare Islam a religion of peace after the 9/11 terror attacks and, on the eve of war with Iraq, say: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the force necessary to deal with the security situation.\u201d Barack Obama was comfortable rousing partisans with jabs at the GOP at a convention and singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d in Charleston, South Carolina. Think back to FDR and it\u2019s easy to recognize that modern presidents have often shown the world different sides depending on the moment, but always in the context of a steady personality. Then there is Donald Trump, who also has shown two sides, most dramatically in the past 10 days. After giving a measured statement last week condemning hatred and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, he struck a wildly different tone in an exchange with reporters the next day, drawing widespread condemnation by appearing to equate the far right protesters in that city with those rallying against bigotry. Trump taunts McCain over health care vote Then this Monday, he swung back to his earlier tone when, in a speech on his new Afghanistan policy, he condemned hatred and division. Finally, having apparently strained to act appropriately on Monday, Donald Trump returned from his bad boy timeout Tuesday to address a Phoenix crowd as the familiar, raging and erratic character who appears at his rallies. He once again bashed the mainstream press and senators in his own party. Then he distorted his record on the racial tragedy in Charlottesville, reminding the world that he lacks the moral core that has allowed previous presidents to display strong personalities while keeping faith with a nation that needs a stable leader. How is this playing across the country? Not well, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll Wednesday: 62% of respondents said President Trump is doing more to divide the country, and when it comes to the President\u2019s response to the violence in Charlottesville, 60% disapprove of his response to Charlottesville compared with 32% who approve. Jen Psaki: Trump can stay sane for approximately 24 hours The fact is, many presidents have been adept at showing different sides to different audiences, but all in the service of a sensible set of goals. Trump\u2019s wild tacking from one personality to the other is self-destructive. The campaign that put Trump in the White House was a manic circus held in a hall of mirrors, and his presidency has brought more of the same. Rather than moderating, he has swung between two poles. On rare occasions he looks and sounds almost presidential as he proposes legislation and meets with diplomats. But more frequently he is the Andrew Dice Clay of chief executives: irresponsible and anxiety-provoking without much regard for the consequences. If an instrument were devised to measure Trump\u2019s mood \u2013 call it a Trumpometer \u2013 it would generally register on the far right-hand side of the scale. This is where \u201cReckless Trump\u201d muses about the \u201cvery fine people\u201d who joined the recent march of the racists in Charlottesville, which culminated in a deadly vehicular attack on anti-hate demonstrators. Heather Heyer died, many more were injured. On the other side of the meter is \u201cScripted Trump,\u201d who we saw address the country on Monday with a call for healing the wounds he had helped open with his callous response to the events in Virginia. Scripted Trump appears when the President is persuaded to accept a little discipline \u2013 and a teleprompter. His first State of the Union speech was delivered with the aid of the machine and he got generally positive reviews. Trump's full speech to crowd in Poland He also used a teleprompter for a speech in Poland, where he called on Russia to \u201cjoin the community of responsible nations,\u201d and to \u201ccease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere.\u201d  Just hours before, however, Reckless Trump refused to accept the national security community\u2019s assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, insisting instead that \u201cI think it was probably other people and/or countries.\u201d By denying the facts about Russia\u2019s effort to influence the election, Trump neglected his duty to defend American democracy and respect the intelligence services that help safeguard the nation.  He did, however, soothe his concern that others might see his election as tainted, and his ego requires this comfort. When Reckless Trump is in the room, it is easy to see that ego is his main concern. It was Reckless Trump who told Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that he had fired FBI Director James Comey, calling him a \u201cnut job.\u201d The Trumpometer was also reading \u201cReckless\u201d when Trump attacked Sen. Mitch McConnell, whom he needs to get legislation passed, and tried to bully Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who helped doom his health care proposal. Although Reckless Trump often sabotages his own agenda, he causes the greatest damage when he indulges himself on an issue that is vital to both public safety and national unity. Trump: Does the 'alt-left' have any guilt? The train wreck of a press conference he conducted at Trump Tower after the Charlottesville tragedy is the most vivid example of this brand of Trump. Irritable and combative \u2013 he often cut others off with \u201cExcuse me!\u201d and complained of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 Trump refused to judge the white nationalists on a \u201cmoral plane\u201d and repeated his argument that blame for the ugliness should be distributed among both the racists and anti-racists. The Trump Tower performance was a wild swing away from the more reasonable statement he had made just the day before. It also fit a pattern. When Trump has chosen to moderate himself, to be more like other presidents, he has often snapped back almost immediately to his more combative identity. For his Monday Afghanistan speech, he pulled himself together for the teleprompter session, which included a reminder that, \u201cloyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people.\u201d After all, this is the man who likes to keep people in suspense, wondering which version of him will appear, which  has the effect of casting doubt upon every statement. Indeed, as if to prove he\u2019s not to be trusted, Trump followed his Monday peacemaking remarks with a trip to Phoenix, where local officials had asked him to stay away because they feared violent protests. President Trump teases pardon of Joe Arpaio What were people upset about? Well, Trump was reportedly considering a pardon for recently convicted ex-sheriff Joseph Arpaio, whose anti-immigrant demagoguery has made him a living symbol of prejudice for many Americans. Trump didn\u2019t announce an Arpaio pardon (although he essentially predicted it would happen) but his rally appearance marked a return of the performer who prefers ad-libbed assertions and insults to unifying leadership \u2013 and discouraged anyone who\u2019d hoped for better from the 45th president. Of course Trump has never made a secret of who he really is. He answered the question in 2016 when he said, on the subject of teleprompters: \u201cI\u2019ve started to use them a little bit. They\u2019re not bad. You never get yourself in trouble when you use a teleprompter. You know, the problem is, it\u2019s too easy. We have a president who uses teleprompters. It\u2019s too easy. We should have non-teleprompter speeches only when you\u2019re running for president. You find out about people. The other way you don\u2019t find out about anybody.\u201d",

He is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cAmerican Dialogue: The Founders and Us.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his. Joseph J. Ellis: Trump's Charlottesville remarks have inadvertently added two big things to our national conversation about race The \"again\" in \"Make America Great Again\" is further back than we realized -- and we're all thinking more about American history Donald Trump\u2019s controversial remarks in the wake of the Charlottesville riots have inadvertently made two significant contributions to our national conversation about race. First, Trump has for the first time clarified what \u201cAgain\u201d means in his campaign slogan \u201cMake American Great Again.\u201d It means before Brown v. Board of Education and the civil rights movement, somewhere around 1950. There had been dog whistles during the campaign to that effect, but he has now sounded his bugle, welcoming white supremacists and Jew-haters back into the political mainstream. This make perfect sense once you think about it. For these \u201cdeplorables,\u201d as Hillary Clinton correctly called them, were always among the most visible participants at his campaign rallies. And they remain a vocal part of the nucleus of his political base. The most shocking fact about Trump\u2019s recent remarks is that we were shocked. After all, Trump achieved credibility as a presidential candidate with the birther lie about Barack Obama, a blatantly racist claim he successfully lifted from the fringes of Breitbart to the mainstream of Fox News. And it worked for him. Here are the Confederate memorials that will be removed after Charlottesville White supremacists and Nazi sympathizers helped make both his nomination and election possible. Without them, and an even larger group of fellow travelers who share their racial prejudices less conspicuously, the Trump presidency might not exist. Taken together they represent a more sizable constituency than previous pollsters were able to find. Credit Trump with informing us that we are a more racist society than we realized. That realization segues into Trump\u2019s second contribution, which is to make us think about American history. In a country where historical illiteracy is the new normal, this is quite an achievement. Even more so since epidemic levels of political correctness at our leading colleges and universities have made discussions of slavery and race too troubling for fragile sensibilities. Trump has inadvertently forced us to face facts that we never knew or preferred to avoid, thereby lifting the lid on the Pandora\u2019s Box of American history. Donald Trump, Martin Luther King Jr. and the backlash against progress Here are some salient questions that will float into view and force difficult debates about the answers: What did the phrase \u201cWe the people\u201d mean in 1787 and what does it mean now? What did the states of the Confederacy claim they were fighting for in the Civil War? And what did their flag symbolize? What does it mean now? What did Jefferson mean when he wrote \u201call men are created equal?\u201d If you went to the Mall in the nation\u2019s capital and listened for the conversation occurring among the memorials to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, what would you hear? The answers to those questions will vary from place to place, even person to person.  In one sense, the fact that we are engaging those questions is more important than the answers we reach. Indeed, argument itself is the answer. That said, one conclusion strikes me as inescapable. Namely, the belief that we are a biracial society in which blacks and white are equal members is a recent idea, first embraced in the middle of the twentieth century. You can search the historical landscape before that time for prominent white political leaders who believed in that goal, and you will not find them.  Our current president wants America to return to its roots, thereby making us great again by recovering our historical identity as a white man\u2019s country. While Trump has almost no understanding of American history, he knows in his gut that a substantial number of the American electorate has never accepted the full implications of the civil rights movement. They are more comfortable with the way we were. In the long run, they are on the wrong side of history, but we\u2019re not there yet.",

He also serves as an adjunct assistant professor at St. John\u2019s University in Queens, New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. James Gagliano: Donald Trump's MS-13 speech made many law enforcement officials uncomfortable Members of law enforcement took an oath to protect and serve -- they must ignore Trump's reckless hyperbole, he writes President Donald Trump\u2019s speech last Friday was ostensibly to lay out the framework for his administration\u2019s policy to confront the violent street gang MS-13. But he strayed from his prepared remarks about combating the gang and raised eyebrows with his clarion call for law enforcement to mistreat citizens in their custody: \u201cWhen you see thugs thrown into the back of a paddy wagon. You just see them thrown in \u2014 rough. I said, \u2018Please don\u2019t be too nice.\u2019\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House press secretary, said Monday that the president was only joking when he made that comment. Regardless of their true intent, the President\u2019s words were irresponsible and reckless. And witnessing the tepid and obligatory applause that he dutifully received from the staged backdrop of uniformed police officers left many former and current law enforcement officials disappointed and uncomfortable with the message. The President has enjoyed rather broad support from the ranks of law enforcement. Members of the thin blue line typically appreciate politicians who pledge to be tough on crime, promise to provide the resources necessary for police to do their jobs and allow all the facts to come in before pronouncing judgment on highly publicized and potentially incendiary officer-involved-shootings. But this support can certainly erode. Policing is a difficult enough job as it is. And we haven\u2019t always been our best advocates. Take the recent case of former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, found in criminal contempt for \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d of a court order against racial profiling. The President\u2019s words serve only to further inflame tensions between many police departments and the communities of color that they serve. So it was exceedingly important for high-ranking police officials to get out in front of the dangerous comments. The real message in Trump's MS-13 speech The Suffolk County Police Department responded almost immediately, \u201cWe do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners.\u201d Even the head of the nation\u2019s largest police force felt compelled to weigh in. James O\u2019Neill, the police commissioner of the New York Police Department, said, \u201cTo suggest that police officers apply any standard in the use of force other than what is reasonable and necessary is irresponsible, unprofessional and sends the wrong message to law enforcement as well as the public.\u201d I have spoken to a number of former FBI colleagues and uniformed police officials. Most echoed O\u2019Neill\u2019s remarks, stating they found the President\u2019s words distasteful. Some attempted to explain it away as \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s just how the President speaks. No one took it seriously.\u201d But I caution that while, perhaps, most will dismiss his comments, what about the few who may take him seriously? And others might also argue that this speech is exactly what law enforcement officials have been waiting for. After all, law enforcement didn\u2019t have a particularly chummy relationship with Barack Obama. And Trump promised during the campaign that he would supply material and moral support to law enforcement ranks that have been demoralized by criticism and opportunistic bashing from multiple circles. Stands to reason that the thin blue line would find this vocal support welcome and refreshing. But the President needs to understand that his popularity with law enforcement must be viewed through the complicated prism that was the 2016 election. In September, Police Magazine conducted a presidential survey that solicited the voting intentions of its 59,238 readers \u2013 all working officers. A total of 3,652 responded. And while 84% stated they supported Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 8% support \u2014 Gary Johnson received 5% of the vote and the last 3% was for \u201cother\u201d \u2014 the more telling statistics are found here. The conversation we need on police shootings 50% of pro-Trump respondents said they supported him because they agreed with his \u201ctough on crime\u201d rhetoric. However, 37% of pro-Trump respondents said they chose him because \u201che is not Hillary Clinton.\u201d This shows that Trump\u2019s support with law enforcement may not be as strong as we might otherwise think \u2013 and it certainly creates fertile ground for dissension. And while his supporters may argue that the applauding uniformed officers positioned behind the president in Suffolk County, New York, were reacting spontaneously and organically, it appears to me that they were as caught off guard as the rest of us. In that scenario, who among us wouldn\u2019t feel compelled to act politely, no matter how taken aback they were by the comments? Law enforcement professionals are taught to honor and respect rank and position. The President needs to understand that what he offered up as \u201csupport\u201d is not what law enforcement is seeking. In other words, law enforcement isn\u2019t seeking the tacit support to mishandle and mistreat our citizens. We want to be supported in a manner befitting a noble profession where the vast majority of us are honorable public servants dedicated to protecting those who require our assistance \u2013 not brutalizing those we have already placed in handcuffs.  Members of law enforcement who took an oath to protect and serve must ignore the reckless hyperbole of a President who appeared to encourage them to flout the rules and disregard the protocols for arrests and custodial treatment of prisoners. Future misconduct by police should never be excused by a citation of the President\u2019s own words. Words matter. And words can be misconstrued. This should frighten all of us as potentially pernicious to the tenuous d\u00e9tente reached between communities and those sworn to protect them.",

Race relations had been growing more tense over the year as Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio announced a series of decisions that had angered the African-American community. Some of the residents who were living across the street from where the arrest took place walked out of their homes to watch the incident. Smith was badly beaten. As the police hauled him to the Fourth Precinct station, word spread within the community about what was happening. African-American taxi drivers sent out reports through their radios. A crowd slowly gathered to monitor and protest Smith\u2019s treatment. Word quickly spread about the arrest and what was taking place inside the station. Violence later erupted in the city and in other cities in the United States, leading to a nationwide debate over policing, race relations, and urban decay that culminated with the release of the historic Kerner Commission Report, which declared that America was moving toward \u201ctwo societies, one white, one black \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d A total of five days of brutal rioting rocked Newark. There were violent clashes between the rioters and the National Guard, who were instructed to use their weapons whenever necessary. One African American man recalled that, as a child living through the riots, \u201cmy mother was so afraid, because she has eight kids, she had us under the bed hiding. I remember bullets and stuff coming through.\u201d A member of the National Guard remembered witnessing a fellow guardsman shoot a teenager who had stolen cigarettes, and his fellow guardsmen assaulting an African-American who was handcuffed. \u201cIt was just like the Wild West,\u201d he said. When the riots ended on July 17, there were 26 people dead and hundreds injured. But this was not the end of chaos for the country. The riots in Newark were followed by equally devastating riots in Detroit and several other smaller cities across the nation. On July 23, undercover police in Detroit raided an unlicensed bar where a crowd of working class African-Americans had gathered to welcome home some returning Vietnam War veterans. The raid sparked five days of rioting. After the police rounded up 82 people, a crowd surrounded the police and yelled: \u201cBlack power. Don\u2019t let them take our people away.\u201d Violence quickly escalated as the officers took the men to jail, and President Johnson signed an order authorizing federal troops to intervene. Forty-three people died, more than a thousand were injured; about seven thousand were arrested. When the Detroit riots ended, the nation was stunned by what had occurred in this turbulent month. The promise of civil rights progress seemed to have fallen apart. Soon after the Kerner Commission produced its shocking report, Richard Nixon was elected President and national politics moved in a more conservative direction. Rather than focusing on reforming our criminal justice system to achieve racial justice, the nation focused on President Nixon\u2019s call to \u201claw and order\u201d\u2013 which entailed more punitive policies and sentencing, the militarization of local police forces, and the expansion of the carceral system. Acquittal in Philando Castile case is deja vu The fiftieth anniversary of these riots is a troubling reminder of the distance that we have not traveled as a nation since the 1960s. Some of the same problems that were evident when violence shook the streets of Newark remain with us today. It would be wrong to say that the nation has not made any improvements since July of 1967. There have been reforms to policing, public attitudes about race have changed, and the growth of African-American representation has changed the political dynamics surrounding these issues. In recent years, these issues received renewed attention when citizens used their smartphones to capture videos of police engaging in violent and lethal behavior against African-American men. The videos spawned the most robust civil rights movement that we have seen in decades with Black Lives Matter, which put criminal justice front and center on the national agenda. Toward the end of President Obama\u2019s term there was even evidence that a bipartisan coalition was taking form to push for legislation addressing this problem. But after the movement built momentum, national politics once again moved in a different direction with the election of President Trump. The problems exposed with the images from Ferguson, Staten Island, Cincinnati and elsewhere have not been addressed. The recent court decisions that freed several police officers involved in the shooting of African-Americans offered further evidence for many civil rights advocates that the final years of the Obama presidency did not bring as much progress as they hoped they would.  Like Richard Nixon, President Trump pushed the national debate about policing in a very different direction. He expressed little sympathy for civil rights advocates and has been vocal about the need to provide full and unquestioning support for existing police and carceral institutions. There is little evidence that reform efforts at the local level are making any headway, either, as was evident with the recent decisions on police incidents that occurred. As a result, we still live with many of the conditions that afflicted African-Americans fifty years ago. The Kerner Commission warned that if we did not take action the situation would only deteriorate and anger would continue to explode into violence. Policymakers and elected officials might want to take a look back at what the report had to say about the outbursts in Newark and Detroit, for their findings are still extremely relevant in our current era.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Bakari Sellers is a former Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and a CNN commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Bakari Sellers: If Democrats want to start winning, they should take a lesson from Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello Instead of giving an exclusively economic message, he is addressing issues of identity politics and social justice as well Who are we? Who is our target demographic? And what do stand for?  These are just a few of the questions Democrats have been attempting to answer since November 8, 2016. And still, after months of reflection, the Democratic Party has made only modest progress in this enduring search for self. However, if we are serious about finding answers to these questions, we must start with our narrative. There is an ill-fated belief trending among party leaders that one overarching message will encompass the infinite number of unique experiences across the country. But the idea that we can promote one message to appeal to the white working class, inspire people of color to vote and urge the growing progressive wing to mobilize is simply baffling. Politics is about people. And while it is critical for Democrats to address the economic anxieties of all Americans, we must speak to people in a way that truly resonates and hits home. To do this effectively, Democrats cannot simply shift to an exclusively economic message, abandoning identity politics and social justice causes. In other words, Democrats must create a multipronged platform that speaks to the financial fears of white voters and the social fears of people of color. And if Democrats need an example of how to effectively speak to all the fears of voters, they need look no further than the gubernatorial Democratic primary taking place in the battleground state of Virginia. Democrats, take your cues from Bernie Sanders A CNN article referred to this June 13 election as \u201cVirginia Democrats face first battle in war for party\u2019s soul.\u201d And, indeed, many have turned this race between Rep. Tom Perriello and Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam into the rematch of Bernie Sanders versus Hillary Clinton. There is the false narrative emerging that Perriello, who has scored the endorsements of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is viewed as representing the progressive wing of the party. In contrast, Northam, a former two-term senator, who has the endorsements of many traditional Virginia Democrats, including Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe, is viewed to represent the more establishment wing of the party. The Democratic Party cannot and should not be summarized as establishment versus progressives. And, more importantly, it cannot win with that kind of rivalry. For example, there are many Clinton supporters who appreciate both candidates for their progressive stances, but are still supporting Perriello because they are drawn to his authentic social justice message, one that\u2019s rooted in understanding the plight of voters of color coupled with tangible policy goals. This message of social justice is even more expansive and thorough than that of his endorsers  Sanders and Warren.  Even during  Sanders\u2019 recent speech at the People\u2019s Summit, he was rightly heavy on economic populism and disappointingly scant of civil rights and social justice. While many continue to pay lip service to the faithful party base, Perriello has created a campaign that moves beyond the rhetoric and is truly responsive to communities of color that are still hurting. Actually, Hillary Clinton makes a good -- and awkward -- point Simply put, Perriello gets it. He understands the blueprint for crafting a message that speaks to disaffected white voters, while also giving voters of color a full-throated reason to come out and vote for his campaign. Democrats clearly made mistakes in 2016; we cannot win by simply ignoring rural America. The frustration from white working-class voters is palpable and just. Our government has failed them, too. However, African-American voters, especially in the South, understand that they do not have the luxury to choose between economic justice and racial justice.  These issues must be coupled together. One without the other is useless. Perriello has not only called for a \u201cCommission on Racial Healing and Transformation,\u201d but he\u2019s gone even further: \u201cWe have to call out racism structural and overt where we see it, and we have to continue to address the issues of deep racial inequality we have here in Virginia, where the median net worth of an African-American family remains 1/11th that of a median white family in Virginia.  We must deal with the structural barriers and have these conversations even when they\u2019re uncomfortable.\u201d This sentiment does not just apply to Virginia, though. It is a microcosm of the plight of black voters across the country. The days of just making Sunday morning church visits and meeting with the so-called leaders of the black community are over. Candidates are now also compelled to give policy-rich objectives and embrace identity politics.  Traditional methods take black voters for granted, and the result is depressed turnout.  In 2012, the Census Bureau said black voters for the first time voted at a higher share than non-Hispanic whites. Contrast that to 2016 black voter turnout, when turnout was down across the board, including swing states like Virginia. If black turnout in these states reached 2012 levels, the result might have been President Clinton and not President Trump. Self-reflection and growth is hard, and it takes time. However, for the sake of the party we must all evolve. And as we move forward, I strongly encourage party leaders to take some notes from Perriello\u2019s playbook.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. D'Antonio: Eric Trump saying Democrats in D.C. \"are not even people\" shows a lack of moral compass similar to his father Trump children have yet to face reality because they've never lived outside comforts provided by their billionaire dad The nation is in a crisis that may soon exceed Watergate, at least in the estimation of James Clapper, former director of national intelligence. Having interfered with America\u2019s election, Russia is disrupting governments around the world. China is racing to fill the gap created as world leaders conclude they cannot expect leadership from the United States. Top intelligence and law enforcement officials are testifying about a White House that crosses ethical lines. And Eric Trump wants us to know that he takes it all very personally. The president\u2019s 33-year-old son was asked Tuesday by Fox News host Sean Hannity, \u201cDon\u2019t you wish you went to Washington so you could be dealing with this every second of every day?\u201d Eric Trump replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen hatred like this. And to me, they\u2019re not even people. It\u2019s so, so sad. I mean, morality\u2019s just gone. Morals have flown out the window. We deserve so much better than this as a country.\u201d But the real pain, he wants us to know, is being felt by his family because, \u201cThey try and obstruct a great man, they try and obstruct his family, they come after us viciously, and it\u2019s truly, truly horrible.\u201d Coming within hours of a report in Forbes that the Trump organization profited from events held to benefit Eric Trump\u2019s cancer charity, young Trump\u2019s complaints match his father\u2019s record of audacity under fire.  (A spokesperson for Eric Trump took issue with the Forbes story and called it \u201ctruly disgusting,\u201d saying, \u201cContrary to recent reports, at no time did the Trump Organization profit in any way from the foundation or any of its activities\u201d and pointing out the charity has raised more than $16.3 million for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.) The President has long practiced the art of throwing stones from glass skyscrapers and it\u2019s obvious the son has learned the lesson well. He also possesses a host of tendencies \u2013 to exaggerate, to personalize and to complain \u2013 that appear to have been direct inheritances. Trump fumes after son halts charity fundraising With roughly 150 words, the youngest son of President Trump and his first wife, Ivana, provided compelling evidence he is as self-impressed and clueless as his father.  Eric Trump has never lived outside the cosseted comfort provided by his billionaire father, and never worked outside the family enterprise. This background is not enough for anyone to consider that his personal experience matters much at all. Eric asking us to give weight to what he has seen reminds one of a 5-year-old who complains he\u2019s never been given the keys to the car and therefore life is terribly unfair. Even if we generously credit Eric for his life experience, we run immediately into his declaration that his father\u2019s critics aren\u2019t really people and that morality has been evicted from the public arena. Nothing in these words, or his expression, suggested that Eric recognized anything ironic about dehumanizing substantial numbers of people in one breath and complaining about the moral climate in another.  And then there\u2019s the question of just who might be responsible for the moral decay that bothers young Trump so much. Were he to consult the record of the recent presidential campaign, his father\u2019s business practices, or his own childhood, Eric Trump could find ample evidence that someone he knows quite well helped lower the standards for the moral example set by public figures. When Eric was still in grammar school his father helped fuel a sex scandal that ended his marriage to Ivana Trump by leaking tidbits to reporters, who made the tawdry details of an affair public. Trump 1989 interview on the 'Central Park Five' It was his own father who fanned the flames of racial tensions during the Central Park Five case, indulged in name-calling to publicly denigrate women, and spoke suggestively about his daughter (Eric\u2019s sister) on the Howard Stern radio show. Donald Trump\u2019s moral compass directed him to exploit unsuspecting consumers with his Trump University and it led him to utter the gross words about molesting women captured by \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d  In politics Donald Trump\u2019s morality moved him to encourage violence at his rallies, mock a disabled reporter, and call for his opponent to be imprisoned. And let\u2019s not forget the cute names he used to describe his opponents. Trump University: The jury is still out Candidate Trump was such an exemplar of moral rectitude that parents were forced to teach their children that he was not a man to be imitated. One would hope that Eric had been taught better, but on Fox he chose to call the head of the Democratic National Committee \u201ca whack job.\u201d In his name-calling, his emotion, his sense of entitlement, and his lack of self-awareness, Eric Trump showed he is every bit his father\u2019s son. Were Donald Trump a noble figure, the prospect of a younger generation devoted to his presidency would be encouraging. However, Trump is proving to be so unfit \u2013 temperamentally, intellectually, and yes, morally \u2013 that the traits that bind the family together are more frightening than reassuring. In the time I spent, while preparing to write a Donald Trump biography, with Eric, his sister Ivanka and his brother Donald Jr. I discovered they all suffered from a lack of experience outside the custom-made universe that revolved around their father.  Like him they had always lived inside the precincts of wealth and power, where it was hard to imagine a problem their father couldn\u2019t fix or a mistake he couldn\u2019t repair. Donald Jr. had worked for about a year in a bar and then joined the family firm. Ivanka had served a similar term in a real estate company headquartered in the same market as the Trump Organization.  Eric had gone straight from college into the family enterprise, but sought to distinguish himself as the charitable one, by talking often about his work on behalf of kids with cancer. Ivanka and Jared's millions won't help them govern As the youngest of the Donald/Ivana kids, Eric expressed the greatest devotion to his father and seemed most committed to the practice of denial that allowed him to tell me, with a straight face, that his father was on a par with Winston Churchill and President Theodore Roosevelt. (This was back when Trump had yet to even say he was entering the 2016 race.) The older siblings were a bit less effusive, and Donald Jr. even confessed that his father rubs many people the wrong way.  (Donald Jr. also stressed the idea that his family could best be understood as a product of breeding, as if the key traits were a matter of blood.)   Not surprisingly, as they sat in their glowing offices, where they commanded their portions of the family empire, nary a word of dissent was ever uttered. The loyalty expressed by Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. has placed them among the President\u2019s most trusted advisers, and it should qualify them to give him a perspective that might help him stop the self-destructive cycle that has paralyzed his administration.  But as the world has prayed for the young Trumps, especially Ivanka, to intervene, they have proven to be inadequate to the task.  Eric\u2019s diatribe is yet another proof that the qualities that may bring ruin to the Trump presidency reside in some of his children as well.",

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. Issac Bailey: People are right to condemn Kathy Griffin's outrageous photo stunt targeting President Trump Conservatives are right to be outraged over Griffin, but when America's history of racism was used to threaten Obama they should have been equally upset, writes Bailey On the day Donald Trump became president, black Americans exhaled as Michelle and Barack Obama got on that Marine One helicopter and flew away from the White House unharmed. In 2008, black Americans quietly worried Obama would be assassinated if he won the presidency, or killed before he could take the oath of office. While they may miss the presence of the first black family in the White House, there were more than a few fist bumps that they got out alive. It\u2019s impossible to quantify, but author and professor Michael Eric Dyson spoke for many when he wrote in the New York Times in January: \u201cNever far from the surface was the fear that some lunatic bigot might put an end to the life of this extraordinary man. Every report of a rogue police force cracking jokes about him raised concerns. Now that his presidency is coming to an end, we can heave a sigh of relief on that point, even as we worry about the efforts of his successor to eviscerate his legacy.\u201d That\u2019s why all fictional, offensive depictions of US presidents being harmed or killed aren\u2019t created equal. Comedian Kathy Griffin\u2019s disgusting \u201cartwork\u201d of a bloodied, severed Trump head was rightly condemned in every corner, when it was released recently. It was disrespectful to the office of the president and represented a new low in the country\u2019s already polarized environment. But it doesn\u2019t come with the historical baggage that accompanied every horrific representation of Obama, whether it be his likeness hung from a noose and burned, as happened in Kentucky during Obama\u2019s run for his first term, or his image being worn as a costume, with a noose around the neck, at a University of Wisconsin football game, as happened last November, just before Election Day. Black congressman threatened with lynching Any threat to any president is a serious matter. It\u2019s an attack on the heart of our democracy. That\u2019s why the Secret Service followed up on threats that shock jocker Ted Nugent made against Obama in 2012, as well as Griffin\u2019s stunt. Americans generally don\u2019t mind their tax dollars being spent to protect first families because they know the history: of an unprotected Abraham Lincoln being shot at a play, for example, and a somewhat better-protected John F. Kennedy being shot in his car and a shooter managing to wound Ronald Reagan, even amid his Secret Service detail. We accept the need to protect the president and that\u2019s as it should be. But it was still different for Obama. He took office in 2009 as the first black man to lead a country that has a history of race-based enslavement, that saw a century of routine lynchings of black men and women (and some white people who supported black civil rights) and endured high-profile killings of civil rights figures, the most prominent being the non-violent Martin Luther King Jr. Kathy Griffin in tears: Trump broke me That\u2019s why when I became the first black person to serve as my newspaper\u2019s first full-time lead columnist in the heart of the South, I\u2019d get weekly calls from elderly black residents saying they would be praying for me \u2013 because they literally thought my life was in danger. Those fears are built upon an American history that reaches back to the curtailing of Reconstruction by violent white mobs, angry that black people had begun making gains in positions of leadership after the end of slavery. Racists in America have often taken black progress as a threat, and nothing signified that more than Obama\u2019s ascension to the presidency. Kathy Griffin's unforgivable message to America and the world When conservatives howled about what Griffin did to a fictional Trump, it was understandable. But that they did not show that outrage about all the times and ways Obama was depicted was deeply disappointing to recall. The problem, of course, is that it is exceedingly difficult to have these discussions with those who have knee-jerk defensive reactions when reminded about these ugly parts of our history and how these events still resonate today. Although all such portrayals should be condemned, some tap into a reservoir of racial hate that we are still grappling with more than other kinds of hate: the Southern Poverty Law Center has documented a spike in race- and ethnic-based incidents since November.  What Griffin did was stupid and reprehensible. The rise in open hatred is more than that. It is dangerous.",

Follow him on Twitter @raceandfood. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Zahir Janmohamed: There is nothing surprising about encountering bigotry in Portland Despite its liberal veneer, Portland is also home to individuals who repeatedly attack people of color, writes Janmohamed A few hours after news broke of the horrific attack on a commuter train in Portland, Oregon, that left two dead and one seriously wounded, I received a text message from a friend in North Carolina. It contained one word: \u201cPortland?!\u201d He was, of course, referring to the incident that happened last Friday where two men were killed after they intervened when a man allegedly yelled at two women in language the Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson described as \u201chate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions.\u201d It even prompted President Trump to condemn the stabbings as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A 35-year-old white supremacist, Jeremy Joseph Christian, has been arrested in connection with the stabbing deaths. I knew what my friend meant by his question: How could such a hateful incident happen in a city as open-minded and as solidly liberal as Portland? I don\u2019t blame him. I thought this myself until I moved to Portland two years ago. For starters, the Portland you see on the TV show \u201cPortlandia\u201d does exist, at least to some extent. The city is delightfully quirky, so much so that I once had a mechanic, after refusing payment for fixing my car headlights, offer me artisanal bookmarks with slogans like \u201cThis Book is More Interesting Than You.\u201d And yes, there really is a massive naked bike ride that I hear is a profound experience in tolerance and self-acceptance. But as a person of color, and especially as a Muslim American, I have never felt so lonely, so unsure of my safety, so eager to flee, as I have in Portland. I was born and raised in California, the son of Indian immigrants from Tanzania, and while I was called a \u201ccamel jockey\u201d plenty of times during the 1990 Gulf War when I was a freshman in high school, I never really feared for my life. Oregon is a different story. Gentrifying Portland: A tale of two cities People have guns here, or at least, bumper stickers indicating that they love guns. I even had an Uber driver show off his gun holster to me. Another Uber driver told me he didn\u2019t like immigrants. It\u2019s seemingly cool for men to carry large pocket knives in Portland, something that I, as a brown man with a beard, would never do. And Oregon is so antiquated in its understanding of race that I once met an elected official here who proudly defended her use of the term \u201cOriental\u201d to refer to Asian Americans. This problem is not new. In 1993, Time magazine wrote, \u201cIn the eyes of a skinhead, Portland, Oregon, looks like the city of the future.\u201d That may be a bit hyperbolic but then again, Portland is the whitest city in America above 500,000, a city that is rapidly losing its black residents due to gentrification. It doesn\u2019t help that Oregon\u2019s history is rooted in racial exclusion and was the only state west of the Mississippi River to ban blacks from owning land \u2013 a policy that lasted until 1926. Things are certainly not getting better, either. In the past year alone, there have been a dizzying number of targeted attacks against people of color. Last year, I reported about the suspicious killing of a 68-year-old Afghan American named Abdul Jamil Kamawal, a leader of the Portland Muslim community, who was murdered in his own backyard, allegedly while Kamawal was performing his prayers. A 27-year-old white man, Michael Troxell, was arrested and booked into the Washington County Jail pending murder charges. He\u2019s being held without the possibility of bail, though this incident is not being investigated as a hate crime. Remembering the Portland stabbing victims This March, a white man ran into a Middle Eastern restaurant in the state\u2019s capitol of Salem, threatening the staff, yelling, \u201cGet out of America.\u201d In the same month, an Iranian refugee in Troutdale, Oregon, returned home to find the words \u201cterrorist\u201d spray-painted on his wall. More recently, a group of about 100 white supremacists marched on the street outside my office in Portland \u2013 located in the most heavily populated Asian area in the entire state of Oregon \u2013 and chanted, \u201cGo home!\u201d to the onlookers, most of whom were Asian business and home owners. After clashes erupted with counter-protesters, the police sent in a riot squad, and three were arrested. It is still unclear which side those arrested were on. President Trump\u2019s win is not solely to blame. These incidents have been happening for decades. But it would be foolish not to see a correlation between his election and the rise of bigotry in Oregon. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Oregon witnessed the highest number of harassment and intimidation incidents per capita in the 10 days immediately following the November elections. There were 33 incidents during that period, making Oregon 10th in the nation for these kind of incidents. However, all the states with more reported incidents have larger populations than Oregon\u2019s 4 million people. The challenging thing is that many Oregonians shut down when talking about race, and sometimes I do not know what is more mind-numbing: learning of these incidents or dealing with the state\u2019s many white liberals who always shush me when I talk about race because they remind me that Oregon is not a \u201cred state\u201d or that \u201cthings are worse elsewhere in America.\u201d What does that even mean? And who even cares? I don\u2019t live \u201celsewhere in America.\u201d  I have, after all, lost count of how many Muslims, especially teenage black Muslim women, have confided in me that they have been threatened on public transportation, that they have had their head scarves pulled while walking home at night, that they have been called \u201cISIS lovers\u201d while walking on their public high school campuses. What is worse, they tell me, is that their teachers often trivialize their concerns. Of course, it is heartwarming to see the outpouring of support for the two men who were killed and for the one man who was injured, heroes who selflessly and courageously stood up to hate. Their loved ones deserve all the funds we can give, and I am grateful that Portland has come out so strongly to unite against this bigotry. What I do not understand, though, is all the head-scratching, both within Oregon as well as across the United States, as to how such a bigoted attack could occur in Portland. From where I am standing, people of color have been attacked at such a frequent rate in Portland that I find myself just about ready to quit this city.",

He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Peniel Joseph: If Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, and dozens of now-familiar names tell us anything, it's that we still have lessons left unlearned from the Los Angeles uprising in 1992 This week marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, which exploded following the acquittal of four LAPD officers charged with the brutal videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. The riot, which activists characterized as an urban rebellion, triggered echoes of the past with an updated twist: Similar allegations of police brutality had sparked massive unrest in Harlem, Watts, Newark, and Detroit during the 1960s. In Los Angeles, the instigating incident aired on national television in a manner that anticipated the technologically-connected era of Black Lives Matter and the upsurge of racial violence in 21st-century Ferguson, Baltimore, and other cities. While the video recording of Rodney King may have been a forerunner to what we have watched unfold live (on screens large and small) with the Black Lives Matter movement, it\u2019s also clear that we need to take a harder look at what happened in L.A. 25 years ago. Because if Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, and dozens of now-familiar names tell us anything, it\u2019s that we still have lessons left unlearned from the Los Angeles uprising in 1992. In an era before social media and smart phones, most Americans relied on newspaper, radio, and television reports to understand the scope of the unrest that gripped a panicked city for several days after the April 29 not guilty verdict of four white officers. Arsenio Hall, the popular black late night television host, insisted on taping his show at First AME Church over the objections of studio executives skittish over outbreaks of violence that law enforcement seemed unable to contain. During the hour-long taping, Hall presided over one of the most powerful hours of television produced during the 1990s, opening the show with an excerpt of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech at 1963\u2019s March On Washington, interviewing Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, and trying to parse the connections people were just beginning to make among racial violence, poverty, the drug war, and institutional racism. The riot\u2019s second night coincided with the finale of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d the long running sitcom about an upper middle class black family that became for several seasons the most watched show in the nation. The show, which premiered during Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term, inaugurated the nation\u2019s initial flirtation with the post-racial ideal that would be in full bloom with the election of Barack Obama. Los Angeles\u2019 explosion of violence cast doubt on the idea of colorblindness a quarter of a century ago, just as Ferguson permanently exploded this myth in our time. The decision by the \u201cArsenio Hall Show\u201d to scrap regular programming to focus on the meaning and historical context of the riots made events in Los Angeles a national touchstone for long gestating debates about race, civil rights, and justice that now transcended conventional politics. In 1992, America\u2019s elected leaders failed to comprehend the magnitude of the nation\u2019s racial crisis, with President George H.W. Bush expressing shock at the verdict, but ignoring the systemic issues of poverty, criminalization of black bodies, and racism that led to the violence, looting, and chaos in the city. The LA riots were a rude awakening for Korean-Americans Arkansas governor and then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton (who would appear on Arsenio Hall\u2019s show in early June) offered powerful words while visiting Los Angeles several days after the riots began. \u201cWe are not honestly confronting problems of race and poverty and differences among the American people,\u201d he candidly admitted to audiences at several Los Angeles-area African American churches. Clinton\u2019s comments suggested that a presidential candidate finally understood the pain carried by black Americans who resided in segregated neighborhoods wracked by crime, violence, and drug abuse on one hand, and a criminal justice system that further dehumanized whole communities through racial profiling, police brutality and violence on the other. Would the man that Toni Morrison labeled the nation\u2019s \u201cfirst black president\u201d turn his uncanny ability to express personal empathy into transformative social justice policy on behalf of black people? Not exactly. As President Clinton supported a series of draconian policies that helped incarcerate more black men at the federal level than Ronald Reagan did, those policies became the blueprint for America\u2019s egregious system of mass incarceration, and further punished the formerly convicted and their families by denying housing, employment opportunities, and food to predominantly black and brown Americans caught up in the drug war. While serving as a high-profile surrogate for his wife\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, former President Clinton admitted to supporting policies that \u201covershot the mark\u201d by incarcerating too many people of color. Los Angeles in 1992 represented both a missed opportunity and a sign of the times. Two decades before the death of Trayvon Martin inspired the creation of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag that in turn ignited a national movement for racial justice, Los Angeles drew a more scattered response from civil rights activists, amplified racial fatigue among white Americans, and quickly became more comfortably understood as a cultural touchstone \u2013 one mined by creative artists for exploration in film, music, television and novels \u2013 rather than a political one. Anna Deveare Smith\u2019s \u201cTwilight: Los Angeles, 1992\u201d remains the singular production that has tried to make sense of the riots\u2019 enormous impact on American culture. A range of black filmmakers, most notably Spike Lee and John Singleton, also utilized the rebellion as a motif in shaping their cinematic imagination.  The legacy of the LA rebellion continues to reverberate as evils have come to light in cities like Baltimore and Cleveland and smaller municipalities such as Ferguson. A quarter-century later, mass incarceration and institutionalized racism have grown more entrenched but fortunately so has the political consciousness of a new generation of activists. For these young people, staying \u201cwoke\u201d means continuing to connect the dots between racism, poverty, and the criminal justice system in ways that earlier generations of politicians and political leaders often failed to do. Their tireless efforts to ensure that black lives do indeed matter stand as an elegantly poignant answer to Rodney King\u2019s plaintive question as Los Angeles and America collectively tasted the ashes of racial injustice: \u201cCan\u2019t we all just get along?\u201d",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Peggy Drexler: It's easy to blame the patriarchy for a society that remains far more favorable to men But a significant part of that patriarchy is made up of, and encouraged by, women, writes Drexler Organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington carried out their supported action \u2014 a day, in fact, of nonaction \u2014 this week. The \u201cDay Without a Woman\u201d was an international strike on March 8, a one-day \u201cdemonstration of economic solidarity\u201d in which women and their allies refrain from paid and unpaid work. They also vowed to buy nothing (unless it\u2019s from small, female- and minority-owned businesses) and to wear red as a show of collective strength. \u201cMarch 8 will be the beginning of a new international feminist movement that organizes resistance not just against Trump and his misogynist policies,\u201d reads the website for the strike, \u201cbut also against the conditions that produced Trump, namely the decadeslong economic inequality, racial and sexual violence, and imperial wars abroad.\u201d But is that what it will take? The activism that has sprung up in response to the election of President Trump has been monumental, mobilizing many women who had never considered themselves activists \u2014 or even, come to think of it, disenfranchised. But January\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington proved there were millions around the world who objected to many of the messages inherent in Trump\u2019s victory and in the first days of his presidency. There have been other resistance movements, smaller but no less significant, including the group 500 Women Scientists, established in response to Trump\u2019s anti-science, anti-women rhetoric, as well as a surge in support for groups that work to elect female politicians, like EMILY\u2019s List and Elect Her. And yet these movements also serve to expose the sorts of rifts that enabled a Trump victory in the first place. They do this not just by pitting pro- against anti-Trump, but by assuming all women share the same goals about equality, and how to get there. The truth, and the challenge to marchers \u2014 and to women \u2014 is that while it\u2019s easy enough to blame the patriarchy for a society that remains far more favorable to men, a significant part of that patriarchy is made up of, and encouraged by, women. What if Trump isn\u2019t the problem? What if it\u2019s us? Why GOP plans on health care will hurt all women Consider this: Equal rights movements are not new. Three waves of feminism have mobilized women for decades. The fact is that, whether all women felt the effects or not, the current discord within the gender didn\u2019t start with the election and it doesn\u2019t end there. The election simply highlighted what had been overlooked for years, that as women tick off certain boxes on the march toward equality (as in, the growing number of female CEOs, growing number of self-made female billionaires, growing number of women achieving positions previously available exclusively to men) and seem to grow their collective force, there\u2019s a force just as great working to bring them down. And that force is women. On the surface, few women could reasonably object to the goals of the Women\u2019s Strike, which is to recognize the importance of women in society, as workers, caregivers and active participants in the economic system, while also recognizing that these same women experience greater inequities than men. They are paid less and more vulnerable to discrimination, sexual harassment and job insecurity. But modern feminism is disorganized, and even in its best intentions, exclusionary. And as many have begun to point out in the context of the strike, skipping work is a luxury that not everyone has. \u201cThis seems a bit elitist to me,\u201d writes one follower on the Women\u2019s March\u2019s Instagram post promoting the day. \u201cHow does encouraging women to not go to work that day empower them?\u201d Writes another: \u201cI am a mom to a special needs boy & can\u2019t not take him to his therapy. My husband is unable to take day off from work.\u201d Those who counter these cries say activism isn\u2019t practical, or convenient, and that change doesn\u2019t come to those who sit around wishing for it. 'Strong is the New Pretty' celebrates girls -- and the inner-child in us all But for many, calling in \u201cwoman\u201d to the office, or the carpool lane, is simply not an option. And to expect it to be or else you\u2019ve got no place in the movement is dangerous. Because those women who can\u2019t take part, or feel they can\u2019t, are those who most need to be reached. Once they feel the movement doesn\u2019t represent them, they\u2019ll be the ones who turn their backs on it first. That\u2019s when the judging starts. And whether in the workplace, at the playground, at a cocktail party, or within a \u201csolidarity\u201d movement, people love to judge. And divide. Inevitably, on Wednesday, there will be women who cross the picket line, who must go to the office or who buy a carton of milk from the male-run corner market. What then? Outrage is important, but outreach is what will create change.  And then, of course, there is the even darker truth lurking behind the Trump-inspired women\u2019s movements: They may not work because many women don\u2019t want them to work. These are women who are eager to prove to the Sheryl Sandbergs of the world that doing more doesn\u2019t make it better; women who are perhaps happy to let their husbands bear the burden of breadwinning, or ladder climbing, or struggle. These are the women who voted for Trump, convinced that leaning in didn\u2019t work, or wasn\u2019t for them. Now we\u2019ve got an administration quickly establishing itself as a foe to women, voted into power largely by the very people whose power he\u2019s threatening to undo. We let it happen. How could we, then, possibly expect to stop it?",

The opinions in this article belong to the author. Jill Dougherty: Trump's love affair with Putin is playing out well for Russia and Putin's candidacy for the 2018 elections Trump's travails can serve the Kremlin's ambitions: A message to the world that the US is a shambles, she writes For weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s election, \u201cTrumpomania\u201d ruled the Russian airwaves. State-controlled media were besotted with the rich American who didn\u2019t insult their President or lambaste their country for human rights violations \u2013 who actually thought it would be \u201cnice\u201d if Russia and America \u201cgot along.\u201d Russian TV carried more news about Trump than about Vladimir Putin. It seemed only a matter of time before Trump would lift economic sanctions on Russia and join hands with Putin to fight terrorism. But the sanctions stayed in place. Trump started Tweeting about winning an arms race. His UN ambassador condemned Moscow for annexing Crimea. Then came \u201cKremlinGate.\u201d Russia mystery threatens to consume Washington In Moscow, the love affair is cooling. State media are dialing down the temperature on Trump \u2013 fast. Whole newscasts go by without a word about him. Like a spurned lover telling a friend how it all went wrong, Kremlin spinmeisters are trying to make sense of it all for Russian viewers. They\u2019re not blaming Trump, yet, although hints of dissatisfaction at his management style sometimes creep in. Instead, they\u2019re reaching back in their propaganda playbook for some tried-and-true tropes about the United States. Master media showman Dmitry Kiselev, in his weekly TV program \u201cNews of the Week,\u201d gave a textbook vision of why Trump isn\u2019t delivering on his promise to improve the relationship with America. The \u201coligarchic media\u201d \u2013 the same ones Trump has called \u201cenemies of the American people,\u201d Kiselev noted \u2013 are at war with the new president, determined to bring him down. \u201cRadical liberals\u201d won\u2019t accept the results of the election and are \u201cplotting a revolution\u201d. Even a mention of Russia by Trump or his administration carries \u201chigh political risk.\u201d If this sounds vaguely familiar, that\u2019s because you have heard it before. Soviet Cold War propaganda employed similar themes. Exploiting America\u2019s real faults, like racial and economic inequality, it depicted the United States as a hell-on-Earth for poor people and minorities. The country was run by the rich, usually depicted as fat men in top hats and striped pants. America\u2019s proletariat had no chance to change the system. True, fitting Trump into this picture takes some creative cutting and pasting. After all, he is rich and so are most of his top officials. So the Kremlin has had to redefine who runs America. Mr Moneybags is out; the \u201coligarchic media\u201d is in. Cribbing a word usually used to describe billionaire Russian businessmen, the Kremlin-controlled media now quote Trump and his favorite phrase  \u201cfake media.\u201d The Kremlin\u2019s media messaging is borrowing other expressions from the US President. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov decries \u201cmedia hysterics\u201d in the United States. Dmitry Kiselev says \u201cradical liberals\u201d are working against the President. Russia's take on Trump: Glee gives way to frustration Why is the Kremlin so interested in US democracy? Like their Soviet ancestors, it\u2019s a way to kill at least two birds with one stone. Moscow gets to criticize the United States as a fake democracy. Like Trump during the presidential campaign, it can call it a rigged system. Any lessons about democracy the United States wants to teach the world are bogus. The US media are \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2013 ironically, a phrase used from the earliest days of the Bolshevik revolution. The Russian state media\u2019s persecution of Trump theme also gives the Kremlin a chance to warn Russian citizens that it could happen at home. We\u2019ve heard before about radical liberals want to bring down Vladimir Putin. Divided societies are doomed. Enemies are out to rock the boat and carry out a silent coup.  All this is playing out in Russia against the backdrop of its own political drama: the 2018 presidential campaign, in which Vladimir Putin is expected to run again. Trump isn\u2019t Putin. The Kremlin knows that only too well. Trump\u2019s lack of discipline, his unpredictability, his incapacity to grab the reins and run the United States the way he wants to do not bode well for attaining Russia\u2019s objectives. But, at this point, Trump\u2019s travails can serve the Kremlin\u2019s ambitions: a message to the world that the United States is a shambles, a message to the Russian people that the only way to ride out the coming storm is to stick with Putin.",

His latest book is \u201cNew and Collected Poems, 1975-2015.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Charles Murray's appearance at Middlebury College sparked protest that turned violent Jay Parini: It's important in Trump era not to use bullying tactics to color tone of talks Charles Murray came to the campus of Middlebury College (where I\u2019ve taught for more than 30 years) on Thursday, and his appearance provoked protests that went beyond anything seen here since the 1960s. All hell broke loose, as hundreds of students turned their backs on Murray, a political scientist with controversial views, and began to chant: \u201cWho is the enemy? White supremacy!\u201d and \u201cRacist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray, go away!\u201d Unable to deliver his talk, the speaker was spirited to another location, where he engaged in a discussion moderated by a member of the government department. On their way to a waiting car, Murray and the professor escorting him were confronted by protesters. Pushing and shoving quickly degenerated into outright violence, and the professor who moderated the event, Allison Stanger, was injured and taken to a hospital. (She is a good friend of mine, and is, thankfully, OK.) Decline in values to blame for inequality? Murray is, of course, co-author of the 1994 book \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d \u2013 a contentious and largely discredited study of intelligence and its variations within American society.  Writing in The New Yorker, Stephen Jay Gould \u2013 the late Harvard evolutionary biologist \u2013 wrote that the argument in this book about intelligence and racial difference is \u201cas old as the study of race, and is most surely fallacious.\u201d After nearly 25 years, Murray\u2019s thesis holds very little water, although he remains a hero of sorts among some commentators on the right.  Needless to say, he is not much liked on the left. Indeed, the Southern Poverty Law Center lambastes Murray for using \u201cmisleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of black and Latino communities, women and the poor.\u201d They quote him in various contexts, and it\u2019s not pleasant reading. Despite all of this, Murray does not seem a likely target for protests of the kind that happened at Middlebury. He was, in effect, brought out of cold storage for this talk, a relic of the era when the debate over political correctness first began to boil in the mid-\u201990s. A student group had invited him, and (wisely) the government department at the college decided to co-sponsor the event. Two large questions, for me, arise. First, why were the students so upset? And then, why did they behave so badly? Students lower flag in election protest I spend most of my weekdays in conversation with students, and I know they\u2019re upset by the election of a bigoted man to the White House, someone who consistently derided Mexicans (among others) during his run for the presidency. That he is a self-confessed serial assaulter of women remains a point of agitation for many, even if he insists his account of this behavior was just locker-room talk. His bullying tactics with anyone who opposes him or his ideas have rattled students, who see him as the antithesis of what people in the \u201cacademic village\u201d consider appropriate in presidential behavior. At Middlebury, like elsewhere on campuses, many students are extremely conscious of assaults to the environment, and \u2013 to them \u2013 Trump represents a huge threat, someone who can undo years of progress. You get the idea. They have a lot to upset them. But I was nonetheless startled by their rude behavior, their refusal even to hear Charles Murray speak. One can perhaps excuse the students on grounds of immaturity. But that\u2019s not good enough. They must learn to listen, learn how to object in a proper, well-reasoned way to arguments that seem, after consideration, wrong, even repugnant. It is especially important in the Trump era that we don\u2019t allow bullying tactics to color the tone of discussions. There are ways to talk about important things and appropriate ways to protest. And some forms of protest only provoke thoughtless reactions and bad feelings. Students, and their elders as well, must not lose sight of these distinctions.",

Michael D'Antonio: Isolated by wealth and power, Trump's oblivious to his prejudices Now he's responsible for leading a diverse nation, that excuse won't work, he says By now we should all be accustomed to the way that Donald Trump twists almost everything to make it about him \u2013 personally \u2013 and not about whatever issue is at hand. This is especially true when he takes questions from reporters, who may be the only people in his life who consistently challenge him, and even more particularly when the issue is bigotry. His answer will invariably begin with a preamble that calls attention to his own greatness, in politics or business or both, after which he will respond he is the \u201cleast racist\u201d or \u201cleast anti-Semitic\u201d person one could ever meet and that should settle it. Clearly, the Trump administration has a problem with Jews The denial Trump practices whenever he is criticized about this is a serious problem for him and the country. On a personal level, it makes it difficult for him to accept his mistakes and make corrections. For the nation, this problem means that in the coming four years, and perhaps eight, we won\u2019t have the kind of leadership that brings a diverse country together in peace.

I think he is instead a man who has been so isolated by wealth, power and his own moral laziness that he has never grown out of the 1950s racial mentality of his youth in Queens. As any New Yorker knows, the melting pot metropolis Trump came up in is so diverse that people of different races, religions, ethnic groups and other identities rub up against each other all day long. The friction can create heat. In the past the heat led to stereotypes, which people deployed with varying degrees of ignorance and animus. Trump is a man of that past, whose family\u2019s business was accused by the Justice Department of racially profiling rental applicants and who once sourly told interviewer Bryant Gumbel about how affirmative action made it better to be a \u201cwell-educated \u201d black man than to be white. How Trump can bridge the racial divide Throughout his life Trump has expressed similar ideas while insisting he harbors no prejudice against specific groups. In general he has been able to walk a line that separates rhetoric from racism, but his steps have not been perfect. During the presidential campaign, he wavered on the subject of his racist supporter David Duke and dismissed the Black Lives Matter movement before pivoting to dilute the movement\u2019s message by declaring \u201call lives matter.\u201d In both cases, Trump crossed the line into racist territory, signaling to certain white voters that he saw the world as they do. At the same time, Trump has a problem with rudeness. When he ordered a Jewish reporter asking about anti-Semitism to \u201csit down\u201d  at a recent news conference, he was acting as a boor, and not a racist. His request at the same news conference that a black female journalist arrange a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus was all kinds of awful. It was a display that could be deemed sexist, bullying and insulting. But the racism in it was likely more a matter of Trump\u2019s lack of education and narcissism than hatred. Workers to strike for 'Day Without Immigrants' As a billionaire surrounded by yes men and yes women, Trump has rarely mixed with people who might challenge his view of the world.  This is why he\u2019s disturbed when people call out his insulting statements. No one I care about ever complains like this, he thinks to himself. These people criticizing me now must be out to get me In Trump\u2019s lifetime, America\u2019s main moral challenge has been to meet the call from those who would have the country live up to its ideal of liberty and justice for all. This challenge was posed by Jewish Americans in the wake of the Holocaust, minority citizens during the civil rights movement that gathered force in the 1960s and the women\u2019s rights movement that followed. More recently lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, and immigrants, authorized and unauthorized, have asked to be included. Trump shows his true hand on LGBTQ rights For those who have full rights, and full access to the blessing of the nation, those seeking the same recognition and inclusion represent a test. This is especially true for \u201chigh-status\u201d citizens who, by virtue of being white, male, able-bodied, heterosexual, wealthy, Protestant and well-educated have great advantages in the American game of life.  The more of these boxes one can tick off, the more of a head start one enjoys. Many high-status Americans have had the moral capacity and, in some cases, experienced enough struggle to open their hearts to their fellow citizens and develop the habit of justice. This has been true of most modern presidents, too. Take, for example, George W. Bush, who was born to enormous wealth, power and privilege. Bush lived a relatively broad life and could consider his own battle with alcoholism to understand what it means to be a victim of something beyond one\u2019s control. Hence Bush\u2019s concern for public schools, evidenced by his No Child Left Behind program.  Trump, who has known every status advantage and little pain, other than against self-inflicted wounds, has shown little sign he can overcome the isolation of his privilege. Throughout his life and during the election campaign, he played to white grievance and racial divisions.  As President, he has \u2013 save for a few token appointments \u2013 surrounded himself with people who are similarly lacking in experience outside the isolated precincts of astounding and, for the most part, unearned privilege In business, Trump\u2019s failure to understand the problem of bigotry mattered little. As President his ways of talking about it \u2013 and, more importantly, his actions \u2013 matter enormously. His stalled plan to ban visitors from certain Muslim-majority countries, his moves against unauthorized immigrants and his retreat on the rights of transgender citizens, all speak of a personal shortcoming that goes beyond a way of talking. Instead of healing divisions he is widening them because, thus far, he hasn\u2019t developed the habits of a heart that can give the country better.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sophia A. Nelson is an award-winning author and journalist and former House GOP committee counsel from 1997-1999. She is the author of the new book, \u201cE Pluribus One: Rediscovering Our Founders\u2019 Vision for a United America.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Sophia A. Nelson: President Donald Trump has thus far failed to make inroads in the African-American community But if Trump can build critical relationships with black leaders and constituents, he can make great strides in bridging the racial divide On Tuesday, President Donald Trump honored Black History Month by visiting the newly-minted National Museum of African American History and Culture. Amid the fanfare and praise that Trump\u2019s visit was \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d one question still remains: Is he serious about fixing the racial divide in this country? With a rise in anti-Semitic and racist incidents since the November election, the President has come under increasing pressure to respond. And given Trump\u2019s comments on the sorry state of black America, he should feel an urgency to act. On the campaign trail, Trump often invoked the phrase \u201cliving in hell,\u201d when describing US inner cities and the poverty and gun violence that often plagues black communities in them. And upon taking office last month, the President threatened Chicago officials on Twitter, declaring that \u201cIf Chicago doesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u2018carnage\u2019 going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\u201d Now 30 days into the new Trump administration, where is he with black Americans, and where does he need to go? Let me start by saying I do not think Trump is a racist. I think he is ignorant when it comes to people of color, their experiences and how to properly engage with them. That ignorance was on full display earlier this month when he seemed not to know who Frederick Douglass was, and then, during his Feb. 16 press conference at the White House, had a shocking and awkward nationally televised exchange with veteran White House reporter April Ryan. Ryan asked the President a question about his promise to improve urban communities. He praised her question as \u201cvery professional and very good,\u201d and when she followed up with another question on whether he planned to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus, he replied: \u201cDo you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?\u201d A day later, Trump fired Shermichael Singleton, one of the few African Americans in his administration and a political appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, following a criticism Singleton made of Trump in an October 2016 op-ed. Notably, Trump has not fired any white employees for gaffes in the press. Like your uncle making inappropriate comments at family functions, Trump publicly says predictably offensive things about women, blacks and others, with apparently little clue that the world around him has changed since he was a teenager. These displays of cultural ignorance serve as a huge barrier for the President. But they can be overcome with a bit of self-reflection and some additional attention given to the voices of black constituents. You've committed the graver sin, Senator Scott Until earlier this month, it seemed Trump might actually be poised to make inroads with the African-American community (and the Congressional Black Caucus), in light of news that his administration was considering increasing support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), coupled with his avowed focus on creating jobs, safer communities and better educational opportunities for African Americans. In order for these changes and improvements to happen, Trump, however, has to get out of his own way. He must find the self-discipline to study, prepare and familiarize himself with the ways of Washington DC power brokers and the constituents they answer to. If he has any shot of reaching out to African-Americans, in particular, he must begin with the Congressional Black Caucus, which represents black members in Congress. He must treat reporters like Ryan and others who represent black media with respect. He must sit with black media outlets and talk directly to their audiences, and then he should listen \u2013 really listen \u2013 to their thoughts and fears. Of course, Trump can\u2019t go it alone. Omarosa Manigault, Trump\u2019s director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison, Dr. Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development nominee and other black advisors need to do a better job preparing the President to speak on issues of diversity. They let him make a fool of himself by not knowing who Frederick Douglass was, or worse, how to get in touch with the CBC. But there\u2019s much more Trump can do to better serve African Americans. For example, he could go on an urban listening tour with HUD Secretary Ben Carson (once he is confirmed) and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Or he could make time to appear on black TV and radio networks and shows, like WHUR in DC, TV One, BET, the Tom Joyner Morning Show, etc. He could engage with black college presidents, business leaders and state and local officials who can help him understand the realities on the ground and inform the policy recommendations he makes.  And he could hire African-Americans with more political experience than former reality TV star Omarosa, who has no real alliances in the black community to help her succeed. Ironically, Trump is a man who could probably be a decent president if he would settle down, take issues seriously and focus on the job at hand. The CBC could be an ally on HBCU and urban reform. In fact, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings and others from the CBC have indicated they are looking forward to meeting with the President and working with him. Bottom line: If Trump wants to fix America\u2019s great racial divide, he needs to stop being a roadblock to his own success.",

Follow him @deanofcomedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Trump's attempt to delegitimize the federal judiciary is terrifying, says Dean Obeidallah Trump seems intent on bypassing our system of checks and balances, he writes On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump may have unleashed his most bone-chilling tweet  \u2013 at least to those who believe the United States should not become a Trump-led dictatorship. And I don\u2019t make that comment simply to be provocative or without giving it a great deal of thought. Our democracy is far more fragile than some might grasp and Trump is engaging in a concerted effort to undermine the workings of it. Here is Trump\u2019s truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Why is this so concerning? It\u2019s OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn\u2019t have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a \u201cso-called\u201d judge while arguing that his decision is \u201cridiculous.\u201d Facts still matter on US terror threat Let\u2019s be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it. The President truly appears to be leading a master class in transforming the United States into a dictatorship. Trump \u2013 and it\u2019s fair to assume it is by design \u2013 has sought to undermine anyone or anything that tries to counter him. Judge's refugee ban ruling raises more questions than it answers First, Trump has made the media \u2013 which is a watchdog of our presidents \u2013 a focus of his attacks, calling them \u201cdishonest,\u201d claiming they peddle \u201cfake news\u201d and even recently labeling them \u201cthe opposition party.\u201d The practical result is that when the media calls out Trump\u2019s lies and presents objective facts to counter him, his followers will likely dismiss the media reports and instead side with Trump. Then Trump went after our intelligence agencies because he didn\u2019t agree with their views on Russia\u2019s involvement in our recent election. Trump lashed out, calling these agencies, charged with gathering information for our national security, \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and accusing them of leaking information, comparing it to \u201csomething that Nazi Germany would have done.\u201d Trump refugee ban bringing religious faiths together Trump has clearly begun the process of destroying their credibility so if they come forward in the future to oppose his views or offer facts to undermine his position, he will tell his followers they also aren\u2019t to be believed. And now Trump, who attacked a judge during his campaign, citing his Mexican heritage, has turned on our judiciary again. But this time it\u2019s far more disturbing given Trump is not a candidate, but president of the United States. The rationale must be assumed to be the same, namely that Trump wants to delegitimize the judiciary so that court decisions Trump disagrees with will be viewed by his followers as at the least horribly partisan, or at worst invalid. Immigration ban? We were there exactly 100 years ago today It\u2019s frightening to think where this could lead. For example, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in the historic case of Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in our public schools was unconstitutional, it took then-President Dwight Eisenhower to implement that decision. Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus had refused to follow the Court\u2019s decision and instead surrounded an all-white high school in his state with National Guard troops to prevent its integration. Eisenhower responded by federalizing the Arkansas National Guard to enforce the Supreme Court\u2019s seminal decision and allow black students to attend the school.  Would Trump do the same if he had passionately disagreed with the Court\u2019s decision or would he simply ignore it while attacking the legitimacy of our judiciary, sparking a constitutional crisis? And would certain Trump-supporting federal agency heads, or even federal officers, refuse to follow court orders (or at least do it very slowly) because Trump has convinced them the federal judiciary\u2019s decisions cannot be trusted? There\u2019s no doubt Trump supporters are very loyal to him personally.  Keep in mind that Trump infamously bragged that he could even shoot a person on Fifth Avenue in New York and his supporters would still be on his side. And according to a CNN/ORC poll, while Trump has only a 44% approval rating overall, 90% of Republicans think he\u2019s doing a good job. The Founding Fathers enshrined a separation of powers in our Constitution so that there would be inherent checks and balances to avoid a situation where a president could become a king. After all, the Founders had just risked life and limb rebelling against the King of England. Trump\u2019s concerted attacks to delegitimize our media, our intelligence community and now our federal judiciary would have no doubt alarmed them. And it should be terrifying to every American who truly believes in our Constitution and in the promise of America.",

He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Peniel Joseph: Trump's version of Black History Month turns our unfolding national racial tragedy into a reality TV farce He writes: Trump's comments on Douglass aren't only evidence of a need for more and better black history at the White House During what he characterized as \u201cour little breakfast\u201d to celebrate Black History Month, President Donald J. Trump, without the least hint of irony, awkwardly praised Frederick Douglass, the nineteenth-century black abolitionist \u201cis an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d Trump\u2019s language prompted immediate speculation that Trump might not know Douglass had been dead since 1895. Twitter lit up with ridicule, with Trump drawing eye-rolls from academics and celebrities alike. The volume and tone of the response to Trump\u2019s remarks is owed in no small part to the President\u2019s open and successful courting of the alt-right during his campaign, and elevation of Steve Bannon to a position of power inside the White House. It\u2019s particularly jarring to hear Trump speak this way about Douglass, the former slave who penned a best-selling autobiography, who developed a friendship with President Abraham Lincoln and became one of the era\u2019s leading public speakers and critics of slavery and racial injustice. Douglass is perhaps best known for his 1852 address, \u201cThe Meaning of July 4 for the Negro.\u201d In that speech Douglass contrasted Independence Day celebrations promoting freedom and liberty with racial slavery and subjugation that, he argued, crippled America\u2019s democratic aspirations. Douglass\u2019 speech seems particularly resonant in our current moment. It reminds us that Black History Month matters more than ever. In the age of Trump, Black History Month provides ballast against the President\u2019s two-faced efforts \u2013 on full display at the breakfast \u2013 to portray himself as a civil rights champion by ham-fistedly invoking the memory of America\u2019s most revered black abolitionist even as he\u2019s aligned himself, in both word and deed, with the kind of white nationalists who Douglass spent his life opposing. Donald Trump and Steve Bannon's coup in the making Black History Month, created by the Harvard trained black historian Carter G. Woodson as Negro History Week in 1926, is more vital in our own times than ever for at least three reasons. Its descriptive intervention allows us to embrace the fullness of American and world history on a previously unimagined scale. By allowing the voices of black women and men, icons and ordinary people, to join in our larger democratic story, we come to see how African-Americans expansively transformed the United States. The struggle for black dignity, both its triumphs and travails, offers a universal story through the particular experiences of African-Americans, one that immigrants, women, people of color and LGBTQ communities can all relate to. Black history is also prescriptive; it offers a window into how civil rights struggles can fundamentally change democratic institutions for all people. Black politicians after Reconstruction passed legislation that led to public schools. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited gender discrimination that has aided millions of white women and helped to usher in female athletics on college campuses. The Voting Rights Act innovated provisions that increased poll access to Latino citizens. King\u2019s example has inspired freedom struggles on several continents. Trump: Frederick Douglass 'is being recognized more and more' And perhaps most importantly, black history is alive. That is to say, from Barack Obama\u2019s historic election to the galvanizing presence of Black Lives Matter demonstrations, the events, social movements, political breakthroughs and human drama that make up Black History Month continue. Trump\u2019s comments on Douglass aren\u2019t the only evidence of a need for more and better black history at the White House. Reading from prepared remarks, Trump once again used the term \u201cthe African-Americans,\u201d keeping up with his (perhaps subconscious) verbal tic of characterizing blacks as an alien other, separate and apart from conventional (read white) American society. Turning to his former campaign rival and recently confirmed HUD secretary Ben Carson, Trump praised the smattering of blacks he met on the campaign as \u201cincredible people.\u201d After praising Martin Luther King Jr., Trump\u2019s comments took a turn for the worse as the President lingered on erroneous reports that he had removed a bust of King from the Oval Office. Although the report was quickly corrected, Trump characterized it as \u201cfake news\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d After citing a list of black leaders, including Rosa Parks, Douglass and King, who did \u201can amazing job\u201d promoting racial justice, Trump praised the group of black conservatives in attendance, while failing to mention that such supporters represent only 8% of the black electorate. The entire scene could have been mistaken for an updated episode of \u201cThe Twilight Zone,\u201d because it shamefully distorted Trump\u2019s actual relationship with the larger African-American community. The pied-piper of racial animus, mistrust and division pronounced himself a champion of Black History Month before a handpicked group of black supporters, journalists and photographers. President Trump's dangerous war on the media Trump\u2019s puerile efforts to endorse a minstrel show version of black history turns our unfolding national racial tragedy into a reality TV show farce, co-starring Dr. Ben Carson as the unfortunate stand-in for every hapless sidekick in Western history whose grinning posture hides unspeakable amounts of pain and humiliation. The man who smeared the first black president with the birther lie, surrounded by conservative black supporters expounding on the importance of black history, makes for a new kind of racial vertigo.  When Teddy Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington into the White House, he didn\u2019t pose for photo ops as Trump did with his band of racial conservatives, a mix of faith leaders, military veterans, and radio and television personalities. Nor would Lyndon Johnson have threatened King with federal intervention to halt violence in Chicago, a statement Trump reiterated at the breakfast. The \u201camazing\u201d civil rights heroes Trump mentioned during his \u201clittle breakfast\u201d would have unequivocally protested his White House\u2019s draconian views on racial justice, especially King. King spoke of the \u201cfierce urgency of now\u201d in opposing war, materialism and racism. More fundamentally, Black History Month (and black history more generally) is about more than just \u201camazing\u201d people from the past or political messaging. Black history represents how everyday and heroic experiences, achievements, successes and failures of African-Americans shape our country\u2019s story.  Trump\u2019s political vision for America \u2013 supported by a White House Cabinet populated overwhelmingly by white men who support policy, legislative and legal views that are hostile to the idea of African-American citizenship and racial equality \u2013 denies this reality, focusing instead on the supposedly pathological behavior of black communities. Black History Month offers a different vision, one President Trump and our country both desperately need to see right now.",

Shana Bernstein: Past abuses of civil liberties yield insight to present-day threats Nearly 1,800 historians and scholars, she writes, are calling for 'informed citizenship' This weekend, I traveled from Chicago to Washington for the Women\u2019s March. Surrounded by hundreds of thousands of women and men, young and old, black and white, in wheelchairs and walking, I was inspired to see how many of us feel the need right now to stand up for our own rights and for those of our fellow Americans from every background. From the plane from Chicago to DC (filled with pink hats), to Metro lines snaking around the corner, to being jam packed on the National Mall, the march and its scope uplifted me for the first time in over two months as I realized how many of my fellow Americans believe we must act as citizens to protect our rights. Some argue that such a protest is partisan and unfair, since Donald Trump has just taken office. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest the marchers are right to be concerned. This month, Human Rights Watch issued a report that, for the first time in its twenty-seven year history, listed the United States as one of the biggest human rights threats because of the election of Donald Trump. Human Rights Watch published its report in the same week that Congress vetted Jeff Sessions as Attorney General in the face of historic opposition from civil rights groups like the NAACP and ACLU. As a historian, I\u2019m in a unique position to spotlight threats \u2013 past and present \u2013 to our civil liberties. The march, the inauguration, and the Human Rights Watch report coincide with the thirtieth anniversary this month of the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 introduction of legislation that became the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, Congress\u2019s apology on behalf of the nation for the World War II imprisonment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent. And that provides an important opportunity to pause and reflect. On January 6, 1987, Congressman Tom Foley of Washington introduced legislation that would acknowledge the internment of citizens and foreigners alike under the guise of military necessity as a mistake, a \u201cgrave injustice\u201d fueled by racism. In its final form, the bill signed into law by President Ronald Reagan stated, \u201cThe internment of the individuals of Japanese ancestry was caused by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\u201d Our present shows us that we can\u2019t afford to forget the past. The Southern Poverty Law Center continues to report the occurrence of significant spikes in hate crimes apparently spurred by the election. Notably, some of the President-elect\u2019s advisors have justified suggestions for a Muslim registry by citing Japanese-American imprisonment during World War II as a credible precedent. Can women's march make magic moment into a movement? Along with two colleagues, I recently organized a statement of principle, now signed by almost 1,800 scholars of U.S. history and related fields with a variety of political orientations, including at least six Pulitzer Prize winners, a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d award recipient, five Bancroft Prize winners, twelve Guggenheim Fellows, and many other highly distinguished and eminent scholars from across the country and internationally. It suggests we must use historical knowledge \u2014 like the content of the 1988 Civil Liberties Act and its acknowledgment of our nation\u2019s past missteps \u2014 as part of what we call \u201cinformed citizenship.\u201d Looking back to history provides copious lessons on what is at stake when we allow hysteria and untruths to trample people\u2019s rights. A key lesson has been to never again repeat these mistakes, and so we issue a call to recognize and act upon the critical links between historical knowledge, informed citizenship, and the protection of civil and human rights. To be sure, some suggest that historians should remain impartial, and that by issuing a collective statement we are being partisan or merely reflecting the so-called \u201cliberal bias\u201d of academia. But this is neither a partisan issue nor a liberal issue. It is an American issue. Obama administration ending program once used to track mostly Arab and Muslim men Informed citizenry is essential to democracy, as the creators of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 recognized when they enshrined in the document the words \u201cWisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of the people\u201d are \u201cnecessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties.\u201d The burden of ensuring our democracy is just lies with the citizens, and I urge my fellow Americans to become informed and help sustain our democracy by, for example, paying attention to history and current politics, committing to get the facts right, and voicing concerns about violations of civil rights and liberties (and other dangers to democracy) to elected officials. In our statement we highlight other historical persecutions, events that show how easily the rights of people have been suspended during times of great uncertainty, and reveal how critical \u201cinformed citizenship\u201d is to the preservation of American democratic ideals. Along with internment, we point to the \u201cwitch hunts\u201d of the early Cold War era, when House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigations of communists and their sympathizers destroyed the lives of countless teachers, artists, politicians, writers, and others. The witch hunts associated with Joseph McCarthy were roundly denounced by Republicans and Democrats during the 1954 Army-McCarthy Senate hearings. Decades of research, debate, and analysis have brought historians to a consensus that episodes like internment and McCarthyism were misguided and immoral. Dear Team Trump,'alternative facts' are lies The nuanced political history of both internment and McCarthyism demonstrate that both major parties have stood at times on the right side of history and also at times have violated democratic ideals. Republicans and Democrats joined in the 1954 Army-McCarthy Senate hearings in denouncing the Republican McCarthy, as they did in supporting the 1988 Civil Liberties Act. Ronald Reagan, a hero of the Republican Party, signed the 1988 Act. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the Democrats\u2019 most revered figures, signed the order for internment. The very same Earl Warren who became liberals\u2019 hero when he led his colleagues as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court in decisions like the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education originally helped orchestrate internment as California\u2019s World War II-era Attorney General. Other scholars and I now join the Republican and Democratic politicians who denounced such policies in earlier eras, as well as the millions of marchers standing up for the rights of all Americans, and repudiate in the strongest possible terms any future policies that foster a return to the (unconstitutional) intolerance and inhumanity of these past episodes. It is deeply disturbing to find ourselves at a historical moment where misguided appeals to hate and fear seem to be regaining traction. Our president boldly disregards factual information, and his spokesperson Kellyanne Conway suggests that \u201calternative facts\u201d are just as real as actual facts, and in the process dismisses the historical lessons that may be drawn when politicians replace fact with exaggeration \u2014 or worse, outright fiction.  I take comfort from and add my voice to those who have recently reminded us as a society to relearn the lessons of history and apply its tools of critical thinking to our current moment. I implore my fellow Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Party, and Independents \u2014 to become informed citizens, to read history with critical and appreciative minds, and to be prepared to fight any attempts to undermine our democracy.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Marc H. Morial is President and CEO of the National Urban League. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Marc H. Morial: Donald Trump has an opportunity to be a leader for all Americans, not just white Americans Morial: The National Urban League and the social justice community will support Trump in expanding, protecting the rights of people of color But leaders will also stand in opposition to any attempts to roll back 50 years of progress on civil rights In the days and weeks following the 2016 presidential election, a wave of racially motivated hate crimes and harassment swept the nation. Many of the perpetrators invoked the name of Donald Trump, suggesting that a new ethos had descended upon the United States. Of all the dangers and uncertainties represented by the incoming administration, the assumption of a fundamental ethical change is potentially the most destructive. We are not a different country just because we have a different president. Our principles of inclusiveness, respect for diversity and opportunity for all citizens haven\u2019t changed. Our core values can and should remain the same. President Donald Trump has an opportunity to prove to the perpetrators of hate crimes and harassment who invoke his name that they are mistaken. He has an opportunity to state repeatedly and unequivocally that this is not what his administration represents. Most importantly, he has an opportunity to show us in the actions he takes and the policies he advocates for that he truly is a leader for all Americans, not just white ones. As the president and CEO of the National Urban League, one of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest racial justice and economic empowerment organizations, this is my fervent hope. At a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina, in October, Trump said, \u201cEvery African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.\u201d And we are, of course. We plan to hold Trump to his word and stand ready to facilitate, however we can, a Trump administration that puts the jobs, wages and security \u2013 not only of African-Americans, but all people of color \u2013 first. Dear Mr. President: We're going to fight back Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary. We would support such a bill, if and only if, it contained a strong jobs-building component that guaranteed employment for workers in neighborhoods with high unemployment rates and minority business participation. That said, Congress has not always been welcoming to infrastructure initiatives \u2013 particularly under President Obama. Obstructionists blocked his $50 billion \u201croads, rails and runways\u201d proposal in 2010 and his American Jobs Act in 2011. They blocked his proposals for an infrastructure bank, a national high-speed rail network and the GROW AMERICA Act (Generating Renewal, Opportunity, and Work with Accelerated Mobility, Efficiency and Rebuilding of Infrastructure and Communities throughout America).  Even if partisan loyalty can overcome some of the hurdles to infrastructure bills, there are still doubts about Trump\u2019s commitment to African-American \u201cjobs, wages and security.\u201d Many of his statements and actions throughout the campaign and transition have been deeply troubling. He has nominated for attorney general Sen. Jeff Sessions, a former federal prosecutor with a history of hostility to racial justice and voting rights. His secretary of education nominee supports policies that drain resources from public schools and into private and for-profit institutions. His nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development disparaged the Fair Housing Act. And Trump himself has never apologized for his real estate company\u2019s history of racial discrimination, nor his campaign to execute five teenagers of color who were later exonerated.  Where we and the rest of the civil rights and social justice community can find common ground with the incoming administration, we will offer support, but we stand firm against any attempts to roll back 50 years of progress on voting rights, economic progress, educational achievement and housing discrimination. As thousands of us chanted as we marched last weekend in Washington, DC: We shall not be moved. We will speak out. We will urge our representatives in Congress to block regressive policies. We will continue to mobilize communities to exercise their legal rights \u2013 at the ballot box, at school, in their workplaces and financial institutions and in the communities where they live.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Peniel Joseph: It's no accident that Trump went after Lewis on the eve of MLK Jr. Day Every president (until now) has taken racial justice as good for the republic, he writes This year\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the last that will be commemorated during the Obama presidency, offers the opportunity for sober clarity about the present leavened by defiant hope for the future.  The King holiday, a hard-won victory by veterans of the civil rights era alongside of black elected officials, became a crucial part of a new national consensus on racial equality. Dr. King\u2019s complex iconography can be understood with a simple lesson: He brought racial justice into the mainstream as a fundamental element of American democracy. On this score, King served as the civil rights movement\u2019s most important political mobilizer, a global Nobel Peace Prize-winning figure capable of bridging racial and economic divides by participating in bus boycotts in Montgomery, Alabama, writing a passionate letter from a Birmingham jail cell, leading a March on Washington, and traversing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a demonstration that galvanized world opinion in support of the struggle for black dignity. In the shadow of continued moments of racial strife, the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday represents America\u2019s political and rhetorical acceptance of civil rights as a moral and political good. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s recent assaults on civil rights icon and Georgia Congressman John L. Lewis, however, signal the potential end of this consensus, diminishing our nation\u2019s moral stature on race matters at the precise moment we need it most. Lewis is a genuine American hero, a humble and courageous foot soldier and civil rights leader, who suffered severe beatings in 1961 as a Freedom Rider and four years later during the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march in Selma, Alabama. He is the last major speaker from the 1963 March on Washington living in America. McDonough: Obama sees Trump as 'freely elected,' defends Lewis But this legacy was not enough to insulate him from the President-elect\u2019s political wrath. After Lewis explained on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he did not consider Trump to be a legitimate president elect because of Russian interference in American elections, the soon-to-be occupant of the Oval Office pounced. Trump launched into a racially charged smearing of the congressman\u2019s Atlanta district as being in \u201chorrible shape\u201d and \u201ccrime infested.\u201d That he engaged in this latest Twitter war a few days before the King holiday is no accident. Throughout perhaps the most racially divisive presidential election campaign in history Trump used terms like \u201cChicago\u201d to signal his open disdain for black America. His comments on \u201cinner cities\u201d revealed a man stuck in a time warp, a place where African Americans all reside in seething urban ghettoes whose potential for violence threatens to wreak havoc on law-abiding white citizens. Almost as in response to Trump\u2019s racially charged fantasies of black lawlessness, poverty, and violence, Attorney General Loretta Lynch reiterated the federal government\u2019s need to \u201cdefend the constitutional rights of the citizens in this great country\u201d by holding law enforcement accountable when they violate their sworn duties to serve and protect. Conservative pundit says Lewis' questioning of Trump 'unprecedented' Just as it is no coincidence that Trump is targeting Lewis as we prepare to mark a day remembering Martin Luther King, it is not accidental that Lynch will deliver her final speech as attorney general in Birmingham, a major site not only in King\u2019s life but also in the civil rights movement writ large \u2013 and located in a state that is home to her successor. Trump and his nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, represent the post-consensus face of American politics on racial justice.  By normalizing the demonization of predominantly black neighborhoods across the nation as unworthy of federal protection and resources, Trump signals to both ordinary citizens and political institutions the value that should be placed on the black folk who live there. Sessions, meanwhile, has adopted less combative rhetoric but has called the Voting Rights Act \u201cintrusive,\u201d prosecuted civil rights activists for voter fraud and expressed support for voter ID laws. 2017 promises to offer a racial landscape at the federal level that echoes aspects of King\u2019s era more than our recent past, where President Obama\u2019s rise gave way to grand expectations that the nation had finally turned the corner on race. How to honor MLK legacy in Whitefish, Montana Yet one of King\u2019s most important legacies, though less talked about, is the embrace of defiant struggle against long odds. During the last three years of his life, King fought hard for economic justice in Chicago, spoke out against the Vietnam War, organized alongside welfare rights activists and attempted to lead a poor people\u2019s movement whose multi-racial makeup formed one strand of a global community that King characterized as the \u201cworld house.\u201d King\u2019s willingness to speak truth to power helped to transform American democracy, expanding the vision of the Founding Fathers into one that included a larger cast of characters than they could have ever conceived. What he characterized as \u201cgreat wells of democracy\u201d became a metaphor for a panoramic movement for social justice that reshaped every corner of American society and inspired Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to make the cause their own. Indeed, every president since then, despite disagreements over how best to achieve racial equality, has accepted this goal as an article of faith. Until now. Yet the genius of King and the larger civil rights movement is in unleashing the power of ideas that transcend political leaders, democratic institutions, even nation-states. King faced obstacles larger and more enduring than presidents or election cycles, yet he never lost faith in the capacity for citizens to recognize their own humanity in the lives of others and to use this knowledge and empathy to transform the world. \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long,\u201d King reminded the nation, \u201cbut it bends toward justice.\u201d  Permanent change required, he argued, a \u201crevolution of values\u201d that included but also transcended policy changes, legal victories and legislative breakthroughs. The power of King\u2019s message in these times is reminding the world that justice is what love looks like in public, even when new leaders emerge willfully bent on forgetting.",

Mark Bauerlein says his campus colleagues view President-elect Donald Trump with dread Trump can do a lot to de-emphasize the role of identity politics in higher education, Bauerlein says As day follows day and January 20 approaches, my colleagues and students experience something along the lines of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 60: \u201cLike as the waves make toward the pebbled shore, / So do our minutes hasten to their end.\u201d As far as they\u2019re concerned, the ascent of Donald Trump spells D-O-O-M. It is easy to understand why they believe it.  Professors and administrators at the best universities in the land have gone so deeply into identity politics that they can only regard him as an atavistic clod.  They have raised the ordinary frictions of daily affairs into a melodrama of microaggression, heteronormativity, and ableism, and Trump won\u2019t respect the new rules.  They create safe spaces for all \u2014 my university library brought dogs in before finals so students might drop by, cuddle, and de-stress \u2014 and now every presidential tweet and interview promises to despoil those spaces. Which only proves the necessity of a blunt, outspoken chief executive in America 2017.  These academic grumblings don\u2019t prove the moral scruples of campus dwellers.  They show that something is profoundly wrong with the American college. Hypersensitivity is out of control.  Nobody wants to provoke others, so everyone carries an invisible trigger-meter.  I see it in my students\u2019 eyes when anything about race, sexuality or politics comes up.  A flicker of fear crosses their faces.  You can imagine the silent calculation in their heads that tells them to stay silent. This is a civic plight, and it\u2019s contrary to the wide-open American spirit of free expression and tolerance.  Our national poet Walt Whitman sensed the genius of the nation in the banter and repartee of the working class \u2014 \u201cthe blab of the pave,\u201d he called it \u2014 and it included rough slang and raucous jokes.  He would find the language of higher education today repressed and bureaucratic. The personal bearing of Donald Trump is a direct challenge to this timidity.  He must realize that people flocked to his rallies because there, for an exhilarating hour, they escaped from the pressures of political correctness and white guilt, male guilt, American guilt, and Christian guilt.  The contrast between those rollicking crowds and the dour atmosphere on the quad was stark. President Trump could serve the country well by exploding this climate of caution and hurt.  Recognizing that sensitivity is charted on racial and sexual differences, the new administration should attack school policies that aggravate them. For instance, are colleges practicing preferential admissions that exceed what the Supreme Court allowed in Fisher v. University of Texas?  They should be warned in a so-called \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter \u2014 an official advisory statement from the government \u2014 that sharpens the line between legal and illegal decision-making. University stands by 'Problem of Whiteness' course And are colleges designing biased proceedings with low standards of due process when they handle allegations of harassment and assault?  Another Dear Colleague letter should restore the burden of proof to \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d not preponderance of evidence (which is what the Obama administration lowered it to). These actions would tell colleges they must draw down on racial and sexual testiness, along with the offense-taking that follows from them.  Administrators would get the message that if they ask students to distinguish more clearly genuine cases of harassment from the occasional annoying, offensive acts that pop up in every free society, the federal government won\u2019t rebuke them. Also, there is an educational policy the Trump administration could set that would lower sensitivities and raise academic standards, too.  In September 2015, the Obama administration unveiled the College Scorecard, an online tool containing data on thousands of higher ed institutions.  The scorecard profiles schools on numerous points including cost, retention rate, student body demographics and available areas of study. But the essential duty of college is missing: how much students learn from matriculation to graduation.   It should be included, and here\u2019s how: The Trump Department of Education can insert into the scorecard results taken from a test of thinking and communication skills called the Collegiate Learning Assessment. Currently at more than 700 institutions, students sit for the test at the beginning and the end of their undergraduate careers.  Comparing those scores, college leaders measure the \u201cvalue-added\u201d impact of their schools.  At some places, growth in critical thinking, analytical reasoning and problem solving is high, at others almost nonexistent. With this academic variable placed alongside financial and demographic information in the College Scorecard, colleges will be encouraged to create a campus more open to debate, free speech, ideological diversity, and the inevitable irritations of an open society.  Sensitivity does the opposite.  It\u2019s anti-intellectual.  People who constantly have their radar attuned to slights don\u2019t fare well on critical thinking, but youths learning in rousingly diverse environments do.  With the federal government broadcasting those outcomes, more schools will prize a boisterous intellectual forensic and reduce the emotionalism. Colleges compete with one another strenuously, and we can be sure that if Vanderbilt students show more academic growth than Emory\u2019s do, Vandy will spread the news and Emory will strive to catch up. The election of Donald Trump is a stinging reversal of the identity politics that academics believed had become a permanent and proper feature of the United States.  It is one reason he won.  He should direct that plank straight at the sphere in which identity-sensitivity has been indulged and amplified into the quite illiberal persuasion that it now is.",

            "article_content": "White nationalist Richard Spencer will speak at the University of Florida on Thursday The school has increased security ahead of expected protests Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for Alachua County on Monday ahead of expected protests around a speech by prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer at the University of Florida. Spencer, the president of the white nationalist group National Policy Institute, is expected to deliver his views on Thursday afternoon at the university, and officials are wary that the incident could turn violent. Spencer said in a phone interview with CNN that he was \u201cflattered\u201d by the state of emergency declaration. \u201cI\u2019m up there with hurricanes and invading armies and zombie apocalypses,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best way to look at it.\u201d But he added that he thought the declaration was \u201coverkill\u201d and worried it would be used to shut down the event. \u201cThe fact is, if the police simply do their job, my speech and the whole event will go off wonderfully,\u201d he said. Previous speeches from Spencer on college campuses have sparked protests, including at Auburn University in April and Texas A&M in December. He also led a group of supporters carrying torches in May in Charlottesville, Virginia, in a display that critics said evoked images of the Ku Klux Klan. The display preceded the violent protests in August in Charlottesville, during which a car slammed into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman. The driver was arrested and faces second-degree murder charges. War on campus: The escalating battle over college free speech Spencer said Tuesday that the protests at Auburn and Texas A&M were limited to \u201csome mild violence\u201d because police did their jobs. He said the state of emergency declaration in Florida might be used as a justification to cancel his speech, as happened in Charlottesville in August. \u201cI don\u2019t think Florida is going to become Charlottesville in the sense that chaos will ensue, but there is a small possibility they might use this state of emergency as justification to end the event,\u201d he said. Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell requested the emergency declaration, she said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate Governor Scott\u2019s support and continued concern to the citizens of Alachua County and the State of Florida,\u201d Sheriff Darnell said. \u201cTogether with our federal, state and local authorities we have developed a comprehensive safety and security plan for the speaking event.\u201d \u201cWe live in a country where everyone has the right to voice their opinion, however, we have zero tolerance for violence and public safety is always our number one priority,\u201d Scott said in a press release. Spencer is a leader of the growing white nationalist movement in the US and identifies as being part of the \u201calt-right.\u201d He has criticized diversity and inclusion as \u201cword salad gobbledy-gook,\u201d and often speaks about the need for a white \u201cawakening\u201d in the US. Janine Sikes, assistant vice president of public affairs at the university, said in a statement that the state of emergency declaration was \u201cnot in response to any specific heightened threat.\u201d \u201cIt is a process that enables various law enforcement agencies to work together more efficiently. For example, agencies from multiple jurisdictions can be mobilized, if necessary, without bureaucratic delays,\u201d Sikes said. \u201cWe appreciate Gov. Scott\u2019s support and commitment to UF\u2019s campus safety.\u201d Florida has most recently declared states of emergency for the hurricanes that have rocked the state in recent weeks. On Twitter, Spencer posted an image of his head over a map of a hurricane nearing Florida, saying that \u201cHurricane Ricardo\u201d was expected to hit Gainesville. BREAKING: Hurricane Ricardo expected to hit Gainsville this Thursday. pic.twitter.com/85eDCcnvdZ Spencer may be best known for a controversial speech last November in which he mixed his white nationalist views with praise of Donald Trump\u2019s election win. \u201cAmerica was, until this last generation, a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity. It is our creation and our inheritance, and it belongs to us,\u201d he said. \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\u201d Spencer said, as those in the crowd gave Nazi salutes, according to video from The Atlantic magazine. In addition, Spencer said he wanted to \u201cmake white privilege great again\u201d in an interview with CNN\u2019s W. Kamau Bell. \u201cWe bring a level of civilization. We\u2019re more interested in power. We\u2019re more interested in exploration and domination. I just want to bathe in white privilege,\u201d he said. Spencer\u2019s planned visit has caused repeated headaches for University of Florida administrators. Spencer and the National Policy Institute first requested to rent speaking space at UF in August. After violent white nationalist protests broke out in Charlottesville, the UF administration denied the National Policy Institute\u2019s initial speaking request, citing specific threats of violence. White supremacist Richard Spencer denied at University of Florida But as a state entity, UF is required by law to uphold the First Amendment rights that forbid state discrimination based on the content or views of a speech. The event is unaffiliated with the school, and no student groups sponsored the speech or invited him, the university said. By law, the school must pay for the costs of security. However, given the heightened concerns, the school is providing extra security which exceeds $500,000, according to University of Florida President Kent Fuchs. The university provided a permit for Spencer to speak, though Fuchs clarified that he strongly disagreed with Spencer\u2019s views. \u201cUF has been clear and consistent in its denunciation of all hate speech and racism, and in particular the racist speech and white-nationalist values of Mr. Spencer,\u201d Fuchs said in a statement. \u201cI personally find the doctrine of white supremacy abhorrent and denounce all forms of racism and hate.\u201d In the statement, Fuchs asked the community not to give Spencer and his followers the spotlight, yet also urged people to \u201cspeak up for your values.\u201d \u201cMr. Spencer\u2019s message is disproportionately hurtful to members of our Gator community who are targets of hate and violence simply because of their skin color, religion, culture, sexual orientation or beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cThose of us in the majority must speak up for those in the minority and make our voice of love and support heard.\u201d The university set up an entire webpage dedicated to questions about the event, which includes details on the plans for heightened security. Several buildings and classrooms near the speech will be closed Thursday, and Gainesville Police have announced road closures that day. CNN\u2019s Holly Yan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "If in 2012 a stranger tapped you on the shoulder, leaned in and whispered: \u201cDonald Trump will be the president of the United States in 2017 and also The New York Times, on a random Saturday in December, will publish a convincing report on the existence of aliens in our midst,\u201d you\u2019d have wheeled away and laughed. President Donald Trump? OK, pal. As it turns out, both things are true. Trump is definitely coming up on his first anniversary in office and the aliens are, if not currently levitating outside your window, apparently zipping around in (or controlling) UFOs, freaking out naval pilots, all as mysterious \u201cmetal alloys\u201d sit in a storage space somewhere in Nevada. Relive Trump's first year in two minutes The first year of the Trump era has turned American life utterly sideways. It has also \u2013 and here\u2019s where the aliens come in \u2013 scrambled our collective sense of what\u2019s truly sensational. As such, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that word of a shadowy Pentagon UFO study program has been met mostly with \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afs, and a few entertaining freakouts over all the  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afs. Real life is stranger than science fiction (or nonfiction) these days, and here, below, is part of the reason why \u2013 a dozen or so things your pre-2017 self would\u2019ve found more surprising, or confusing or plain ridiculous, than news of some modest intergalactic tourism. \u201cBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d One of the former presidents in attendance, George W. Bush, reportedly offered a brief but memorable review. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwas some weird s\u2013t.\u201d Said Sean Spicer, in a very loud voice, of the previous day\u2019s festivities: \u201cThat was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. Spicer, who so memorably \u201chuddled with his staff among bushes near television sets on the White House grounds\u201d in order to avoid walking past reporters en route to his office on the night Trump fired FBI director James Comey, would leave his job in July. But not before suggesting, in April, that Hitler never used \u201cgas on his own people.\u201d (A digression for which he later apologized.) \u201cWe had finished dinner,\u201d Trump recalled to Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \u201cWe\u2019re now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you\u2019ve ever seen and (Chinese) President Xi was enjoying it.\u201d That\u2019s when, as the President told it, he informed Xi Jinping of his decision to launch an attack on Syria. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. President, let me explain something to you\u2019 \u2013 this was during dessert \u2013 \u2018we\u2019ve just fired 59 missiles,\u2019 all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing.\u201d One snag. Trump, during the interview, misplaced the target. \u201cSo, what happens is I said, \u2018We\u2019ve just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq \u2013 \u201c Bartiromo interjected here to ask: \u201cHeading to Syria?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHeading toward Syria.\u201d There was a time before this expression existed. It ended on January 22, 2017. The third day of Trump\u2019s presidency. Not two weeks later, Conway offered some truly \u201cbrand new information\u201d to support and defend Trump\u2019s travel ban. Here\u2019s what she told MSNBC: \u201cI bet it\u2019s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn\u2019t get covered.\u201d That last line is right, up to a point. There was no \u201cmassacre,\u201d so no massacre was covered. The story she claimed to be referencing was, in fact, reported on. As she confirmed in a tweet linking to an ABC News report on it. On @hardball @NBCNews @MSNBC I meant to say  \"Bowling Green terrorists\" as reported here: https://t.co/nB5SwIEoYI Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! In March, Trump accused his predecessor of tapping his phones during the election. Having no proof, he offered none. After about 10 days of saying he wouldn\u2019t comment on the tweet, then commenting, then not commenting some more, Spicer asked that Trump not be taken literally. \u201cThe president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities during that,\u201d he said. Let\u2019s try to get this over with in one sentence: Trump fired his FBI director after asking him to ease up on his national security adviser, who\u2019s since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, leading the deputy attorney general (who made the decision because the attorney general recused himself after failing to disclose Russian contacts during his confirmation hearings) to appoint a special counsel, himself a former FBI director, to probe the Trump campaign\u2019s potential ties to Russia, a decision that\u2019s led to multiple indictments and guilty pleas from people in Trump\u2019s inner circle, a number of whom are or might now be cooperating with prosecutors, a development that kicked off a seemingly coordinated effort among Trump\u2019s allies, most notably his friends at Fox News, to discredit the special counsel amid speculation Trump will try to fire him. It was worth a try. (If you want more, here\u2019s a comprehensive tracker.) Last December, about a month after the election, a guy named Eric Garland began a 127-tweet thread with the since meme-ified introduction: \u201cGuys. It\u2019s time for some game theory.\u201d There followed an inane and rambling disquisition on how Russia installed Trump as president. <THREAD> I\u2019m now hearing this meme that says Obama, Clinton, et al. are doing nothing, just gave up.Guys. It\u2019s time for some game theory. Since then, liberal Russia conspiracy Twitter, though mostly (and understandably) a secondary concern to the Alt-right on social media, has become a sort of cottage industry for anti-Trump folks who believe a more satisfying truth is out there. It\u2019d be funny, and inconsequential, if so many otherwise well-meaning people didn\u2019t parrot their baseless talking points. Alas, they do, and in so doing further cloud our already unstable reality. The fever has mellowed a bit over the course of the year. Among the wake-up calls was this hilariously deluded blog post from former British MP Louise Mensch, who has made herself over as an investigative journalist, and Claude Taylor, a former (very) low level staffer in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House whose twitter handle is, no joke, @TrueFactsStated: ah, another hot scoop rooted in finely granular knowledge of how the U.S. government does not operate pic.twitter.com/1hO3bAARSc Next time you see a reference to the \u201cmarshal of the Supreme Court,\u201d you\u2019ll know why. In September, the White House special counsel, a man named Ty Cobb, broadcast the inner workings of Trump\u2019s Russia strategy during a boisterous outdoor lunch with a colleague. Because they were seated at a popular Washington steakhouse, close to both the White House and The New York Times\u2019 DC bureau, a Times reporter heard it all. Here. Look: Here's a photo of Ty Cobb & John Dowd casually & loudly discussing details of Russia investigation at @BLTSteakDC while I sat at next table. pic.twitter.com/RfX9JLJ0Te Among the words spoken\u2026 Vice President Mike Pence: \u201cGreatest privilege of my life to serve as your vice president.\u201d Chief of Staff Reince Priebus: \u201cOn behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you\u2019ve given us to serve your agenda and the American people.\u201d (Priebus would be fired in July.) Attorney General Jeff Sessions: \u201cWe are receiving, as you know \u2013 I\u2019m not sure the rest of you fully understand \u2013 the support of law enforcement all over America.\u201d Energy Secretary Rick Perry: \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to you for taking that stand (on the Paris climate deal), for sending a clear message around the world that America is gonna continue to lead in the area of energy.\u201d UN envoy Nikki Haley: \u201cIt\u2019s a new day at the United Nations. We now have a very strong voice. People know what the US is for, they know what we\u2019re against and they see us leading across the board.\u201d White House budget director Mick Mulvaney: \u201cWith your direction we were able to also focus on the forgotten man and woman who are the folks who are paying those taxes, so I appreciate your support and your direction in pulling that budget together.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price: \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for the privilege that you\u2019ve given me and the leadership that you\u2019ve shown.\u201d (Price would be forced out after amid a scandal over his use of private jets.) Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue: \u201cI want to congratulate you on the men and women you\u2019ve placed around this table. The holistic team of working for America is making results in each and every area.\u201d That was in a tweet, from November 11. Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me \"old,\" when I would NEVER call him \"short and fat?\" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! Back in September, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea and gave Kim a new nickname. Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer! Like a vice principal delivering the morning announcements, an uncharacteristically rote-sounding Trump made this proclamation over Twitter on a Wednesday morning in late July: After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... ....Transgender individuals to  serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..... ....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you Fast-forward a few months and the Pentagon has said it will begin processing transgender military applicants on January 1. This after a federal judge declined earlier this month to put the deadline on hold. LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He\u2019s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military. VOTE ROY MOORE! Trump backed Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in Alabama\u2019s special Senate election, after Moore was accused of molestation, sexual assault and trying to date teenagers decades ago, when he was in his 30s. Moore lost the race. (More than a week after the vote, he has yet to concede.) In her first solo briefing after taking over the job, Sanders read a letter, addressed to Trump, from a young child. She even answered his questions. Thank you Dylan (aka Pickle) for your letter to @POTUS! We hope to meet you soon! pic.twitter.com/RtTb6KtsZN Naturally, there was some skepticism. But a subsequent Washington Post investigation confirmed that, yes, \u201cPickle\u201d was a real boy. After hemming and hawing for a couple of days, Trump denounced the white supremacists responsible for kicking off deadly violence in Virginia. Then he told us what he really thought. In a wild, unplanned back-and-forth with reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, the President became increasingly defensive. \u201cI\u2019ve condemned neo-Nazis. I\u2019ve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also had some very fine people on both sides.\u201d Republican leaders sent out a raft of scolding statements and Trump saw some departures from his private industry working groups, but there was no institutional response. Let\u2019s get meta. Forget the aliens themselves. How about the fact, as noted by CNN\u2019s Steve Brusk, that no one is talking about the aliens. It\u2019s almost as if the country would prefer conspiracy theories to real evidence and now that we seem to have it, people are bored by the whole thing. Forced to choose between Trump and the aliens, Americans went with Trump. CNN\u2019s Brenna Williams contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump privately seems less frustrated about the investigation President tells friends and advisers that he expects Mueller to soon clear him of wrongdoing There's no indication that the probe is in its final stages President Donald Trump is privately striking a less agitated tone on the Russia investigation, sources say, even insisting he\u2019ll soon be cleared in writing. But his new approach has some allies worried he\u2019s not taking the threat of the probe seriously enough. Trump has spent much of his first year in office so enraged by the federal investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election that lawmakers who work with him tried to avoid the issue entirely and his friends worried that Trump might rashly fire the special counsel. But in recent weeks, Trump has privately seemed less frustrated about the investigation, according to multiple sources who have spoken with the President. There\u2019s no indication from special counsel Robert Mueller or his team that the probe is in its final stages. A tipping point in the showdown could come as soon as this week when Trump\u2019s private lawyers and Mueller meet, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump\u2019s team is hoping to get a clearer sense of Mueller\u2019s next steps in the investigation, an assessment that could either pacify Trump or inflame him. Until those next signs emerge, Trump is boasting to friends and advisers that he expects Mueller to clear him of wrongdoing in the coming weeks, according to sources familiar with the conversations. The President seems so convinced of his impending exoneration that he is telling associates Mueller will soon write a letter clearing him that Trump can brandish to Washington and the world in a bid to finally emerge from the cloud of suspicion that has loomed over the first chapter of his presidency, the sources said. This account of how Trump and his senior staffers are privately grappling with the Russia investigation is based on interviews over the past week with nearly three dozen White House officials, lawmakers, outside advisers, friends of the President and sources familiar with the Mueller probe. It depicts a president genuinely convinced of his innocence and advisers preparing for him to explode early next year if the probe doesn\u2019t end as neatly as Trump expects. In private conversations, Trump still speaks dismissively of the Russia investigation, referring to it as \u201cbulls\u2014\u201d and proclaiming \u201cI don\u2019t know any Russians!\u201d multiple sources told CNN. But those outbursts are measured against Trump\u2019s belief that the investigation will soon wrap up favorably. That rosy picture has buoyed Trump\u2019s spirits in recent weeks, leaving him seemingly less frustrated and more even-keeled about the investigation even as Mueller\u2019s team landed a guilty plea and the cooperation of one of the President\u2019s former top advisers, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. \u201cThe President\u2019s mantra is \u2018All this Russia stuff, it\u2019s all going to wrap up soon.\u2019 He repeats it as fact,\u201d said one source who speaks to Trump. \u201cPart of me is like \u2013 \u2018Are you serious? You believe this?\u2019\u201d The President, speaking to reporters at the White House Sunday evening, insisted he wasn\u2019t considering firing Mueller. But the pressure on Mueller from Trump\u2019s allies is growing. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get past this investigation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a giant distraction,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has said that, in any way, this impacted the outcome of the election.\u201d Meanwhile, lawyers representing the Trump presidential transition wrote to members of Congress accusing Mueller of obtaining unauthorized access to tens of thousands of transition emails, including what they claim to be documents protected by attorney-client privilege. Mueller\u2019s spokesman responded that, \u201cWhen we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing investigation, we have secured either the account owner\u2019s consent or appropriate criminal process.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team has told the President he will likely be cleared of wrongdoing in the coming months, according to a senior White House official and sources who have spoken with Trump. That optimism has left some of the President\u2019s friends and advisers worried the deadline could come and go, leaving Trump frustrated and more prone to rash behavior than ever before, including potentially firing Mueller. A number of Trump\u2019s allies have warned him that any attempt to fire Mueller could be a fatal blow to his presidency. Three sources familiar with the President\u2019s recent conversations about the investigation said Trump has become convinced that he will receive a letter of exoneration, which would be unusual. One source worried Trump would have a \u201cmeltdown\u201d if that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cHe\u2019ll try and fire Mueller and then be impeached,\u201d this person predicted. White House special counsel Ty Cobb and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, are trying to prevent Trump from lashing out over the investigation, said a source who speaks with the President. \u201cWhat they are trying to do is manage Trump. That\u2019s what everyone tries to do.\u201d But a longtime friend of the President\u2019s said he believes Trump\u2019s attorneys have \u201clulled him into a false sense of security\u201d \u2013 which could be a dangerous game. \u201cI\u2019ve known him long enough to know that disappointing him is a problem and they\u2019ve built up a level of expectations for him that are unrealistic,\u201d the Trump friend said. The assessment by the President\u2019s lawyers cuts against the grain of legal experts who believe the Mueller investigation is only ramping up, with Flynn\u2019s guilty plea and his agreement to cooperate with investigators signaling that Mueller is chasing even bigger fish. Lawyers for others involved in the investigation are also skeptical that Mueller is close to wrapping up his work. Cobb insists the investigation is winding down and has said he expects the part of the probe that is scrutinizing the President and the White House will come to a close early next year. \u201cThe special counsel has had the White House documents for some time now and has concluded all requested White House interviews. The President is confident based on the lack of evidence of any wrongdoing that he\u2019ll be treated appropriately by the special counsel and ideally in the near future,\u201d Cobb told CNN Sunday, though he acknowledged Mueller could request additional interviews with White House staff. Cobb declined to speculate on how the President would be publicly exonerated. He said he and the President had never discussed a letter of exoneration and said he had \u201cno idea\u201d where Trump got the idea. Privately, Cobb has sought to assuage Trump and White House staffers by touting his connections to Mueller and members of his team, whom he has known in Washington for years, sources familiar with the matter said. He also cites his familiarity with the thousands of documents the White House has provided to Mueller\u2019s investigators, the sources said. But Cobb\u2019s timeline predicting the end of Mueller\u2019s focus on the White House has repeatedly shifted. First, he said the investigation would end by Thanksgiving. Then, he said it would wrap up by the end of the year. Now, he\u2019s predicting early next year. Mark Corallo, a former spokesman for the President\u2019s legal team, said he doubts Mueller would deliver a letter exonerating Trump before he has fully wrapped up his investigation. But he said pressure is mounting for Mueller to conclude his investigation as a result of reports that several members of his investigative team (who have since been taken off the investigation) have privately expressed anti-Trump sentiments. \u201cIf you\u2019re Mueller and you want to have any shred of credibility, you have to find a way\u201d to bring the investigation to a close, Corallo said. \u201cIf you reach the conclusion that the President of the United States doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this\u2026he\u2019s going to have to find some way to make that public. We\u2019re at that point now.\u201d One senior White House official insisted that even if Cobb\u2019s timeline doesn\u2019t pan out, he has provided the necessary reassurance of a \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d in a White House where the investigation sometimes seems to loom endlessly and where the President\u2019s mood has been affected by its topsy-turvy nature. \u201cIf it\u2019s not totally on that timeline, do I think there\u2019s going to be a problem? No. I think that people are realistic that things change, stuff happens,\u201d the senior White House official said. \u201cYou cross that bridge when you get to it.\u201d While Cobb\u2019s words have reassured some White House officials who have become wrapped up in the investigation, many staffers continue to work under the assumption that the probe is intensifying, five sources close to the White House said. The Russia investigation has become the backdrop for day-to-day life at the White House. Officials insist it doesn\u2019t disrupt their work days, although the latest Russia developments and the President\u2019s own Twitter musings often send some in the communications shop scrambling to respond. But sources acknowledged the constant clamor of the investigation \u2013 and wall-to-wall media coverage \u2013 has weighed on the mood in the West Wing. \u201cThe commotion around the investigation is morale-crushing to everybody,\u201d said one source familiar with the situation. Senior staffers have borne the brunt of the anxiety. Many have hired lawyers and worked with them at length to prepare for their interviews with the special counsel\u2019s team. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and one of Trump\u2019s closest aides, missed several days of work in order to meet with her lawyer to prepare for her interview, two sources said. \u201cI feel for these White House staffers that are caught up in these interviews because it\u2019s nerve-wracking,\u201d said Scott Jennings, who found himself embroiled in a special counsel investigation during his tenure as deputy director of political affairs under President George W. Bush.  \u201cThe thing that nobody really knows, having really lived through one of these, is just how much of a toll this can take on staff in terms of stress, anxiety, personal legal bills.\u201d For now at least, White House staffers are paying their legal fees out of their own pockets, a significant expense for government employees. One source who has spoken with the President said he seems to be unaware of the anxiety among staffers. \u201cEverybody needs a pat on the back, some reassurances that the President is loyal to them, and he just doesn\u2019t do that well,\u201d the source said. As the investigation creeps toward 2018, White House officials and former campaign aides remain adamant that there was no coordination or collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russian officials. Some White House staffers have taken to dismissing the investigation as \u201cfake news\u201d and using it as grist for gallows humor. \u201cYou getting nervous?\u201d staffers would quip to former Trump campaign hands working in the White House. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the special counsel\u2019s investigation hasn\u2019t been a distraction. \u201cWe have not missed a step, struggled to get our work done or been distracted,\u201d she said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe have been focused on growing the economy, passing massive tax cuts, defeating ISIS, cutting regulations at a record pace and creating millions of jobs.\u201d While Trump may have temporarily adopted a more serene view of the special counsel\u2019s investigation, he remains irritated by the ongoing Russia investigations playing out on Capitol Hill. He has pressed some lawmakers for details about the status of the congressional probes. \u201cWhen you look at the committees, whether it\u2019s the Senate or the House, everybody \u2013 my worst enemies, they walk out, they say, \u2018There is no collusion but we\u2019ll continue to look.\u2019 They\u2019re spending millions and millions of dollars. There\u2019s absolutely no collusion. I didn\u2019t make a phone call to Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. Everybody knows it,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered on the South Lawn of the White House Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to running a country.\u201d Contrary to the President\u2019s claims, the congressional committees have not yet determined whether there is evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. In multiple conversations with Republican senators, Trump expressed frustration about the scope of the investigations, according to two sources familiar with the conversations. Several members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees, which are conducting Russia investigations, have made a conscious effort to avoid Trump and the White House this year to guard against allegations of impropriety. Other lawmakers have taken pains to avoid discussing the issue with the President even as they try to work alongside him to advance the GOP\u2019s agenda. In a private phone call with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in August, soon after the collapse of the health care bill in the Senate, Trump let his frustrations fly \u2013 but not about the failure to repeal Obamacare. He railed against McConnell about the ongoing congressional probes, a call that devolved into the President shouting profanities at the majority leader, sources briefed on the call said. The two men have steered clear of discussing the Russia probe since, sources said. Over several rounds of golf in recent weeks, Sen. Lindsey Graham said he has tried to avoid discussing Russia when he\u2019s on the course with Trump. \u201cWe pretty much don\u2019t talk about Russia a lot,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. \u201cHe sort of knows where I\u2019m at. This investigation is going to go where it goes.\u201d When the topic does come up, Graham said, he gets a familiar refrain from Trump.  \u201cHe complains about it, says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI say, \u2018Alright Mr. President, time will tell.\u2019\u201d Even as the President devours cable news and vents on Twitter, allies inside and outside the White House said Trump\u2019s days aren\u2019t consumed by an obsession with the Russia probe. Perhaps his biggest frustration is that he believes the investigations are hindering his governing prowess. Trump has told one senator repeatedly that the ongoing probes undermine his standing on the world stage and make it harder for him to work with foreign leaders, according to a person with direct knowledge of the calls. If the President is concerned about the uproar over Russia drowning out his agenda now, experts said next year could prove even more painful if Republicans lose control of the House or the Senate. \u201cFrom an investigatory perspective, the paralysis that can be injected by the opposite party controlling Congress is so significant,\u201d said Jennings, drawing on his experience in the Bush administration. \u201cI hope there is an appreciation for the fact that this presidency could come to a complete standstill in less than one year.\u201d While Mueller\u2019s probe has focused on criminal wrongdoing, congressional investigators have much wider latitude. Democrats could try to unearth unsavory stories about abuses of power or efforts to shame public officials. And investigations that Republicans have largely led behind closed doors could be thrust into the public view, an outcome that would almost certainly be more damaging to the President\u2019s approval ratings. \u201cThe most important difference at this point in the story between the Watergate scandal and \u2018Hackergate\u2019 or \u2018Russiagate\u2019 is that Congress is not holding public hearings,\u201d said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian and the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. \u201cIt was every day, it was public and people watched it,\u201d Naftali said of the Watergate scandal. \u201cIt was like a soap opera.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger, Dana Bash, Pamela Brown and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

Doug Jones and his wife, Louise Jones, wave to an audience on election night in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday. Jones became the first Democrat in a generation to win a US Senate seat in Alabama, beating Republican Roy Moore amid of accusations that Moore sexually assaulted or abused teenage girls decades earlier. Republican US Senate candidate Roy Moore waits to take the stage on election night in Montgomery, Alabama, on Tuesday. Moore refused to concede the special election, saying his campaign is waiting for ballots to be certified. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Jones would not be certified as the winner of the election. Federal Communications Commissioner Chairman Ajit Pai takes a sip from a mug during a meeting Thursday in Washington, where the Republican-led panel repealed Obama-era net neutrality protections.

            "article_content": "Condoleezza Rice's statement doesn't cite any candidate by name The race has put a spotlight on a rift in the GOP over the controversial candidate Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is calling on Alabama voters to take part in Tuesday\u2019s special election for the US Senate, dubbing the race \u201cone of the most significant in Alabama\u2019s history,\u201d according to AL.com. \u201cThis week\u2019s special election will be one of the most significant in Alabama\u2019s history. As a native daughter, I remain \u2013 at heart \u2013 an Alabaman who loves our state and its devotion to faith, family, and country,\u201d Rice said in a statement, recalling her Alabama roots. Republican Roy Moore will face off against Democrat Doug Jones in the special election to fill the seat that Republican Jeff Sessions occupied before he left last winter to become US attorney general. The race has put a spotlight on a rift in the GOP over the 70-year-old Moore, a controversial candidate who has recently been accused by multiple women of attempting to engage in sexual relationships with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. He has also been accused of molesting a 14-year-old and sexually assaulting a 16-year-old. Moore has denied any inappropriate behavior. Despite condemnation of Moore from several Republican lawmakers, the White House and the Republican National Committee have put their support behind him. Rice\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t cite any candidate by name but says it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d to \u201cnot give way to side shows and antics,\u201d AL.com reported. \u201cI know that Alabamans need an independent voice in Washington,\u201d the statement on AL.com reads. \u201cBut we must also insist that our representatives are dignified, decent, and respectful of the values we hold dear.\u201d Jones is also known for his role as lead prosecutor in the lawsuit against two of four Ku Klux Klan members who were part of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963, which killed four African-American girls \u2013 who Rice knew as a child in Birmingham, Alabama. \u201cI encourage you to take a stand for our core principles and for what is right,\u201d Rice\u2019s statement continued, as reported on AL.com. \u201cThese critical times require us to come together to reject bigotry, sexism, and intolerance.\u201d AL.com reports that Rice also says, \u201cPlease exercise your right to vote \u2013 a privilege won by the sacrifices of our ancestors. Sustain the central ideals and values that make our country a beacon for freedom and justice for the sake of Alabama and for the good of the United States of America.\u201d CNN\u2019s Caroline Kenny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Don McGahn is expected to be interviewed in the coming weeks He also served as the Trump presidential campaign's chief counsel He'll have choices to make, including what he'll share with investigators One of the next members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to enter the Russia investigation spotlight finds himself in a particularly awkward spot: He\u2019s the top lawyer at the White House. Don McGahn is expected to be interviewed in the coming weeks in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, along with communications director Hope Hicks and Josh Raffel, who handles press-related inquiries for White House senior adviser Jared Kushner. The 49-year-old former Federal Election commissioner acted as a conduit of information to Trump before the President decided to fire National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey. McGahn also served as the Trump presidential campaign\u2019s chief counsel while he was still a partner in private practice at the law firm Jones Day. McGahn\u2019s work on both the Trump campaign and at the center of the West Wing makes him one of the few Trump team insiders who may have knowledge about several threads of the Mueller probe. \u201cThe White House counsel would be in the position to know about the decisions that relate to the investigation,\u201d said Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel during the Obama administration. The top White House lawyer \u201cwould be the person who interfaces with the Justice Department and the person the president would most likely talk to about those issues.\u201d In the coming weeks, McGahn will have choices to make, including what he will share with investigators. For now, White House special counsel Ty Cobb, who is overseeing the President\u2019s response to the Russia investigation, said McGahn isn\u2019t withholding documents from Mueller\u2019s team related to his time in the White House. \u201cI have no reason to believe McGahn won\u2019t fully cooperate,\u201d Cobb said. McGahn and his private attorney for the Mueller investigation, William Burck, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \u201cWe want the special counsel to be able to say he got everything he asked for, so the American people can trust what he decides,\u201d Cobb said. Nor does Cobb see a reason to take Mueller to court over information they\u2019d like to withhold, he said. In past independent counsel investigations, lawyers in the executive branch have tried that strategy. They\u2019ve attempted to resist disclosing conversations with presidents. A government lawyer\u2019s ability to stay silent could involve both executive privilege, a special confidentiality for the President\u2019s conversations with his advisers, and attorney-client privilege, which protects lawyers\u2019 conversations with their clients. A federal court famously ordered a deputy White House counsel, Bruce Lindsey, to testify before a grand jury about potential criminal wrongdoing in Ken Starr\u2019s investigation of President Bill Clinton. Lindsey, a lawyer who normally would have attorney-client privilege, represented the office of the presidency and not the President himself, the court found. Decades earlier, the Supreme Court ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes in a ruling related to executive privilege. \u201cThe independent counsel wanted Mr. Lindsey\u2019s testimony because he was close to the President, would have been in the critical meetings with the President and if the President had confided with or spoken with anybody, it would have been Mr. Lindsey,\u201d said Eggleston, who had argued for the White House in the Lindsey case. The Mueller investigation already succeeded once in getting around attorney-client privilege. A court challenge about client confidentiality arose during the investigations into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates. Federal prosecutors wanted Manafort\u2019s and Gates\u2019 lawyer, Melissa Laurenza, to testify about their foreign lobbying registrations. She resisted, then the chief judge of the federal court in Washington agreed that she should have to testify, because Manafort and Gates involved her in the foreign agents registration-related crime they\u2019re accused of committing. Laurenza, who worked for Manafort and Gates on filing their lobbying disclosures, is not accused of any wrongdoing. Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty. McGahn still has one window where he could assert attorney-client privilege, when he served as a private lawyer to Trump\u2019s campaign. Generally, White House staff members most often defer to executive privilege when Congress presses them for certain documents and information. In practice, only the President can assert executive privilege, so it\u2019s not a staffer\u2019s choice whether to assert it. Investigators in criminal probes also have been able to overcome claims of executive privilege. While the White House has not pressed for executive privilege, several administration officials have refused to answer questions from Congress. Some have cited the President\u2019s potential future use of executive privilege. In October, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declined to answer several questions about his private conversations with the President before the Senate. He said at the time that the President might want to assert his executive privilege later. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, didn\u2019t force the President to use that confidentiality tool, so Sessions never had to answer. Last week, Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who\u2019s the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, asked Kushner for more documents than he had turned over to Congress. Feinstein and Grassley said the White House claimed Kushner\u2019s lawyer sought to keep some of that information confidential under a possible use of executive privilege. Kushner\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell, in his response to the Senate and in conversations with CNN after, didn\u2019t directly address whether his client has deferred to executive privilege to refrain from turning over documents. \u201cIn my communication with the Senate Judiciary Committee, I said take these documents and let\u2019s talk about what else is relevant,\u201d he told CNN last week. He added that Kushner has been cooperative with committees\u2019 requests. He declined to comment further. McGahn witnessed some of the Trump team\u2019s most crucial moments dealing with Flynn and Comey before they were fired. Flynn is under investigation for his lobbying work related to Turkey, according to previous CNN reporting. The FBI has also scrutinized Flynn\u2019s dealings with Russia\u2019s ambassador during the presidential transition. Neither Flynn nor Trump have been accused of wrongdoing. McGahn spoke with former acting Attorney General Sally Yates about Flynn less than a week after the inauguration. Yates, an Obama appointee whom Trump also fired, said she warned McGahn about Flynn\u2019s international work. She said Flynn had lied to the vice president about talks he had on Russian sanctions before Trump took office, according to her May congressional testimony. She also told McGahn that the FBI interviewed Flynn. Mueller later inherited that FBI investigation, which now delves into Russian election meddling, potential collusion with Russians by the Trump campaign and potential obstruction of justice as it reacted to the probe. Flynn lost his White House job in February. The Comey firing similarly put McGahn in a central role. As White House counsel, McGahn objected to a termination letter Trump wanted to send to Comey in May, according to The New York Times. McGahn marked up sections of it and suggested changes. Mueller\u2019s office has a copy of the letter, the Times reported in September. It\u2019s not clear how much of the letter addressed Trump\u2019s frustration with the Russia investigation. McGahn also warned the President that firing Comey wouldn\u2019t stop the Russia investigation, and arranged for the President to meet with Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to talk about Comey. Trump fired Comey the next day, using a letter from Rosenstein as the initial justification.",

Jeb Hensarling emailed Tuesday about his plans not to run for re-election The Dallas-area congressman is one of many Republicans passing on another bid Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the powerful chairman of the House financial services committee, announced Tuesday that he will not seek re-election in 2018. Hensarling, who represents Dallas, hails from a Republican-heavy district. His departure may not open an opportunity for Democrats, but it does represent another prominent GOP member of Congress who has chosen to call it quits during the tumultuous early days of the Trump administration. In an email sent to his supporters, Hensarling said that it was never his intention to make congressional service a career. \u201cAlthough service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,\u201d Hensarling said. As chairman of the financial services committee, Hensarling is a key player in the ongoing negotiations by Republicans to reform the American tax code. In his statement, he promised that despite his decision to not run for re-election, he has every intention of working to make sure tax reform passes the House. \u201cMuch work remains at the House financial services committee in the areas of housing finance reform, regulatory relief, cybersecurity and capital formation to name just a few,\u201d he said. \u201cFurthermore, important work remains in the Congress as a whole \u2013 especially pro-growth tax reform.\u201d Hensarling, a conservative and former chairman of the Republican Study Committee, is also a key conduit between the GOP caucus and the White House through his close relationship with Vice President Mike Pence. He is at least the 21st Republican member of the House of Representatives to pass on a re-election bid since President Donald Trump has taken office.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bob Corker has critiqued President Donald Trump before He was under consideration by the transition team to join Trump's cabinet President Donald Trump and Sen. Bob Corker are once again having a public spat, exposing a tumultuous relationship between two high-profile Republicans that could have a major impact on their party\u2019s plans for governing and policy. The ongoing public feud between Corker and Trump exploded Tuesday ahead of the President\u2019s high-stakes visit to Capitol Hill for tax negotiations, with the Tennessee Republican telling CNN\u2019s Manu Raju he wouldn\u2019t support Trump for president if given the opportunity again. The President had earlier accused Corker, who has said he will not run for re-election in 2018, of blocking his party\u2019s efforts on tax cuts. The off-message exchange between the two men escalates a rift that has highlighted divisions between Trump and several Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill at a critical time for his tax agenda. Here\u2019s a look at some of Trump and Corker\u2019s public interactions: Corker stopped short of endorsing Trump, but he praised Trump\u2019s evolution as a politician. Calling Trump\u2019s foreign policy address the day before a \u201creally good transition in the campaign,\u201d Corker commended Trump for \u201cchallenging the foreign policy establishment that has been here for so long.\u201d Corker, who at the time was rumored to be on Trump\u2019s shortlist for vice president, said that he had \u201ca good meeting about foreign policy and domestic issues\u201d with the then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Corker, who said he\u2019d never met with Trump before, downplayed the VP speculation, adding he had no reason to believe he was being considered for the #2 slot. Instead, the Senate foreign relations committee chairman said he met with Trump at his namesake tower in New York to discuss China, Russia and other foreign and domestic policy issues. \u201cWe had never talked except on the phone,\u201d said Corker after the meeting. \u201cIt was more of a get-to-know-each-other kind of meeting. It was really more of a policy meeting.\u201d Corker told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that he knew he was \u201cin the mix\u201d for secretary of state of Trump\u2019s Cabinet during the transition. \u201cI also understand that there are people who are very close to the campaign who have had long term friendships who are also in the mix,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my sense is that those people are being looked at very closely right now so we\u2019ll see how it turns out.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to be in the mix so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Trump would eventually choose Rex Tillerson to be his secretary of state. Corker is among the congressional Republicans who appears openly critical of the Trump White House amid a series of scandals to be made public in May. \u201cThey are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that\u2019s happening,\u201d Corker told reporters, his comments coming after reports surfaced that Trump had revealed sensitive intelligence to Russia\u2019s foreign minister and US ambassador. Corker continued, \u201cYou know the shame of it is there\u2019s a really good national security team in place, there\u2019s good productive things that are underway through them, and through others. But the chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think \u2014 it creates a worrisome environment.\u201d Corker slammed Trump\u2019s handling of the racially motivated protests in Charlottesville, charging that the President \u201chas not demonstrated he understands the character of this nation.\u201d The Tennessee Republican told reporters in Chattanooga, Tennessee, that he thought there must be \u201cradical changes\u201d within the White House. \u201cThe President has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\u201d Corker said, according to a video posted by local news website Nooga.com. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders fired back at Corker who said Trump hasn\u2019t demonstrated the \u201cstability\u201d or \u201ccompetence\u201d he needs to display as president. \u201cI think that\u2019s a ridiculous and outrageous claim that doesn\u2019t dignify a response from this podium,\u201d Sanders said at the time, in the White House\u2019s first response to the comments. The sharp rebuke in August by Corker set off a torrent of criticism from the White House, with Trump tweeting about the episode. \u201cStrange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in \u201918,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cTennessee not happy!\u201d Asked about that tweet, Corker said: \u201cI thought his tweet was fine.\u201d Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy! Corker said he\u2019s had \u201cmultiple interactions\u201d with senior officials at the White House since the flap, and said \u201cno question my relationship is just the same as it was before.\u201d \u201cOh, I mean, I talk to the President about almost everything,\u201d Corker said. \u201cWe spend a lot of time together. We play golf. We, you know, they talked to me about being potentially vice president, secretary of state, so I\u2019ve had multiple conversations about the future with lots of people. So, I\u2019m sure when we played golf, the topic came up.\u201d Corker told CNN\u2019s Raju he is weighing whether to call it quits next year. Corker said that he has not made a decision about his future, and appeared to confirm Trump\u2019s tweet that he asked the President for political advice about whether to run for reelection. \u201cAs far as what am I going to do in the future, I\u2019m still contemplating the future,\u201d Corker said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous privilege to do what I do, and to weigh in on the big issues. \u2026 But I have not decided what I\u2019m going to do in the future.\u201d Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Corker was asked about his relationship with the President. \u201cOur relationship is very, very strong. We have a one-on-one private meeting tomorrow at 1 p.m. ET,\u201d he told reporters at a news conference. \u201cFor people to act as if there\u2019s daylight between us, that just is not true.\u201d Corker met with the President at the White House on a Friday afternoon. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Republican did not reveal much about what the two men said to each other, describing it as a \u201cvery productive one-on-one discussion.\u201d \u201cSenator Corker and President Trump had a very productive one-on-one discussion before key members of the White House staff joined them to talk through a number of domestic and foreign policy issues,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe conversations were wide ranging and extremely constructive. In all, they were together for well over an hour.\u201d Corker announced he will retire at the end of 2018. \u201cAfter much thought, consideration and family discussion over the past year, Elizabeth and I have decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018,\u201d Corker said in a released statement. Corker said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \u201chelp separate our country from chaos.\u201d \u201cI think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos, and I support them very much,\u201d the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee told reporters Wednesday on Capitol Hill. When asked about the relationship between Trump and Tillerson, which is reportedly on thin ice, Corker suggested that the secretary of state doesn\u2019t have the support he needs from the President. \u201cI mean, look, I see what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI deal with people throughout the administration and (Tillerson), from my perspective, is in an incredibly frustrating place, where, as I watch, OK, and I can watch very closely on many occasions, I mean you know, he ends up being not being supported in the way I would hope a secretary of state would be supported, that\u2019s just from my vantage point.\u201d Trump tweeted in a series of posts attacking Corker that he denied the senator\u2019s request for an endorsement \u2013 a claim denied by Corker\u2019s chief of staff, Todd Womack, later in the day. \u201cSenator Bob Corker \u2018begged\u2019 me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said \u2018NO\u2019 and he dropped out (said he could not win without\u2026\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201c..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said \u201cNO THANKS.\u201d He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!\u201d \u201c\u2026Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn\u2019t have the guts to run!\u201d Trump added. Senator Bob Corker \"begged\" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said \"NO\" and he dropped out (said he could not win without... ...Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run! \u201cThe President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,\u201d Womack said in a statement. The President continued to slam Corker in a tweet in the late afternoon. \u201cBob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that\u2019s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\u201d he wrote. Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done! Trump told Corker he was going to endorse him the day the Tennessee Republican announced his intention to retire, two sources familiar with the discussions said. The senator responded to Trump\u2019s tweets with an insult later in the morning, calling the White House \u201can adult day care center\u201d in a Twitter post. It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. Then, later that night, Corker told The New York Times that Trump is setting the country \u201con the path to World War III.\u201d He also said Trump is a President who is acting \u201clike he\u2019s doing \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 or something.\u201d \u201cHe concerns me,\u201d Corker added. \u201cHe would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\u201d In a series of tweets, the President accused Corker of fighting tax cuts and called him a \u201clightweight.\u201d Corker responded by again likening the White House staff to a daycare center. \u201cBob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn\u2019t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cCorker dropped out of the race in Tennessee when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!\u201d Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts.... ...Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record! Corker soon responded on Twitter: \u201cSame untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff.\u201d Trump\u2019s criticism appears to stem from Corker\u2019s refusal to support a tax plan that adds to the deficit after factoring in economic growth projections, which depending on how the Republicans develop their tax plan, could be the case. Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff Later Corker, asked in an interview with CNN if he should have backed Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, said he \u201cwould not do that again.\u201d He also said Trump has \u201cgreat difficulty with the truth.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t support him again?\u201d Raju asked. \u201cNo, no way,\u201d Corker said. Corker said Trump has \u201cproven himself unable to rise to the occasion.\u201d \u201cI think many of us, me included, have tried to, you know, intervene, and I have had a private dinner and have been with him on multiple occasions to try and create some kind of aspirational approach, if you will, to the way that he conducts himself,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that that\u2019s possible. He\u2019s obviously not going to rise to the occasion as president.\u201d After the CNN interview aired, Trump tweeted, \u201cIsn\u2019t it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn\u2019t get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!\u201d Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, & look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn't have a clue as..... He tweeted shortly after: \u201cSen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, & look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn\u2019t have a clue as\u2026.. \u2026the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle\u2019 Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!\u201d ...the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!

            "article_content": "Gorsuch hailed by some as the second coming of Justice Antonin Scalia Trump nomination keeps campaign promise made to white evangelicals Several days before President Donald Trump announced the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, he predicted that \u201cevangelicals, Christians will love my pick.\u201d If early reaction holds, Trump\u2019s hunch rings true. In the hours since Gorsuch\u2019s nomination was announced, dozens of conservative Christians have hailed the judge as the second coming of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a favorite figure of the religious right for decades. Scalia died last February, and his seat has since been open. Russell Moore, who leads the ethics and public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, called Gorsuch a \u201cbrilliant and articulate defender of constitutional originalism.\u201d Moment of prayer last night after my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for #SCOTUS. It was an honor having Maureen and Fr. Scalia join us. pic.twitter.com/caYOwmeMuG \u201cHis career is one that exemplifies the very best of intellectually robust conservatism, judicial restraint and faithfulness to the Constitution,\u201d said Moore, whose denomination has some 17 million members. In nominating Gorsuch, Trump fulfills a campaign promise to a powerful voting bloc, white evangelicals, a whopping 81% of whom voted for him. Overall, white evangelicals composed 26% of the electorate in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. Gorsuch, who attends an Episcopal church, has been on the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit since 2006, when he was nominated by then-President George W. Bush. In his acceptance speech on Tuesday, the judge said his faith and his family \u201care the things that keep me grounded at life\u2019s peaks and have sustained me in its valleys.\u201d If conservative Christians praised the judge, particularly for his opinions on two religious freedom cases, atheists just as quickly condemned him. Both non-believers and evangelicals view the Supreme Court as essential to their political future, and the early clash between two of the country\u2019s largest religious groups forebodes a fierce battle over Gorsuch\u2019s Senate confirmation. \u201cNow more than ever we need a Supreme Court that will courageously uphold our foundational rights, not return us to a time of greater Christian privilege,\u201d said Robyn Blumner, head of Center for Inquiry, a humanist group headquartered in New York.   \u201cThere is little evidence that Judge Gorsuch is up to this crucial task.\u201d Though non-religious Americans are not nearly as politically organized or ideologically united as evangelicals, they comprise a large and growing swath of the population. Nearly 1 in 4 of American adults is a \u201cnone,\u201d as in \u201cno religious affiliation,\u201d and some say they have been galvanized by Trump\u2019s election. Since November 8, hundreds of first-time donors have contributed to the Secular Coalition for America, a lobbying group that represents 19 secular and atheist groups, said Larry Decker, the coalition\u2019s president. Annual donors have increased the size of their gifts as well. \u201cThe Supreme Court is extremely important to the secular community in America, and we are extremely concerned about this nominee,\u201d said Decker. \u201cWe are going to lobby as hard as we can and activate our grassroots network.\u201d Many evangelicals voted for Trump precisely because of the Supreme Court, said Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois. In a Christianity Today article, 70% of white evangelical voters said the Supreme Court appointment was a top election concern, Stetzer wrote in a column. \u201cThe Supreme Court nomination is a critical position to fill in light of the changing political and societal changes we have been facing.\u201d Other scholars have contested that argument, citing a 2016 LifeWay Research poll in which only 10% of white evangelicals listed Supreme Court nominees as their top issue when voting for president. Nearly half said improving the economy or national security was their top issue. In any case, conservative Christians were clearly thrilled on Tuesday night, when Trump announced Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, an evangelical media ministry, said he was \u201cgreatly encouraged\u201d by Trump\u2019s choice for the Supreme Court. The Rev. David Jeremiah, senior pastor of the Shadow Mountain Community Church in California, called Gorsuch a \u201creliable conservative.\u201d Bill Donohue of the Catholic League said the nominee will \u201cput a premium on our two most important rights: the right to life, from fertilization to natural death, and religious liberty for all.\u201d Even fierce Trump critics praised his Supreme Court pick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that, for evangelical Christians, the Supreme Court nomination and all the issues that flow from the Supreme Court, were the most important reasons to support Trump,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an evangelical who vociferously opposed Trump. \u201cAnd Gorsuch is an outstanding pick.\u201d For conservative Christians, the most important cases in Gorsuch\u2019s judicial record concern religious freedom, an area they believe is under attack in a rapidly secularizing country. In Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, Gorsuch held that a company\u2019s rights to religious freedom trump the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. That is, business owners who have sincere religious objections to contraception do not have to offer cost-free coverage to employees. The Supreme Court agreed, extending the concept of religious freedom for the first time from individuals to corporations. In a related case, Gorsuch sided with Catholic nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, who also objected to the contraception mandate, as well as the means the Obama administration offered to gain an exemption from it. And while he has not ruled directly on abortion, Gorsuch has argued in favor of allowing a state to block funding of Planned Parenthood and written a book arguing against the legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia. Those arguments make many atheists nervous about Gorsuch. \u201cHe has favored religious institutions over individuals,\u201d said Decker, referring to the Hobby Lobby case. Secularists are also wary of government interference in the \u201cright to die,\u201d and have celebrated recent laws, like one passed in Washington last year, that allow terminally ill people to hasten their deaths. In opposing Gorsuch, Decker said, atheists will be reaching out to secular and religious groups with similar concerns. Already, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and a liberal New York seminary have expressed doubts about the Supreme Court nominee.",

Bob Corker said Tuesday he will retire at the end of 2018. \u201cAfter much thought, consideration and family discussion over the past year, Elizabeth and I have decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018,\u201d Corker said in a released statement. Corker is the Senate\u2019s foreign relations committee chairman and had told CNN earlier this month that he was considering whether to run again. \u201cWhen I ran for the Senate in 2006, I told people that I couldn\u2019t imagine serving for more than two terms,\u201d Corker said in his statement Tuesday. \u201cUnderstandably, as we have gained influence, that decision has become more difficult. But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model, and while I realize it is not for everyone, I believe with the kind of service I provide, it is the right one for me.\u201d Corker, who was at one time among those considered a candidate to be President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state, had been increasingly critical of the President in recent months. \u201cThe President has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\u201d Corker said last month, according to a video posted by local news website Nooga.com, in reference to Trump\u2019s handling of violence related to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump and his press secretary responded with their own criticism. Corker later said he had a \u201cstrong\u201d relationship with the President, and the two had a meeting at the White House on September 15. But sources familiar with private conversations between Trump and Corker told CNN the two made up since their August fight, and that the President wanted Corker to run for reelection.

The Tennessee Republican has gained prominence in the Senate as an outspoken leader on not just foreign relations, but also on domestic issues. He\u2019s also well-connected to GOP leadership and is only in his second term. In his statement Tuesday, Corker said that he believed \u201cthe most important public service\u201d he had to offer would come in upcoming months. \u201cI want to be able to do that as thoughtfully and independently as I did the first 10 years and nine months of my Senate career,\u201d Corker said. \u201cServing the people of Tennessee in this capacity has been the greatest privilege of my life. And as I spent the month of August traveling across our great state, I was reminded that we live in a unique place full of people who care deeply about the direction of our country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New phase will bring fresh challenges Next few months key in terms of witnesses and gathering documents Lawyers working with a team led by special counsel Robert Mueller approached the Senate intelligence committee this summer with a request: They wanted the transcript of an interview Senate staff had conducted with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. But they were blocked. Manafort\u2019s lawyers said they had not authorized Mueller\u2019s legal team to access the interview transcript under the agreement with the committee, even though Mueller\u2019s attorneys said they had been given permission. The matter is still under discussion, sources say. The previously undisclosed fight, described to CNN by multiple sources, underscores the new challenges as congressional committees and Mueller\u2019s operation head into a more intense phase of their parallel \u2013 and sometimes, conflicting \u2013 investigations into Russian election meddling and any collusion with Trump associates. There are three committees on Capitol Hill competing for information and witnesses \u2013 and there is little, if any, communication among them, even as congressional officials say they all are preparing to intensify the pace of their inquiries this fall. While the Hill investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling have been underway since the beginning of the year, the next few months could be the most consequential in terms of hearing from witnesses and gathering documents, sources say. NYT: Mueller obtained draft of letter Trump wrote explaining Comey firing That could mean early signs of tension between the special counsel and the Hill become more pronounced as the competing congressional inquiries try to determine whether there was any collusion and as Mueller potentially pursues criminal charges. Top lawmakers on the committees say they have confidence they can avoid conflicts with Mueller\u2019s team, but the investigations have different purposes. Mueller\u2019s is geared toward prosecuting potential crimes. If no charges result, there\u2019s no guarantee the public will find out what Mueller found in his inquiry. Mueller\u2019s team has employed some aggressive tactics. In one such case, Mueller\u2019s team may have obtained evidence in the raid of Manafort\u2019s home that was not covered by the search warrant, sources told CNN. Moreover, Mueller\u2019s team has kept top lawmakers mostly out of the loop about the developments in its inquiry and has urged Congress to schedule testimony of some key witnesses in public session \u2013 to avoid the possibility that the special counsel may be blocked from accessing information given to the committees privately. But lawmakers, who take pride in their oversight role, have instead moved forward with private witness interviews, including Donald Trump Jr., who is expected to head to the Senate intelligence committee this month, sources say, and is expected to meet with the Senate judiciary committee as well. The Senate intelligence panel is considering holding public hearings this fall with some key witnesses, according to a source familiar with the private talks. And, sources said, the committee is now searching for new details around the late Republican operative Peter Smith, who claimed he tried to obtain Clinton emails hacked by the Russians during the last election season. Across the Capitol, the House intelligence committee now is increasingly focused on the past efforts by Trump associates to move forward on a Trump Tower project in Moscow, sources familiar with the probe told CNN, a matter almost certainly under review by Mueller\u2019s team as well. Plus the House panel is now trying to get its hands on a draft memo that reportedly included President Donald Trump\u2019s initial justification in his firing of then-FBI Director James Comey \u2013 a memo that Mueller already has but one that the committee may need to access through the White House rather than the special counsel. \u201cIt\u2019s probably past time for our committee to subpoena the White House to make sure we get all relevant documents,\u201d California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CNN. On Capitol Hill, the closed-door transcribed interviews are causing complications in the delicate relationship with the special counsel. After Manafort privately interviewed with Senate intelligence committee staff in late July to discuss the June 2016 meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian operatives, Mueller\u2019s lawyers have struggled to get a copy of the interview transcript. Manafort\u2019s attorneys, in talks with the special counsel\u2019s office, agreed to allow Mueller\u2019s team only to get the documents Manafort had turned over to the committee, not the interview transcript, according to the sources. Special counsel subpoenas Manafort's former attorney and spokesman Yet an attorney with the Mueller team later told the committee that they were authorized by Manafort\u2019s representatives to have the Manafort interview transcript, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Committee lawyers later learned from Manafort\u2019s attorneys that they had not provided that consent, the sources say. As a result of the dispute, the committee hasn\u2019t turned over any documents and the matter is still under discussion, sources say. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment, as did a Manafort spokesman and the intelligence committee. Mueller has privately met with leaders of the main three committees investigating the Russian election meddling, in an effort to \u201cdeconflict\u201d with Capitol Hill to ensure the two sides are not in conflict when it comes to witnesses. But sharing information hasn\u2019t always been easy. After weeks of demands on Capitol Hill for memos Comey wrote describing his interactions with Trump, including when the President allegedly asked him to drop the FBI investigation into his ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, top lawmakers eventually got to see it \u2013 with conditions. The leaders of the Senate judiciary committee, for instance, could read the memos but not take notes or get copies of them, sources said. The aggressive tactics by Mueller\u2019s team extend beyond Capitol Hill. He has put enormous pressure on Manafort \u2013 someone who is also in the crosshairs on the Hill given his past work with a pro-Russian Ukranian political party. Mueller issued subpoenas to Manafort\u2019s former lawyer and current spokesman and authorized a pre-dawn raid of his Virginia home in late July. During that raid, Mueller\u2019s investigators took documents considered to be covered by attorney-client privilege, sources told CNN. FBI raided Manafort home as part of Russia probe Lawyers from the WilmerHale law firm, representing Manafort at the time, warned Mueller\u2019s office that their search warrant didn\u2019t allow access to attorney materials. The documents in question have now been returned, the sources say. The episode raised questions about whether investigators have seen materials they weren\u2019t entitled to obtain. \u201cYou can\u2019t unsee something,\u201d one source said. It\u2019s not an uncommon problem in FBI investigations. US attorneys typically have separate document-review teams to prevent investigators from handling materials they aren\u2019t allowed to have. It\u2019s not clear what procedures Mueller\u2019s office uses. Mueller\u2019s spokesman declined to comment. After meeting with Mueller earlier this summer, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said it was not necessary for the committee leaders to meet with Mueller again. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be in communication personally with him on any aspects that might bleed over from one to the other,\u201d he told CNN. Each of the three committees received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the Trump campaign about communications involving Russia, and aides to each of the panels have spent the August recess digging through the documents. This week, members of each of the committees will be briefed on some of the findings and will discuss new leads they will want to chase, lawmakers said. One area of intense interest surrounds Trump attorney Michael Cohen and Russian-American businessman Felix Sater \u2013 both of whom are expected to be called to meet with the House intelligence committee and likely the Senate panel as well. In emails provided to Congress, both men discussed efforts to move forward on a Trump Tower project in Moscow and sought to get help from the highest levels of the Kremlin, undercutting the President\u2019s repeated claims of not having any business in Russia. Trump attorney reached out to Kremlin to pursue Moscow Trump Tower project Cohen was scheduled to meet with the House panel this week but has rescheduled his interview, according to people familiar with the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s A-level interest,\u201d said one source close to the House inquiry, referring to the Trump Tower project in Moscow. But that\u2019s hardly the lone area that lawmakers plan to probe nor the last big-name witness expected to be called in to testify. Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s son-in-law who attended the June 2016 Russia meeting with Trump Jr. and had multiple contacts with Russian officials last year, is expected to be called back to meet with senators after he met with just Senate staff in July, senators said. The Russians who attended the Trump Tower meeting also remain of high interest to the panels. Roger Stone, the President\u2019s longtime friend and adviser whose name has often surfaced as part of the Russia probe, could meet with the House panel as soon as this month, sources said. It\u2019s unclear when he\u2019ll meet with senators. And the Senate intelligence committee is pushing to obtain new information about the unusual circumstances surrounding Smith, the veteran GOP operative who told The Wall Street Journal he was on a mission to obtain the hacked Clinton emails. After the stories about his efforts were published this summer, Smith killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room. Matt Tait, a cybersecurity expert who publicly acknowledged in July being contacted by Smith, is among those the Senate panel is interested in hearing from, sources said. Tait declined to comment to CNN. Lawmakers are trying to learn whether that\u2019s an area the special counsel is probing as well.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bob Corker is up for reelection next year in a solidly red state: Tennessee Still the chairman of the foreign relations committee says he's mulling his future Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the influential chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee who was once considered for a spot in President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, is weighing whether to call it quits next year. Corker told CNN last week that he has not made a decision about his future, and appeared to confirm Trump\u2019s tweet that he asked the President for political advice about whether to run for reelection. \u201cAs far as what am I going to do in the future, I\u2019m still contemplating the future,\u201d Corker said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous privilege to do what I do, and to weigh in on the big issues. \u2026 But I have not decided what I\u2019m going to do in the future.\u201d If Corker, 65, were to retire, it\u2019d be a huge surprise in the Senate given his perch sitting atop a powerful committee, his alliance with the Senate leadership and the fact that he\u2019s only in his second term. Plus it would give Democrats a new shot to pick up another Senate seat, although it still would be an uphill climb given that the state is still a solid GOP stronghold. A source familiar with Corker\u2019s thinking said the Republican is legitimately torn about whether to remain in the body another six years or to return to his roots in the business sector. A list of who's leaving Congress But the source said Corker is taking steps to prepare for a run, raising money for a bid with $7.5 million in cash on hand. Plus, he\u2019s hired a seasoned political operative as a general consultant, Ward Baker, who led the GOP\u2019s Senate campaign committee in the party\u2019s successful 2016 election cycle. Still, it\u2019s unclear to people close to Corker whether he will run or call it quits \u2013 or when he will make a final decision. And, the source said, the senator has spoken to many people about his deliberations, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is urging him to run again. Corker came into the spotlight in August, when he sharply criticized Trump in the aftermath of the President\u2019s handling of the deadly violence during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the time, Corker said: \u201cThe President has not yet, has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful. And we need for him to be successful. Our nation needs to be successful.\u201d Corker added: \u201cHe has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today.\u201d Asked last week if he still stood by that sentiment, Corker told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t make comments like the ones I\u2019ve made without thinking them through in advance.\u201d The sharp rebuke in August set off a torrent of criticism from the White House, with press secretary Sarah Sanders calling it a \u201cridiculous and outrageous claim\u201d at the time and Trump tweeting about the episode. \u201cStrange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in \u201918,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cTennessee not happy!\u201d Asked about that tweet, Corker said: \u201cI thought his tweet was fine.\u201d Corker said he\u2019s had \u201cmultiple interactions\u201d with senior officials at the White House since the flap, and said \u201cno question my relationship is just the same as it was before.\u201d During the campaign, Trump considered Corker as a running mate, and the senator was later a finalist for secretary of state before the President chose Rex Tillerson. Asked if he had spoken with the President about his election plans, Corker said he believed the topic came up when they played golf together. \u201cOh, I mean, I talk to the President about almost everything,\u201d Corker said. \u201cWe spend a lot of time together. We play golf. We, you know, they talked to me about being potentially vice president, secretary of state, so I\u2019ve had multiple conversations about the future with lots of people. So, I\u2019m sure when we played golf, the topic came up.\u201d This story has been updated.",

Bennett, McCourty and Blount directly cited their opposition to Trump as a reason for their boycott, but Brady said the tradition of Super Bowl champs visiting the White House each year \u201cnever really was a political thing\u201d for him. Piling on: More New England Patriots skipping White House visit \u201cPutting politics aside it never really was a political thing \u2013 at least it never was for me,\u201d Brady told NBC Sports. \u201cIt was just always something that was a privilege to be able to do because it really meant you won a championship and you got to experience something cool with your team and your teammates.\u201d The five-time Super Bowl champ has been friends with President Donald Trump for years. He noted his own record of missing a White House visit \u2013 in April 2015, when the team was honored by President Barack Obama. \u201cEverybody has their own choice. There\u2019s certain years, like a couple years ago, I wanted to go, and then didn\u2019t get the opportunity based on the scheduling,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get told until 10 days before we were going and at that point I had something that I had been planning for months.\u201d At the time, a Patriots spokesman told ESPN that Brady had a \u201cfamily commitment. The Patriots have been linked to Trump because of the President\u2019s friendship with Brady, head coach, Bill Belichick, and owner Robert Kraft. Kraft joined Trump last week at Mar-a-Lago, where they dined with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Kraft downplayed reports of his players skipping the White House visit during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Monday, saying that various players choose to skip the White House visit each time but \u201cthis is the first time it\u2019s gotten any media attention.\u201d \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve had the privilege of going to the White House, a dozen of our players don\u2019t go,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s gotten any media attention \u2026 Some of the players have the privilege of going in college because they\u2019re on national championship teams, (and) others have family commitments.\u201d Why athletes are getting more political in the age of Trump Kraft told The New York Times last month that Trump is going \u201cto be great for the economic side of America.\u201d \u201cLoyalty is important to me, and he has been a wonderful friend,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cI think one of the great problems in the country today is the working poor, the middle class, that there hasn\u2019t been growth in income on an equal basis, and I really think the policies he\u2019s going to bring to bear are going to be great for the economic side of America.\u201d But Brady, who faced controversy during the 2016 election when a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat was spotted in his locker, has been evasive when asked about Trump, keeping his comments non-political.",

            "article_content": "Ivanka Trump could benefit from a clean slate Some of her efforts have been largely overshadowed by other news The White House was in full reset mode Monday \u2014 former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was sworn in as chief of staff at 9:30 a.m. ET, and by mid-afternoon, communications director Anthony Scaramucci was ousted just days after he joined the Trump team. But another top aide to the President was working on a quiet reset of her own. After a summer of bruising headlines for both her and her husband around the Paris climate agreement, the President\u2019s tweets on transgender members of the military and the Russia probe, Ivanka Trump was by her father\u2019s side, present at Kelly\u2019s swearing-in, a Cabinet meeting, and later, a Medal of Honor ceremony. Monday\u2019s transitions could provide a clean slate: a new chief of staff and the resulting restructuring could benefit the first daughter and presidential adviser with the space and opportunity to refocus. Despite the noise from media coverage and critics \u2013 and other distractions from her own initiatives \u2013 during the first months of her time in Washington, Ivanka Trump is pushing forward with her West Wing portfolio. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a top White House aide, were supportive of both personnel decisions, according to a White House official. On day 193, Donald Trump (tries) to start over The couple \u201chave a lot of admiration and respect for (Kelly) and his ability to professionalize the West Wing and are eager to follow his lead,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey want this to work,\u201d the official said, reiterating that sentiment later in the day upon news of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Ivanka Trump called Kelly \u201ca true American hero\u201d in a tweet Monday: \u201cLooking forward to serving alongside John Kelly as we work for the American people,\u201d she wrote. Looking forward to serving alongside John Kelly as we work for the American people. General Kelly is a true American hero. pic.twitter.com/XQLuFaS3ce Ivanka Trump, who is expected to appear at multiple public events this week, isn\u2019t exactly doing anything different than before. \u201cShe continues to be focused on the issues in her portfolio and serving the President,\u201d a White House official said. Trump has previously lamented the \u201cviciousness\u201d of the media covering her father\u2019s presidency, referring to the growing \u201ccloud\u201d of distractions resulting from the Russia probe. \u201cIt is hard. And there is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting. I was not expecting the intensity of this experience, but this isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. My father and this administration intends to be transformative, and we want to do big, bold things and we\u2019re looking to change the status quo. So I didn\u2019t expect it to be easy. I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was \u2014 I was a little blindsided by on a personal level,\u201d she told Fox News in a June interview. But the West Wing shakeup \u2013 if it is successful in minimizing damaging leaks and other harmful distractions \u2013 presents Trump with the opportunity to turn over a new leaf and set a new narrative focused on her specific priorities and work. Lawmakers split: Is Scaramucci's departure sign of new order or more chaos? The first daughter has been between a rock and a hard place since formally joining the administration earlier this year: Some Republicans see her as a threat to the President\u2019s conservative agenda while some Democrats say she did little to minimize expectations set in media narratives throughout the campaign and transition that she would be a moderating force for her father on social issues. She sent a subtle message to the critics on Monday, posting a photo of dozens of pieces of fan mail on Instagram. \u201cGrateful to receive these thoughtful letters. Thank you for sharing your kind words! It is an honor and privilege to serve our great country,\u201d she captioned the photo of handwritten notes and drawings all spread out. The first daughter and assistant to the President is subject to an enormous amount of scrutiny, deserved or not, and this summer\u2019s headlines have not been generous: She faced backlash from left-leaning critics in June when her father announced his intent to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. She advocated on behalf of remaining the Paris pact until the very end. What Ivanka Trump lacks in governmental experience, she makes up for with the key asset of knowing her father, how he thinks, and how he makes decisions, better than almost anyone. The first daughter has noted her conversations with her father happen behind the scenes \u2013 and her ability to ultimately shape her father\u2019s positions is largely unknown. He\u2019ll listen to his daughter and other advisers, but ultimately, he makes the decision. \u201cMy father trusts me to be an honest broker,\u201d Trump told The Washington Post in a recent interview. \u201cI don\u2019t have a hidden agenda. I have a very clear agenda. He knows exactly where I stand and I express why I care. There\u2019s no secrecy about it.\u201d Some of her other efforts have been largely overshadowed by other news. The White House\u2019s \u201cWorkforce Development Week,\u201d which she helped spearhead, coincided with the tragic congressional baseball practice shooting that left Republican Rep. Steve Scalise seriously injured. The G-20 Summit rollout of the women\u2019s entrepreneurship facility she helped create alongside the World Bank came the same weekend that the President met face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and reports surfaced that her brother, Donald Trump Jr., met with a woman described to him in emails as a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d during the 2016 campaign. More negative headlines piled up as the summer moved on and her husband, who said himself he is \u201cnot a person who has sought the spotlight,\u201d was called to testify before Congress amid the growing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Kushner sought to put any questions related to the Russia probe behind him, providing closed testimony before the Senate and House intelligence committees and delivering a rare statement before the press outside the West Wing. And last Wednesday, additional negative coverage came as the President announced on Twitter that he was reinstating a ban on transgender individuals from serving \u201cin any capacity\u201d in the US armed forces. His daughter had come out in support of the LGBTQ community at the beginning of Pride Month. \u201cI am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy,\u201d she wrote in June. I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy. Trump reportedly found out about the President\u2019s transgender military ban for the first time when she saw his tweets on the matter, again indicating that she can advise, but the President decides. That development fed a new round of critical headlines, including this from Vogue: \u201cLook, It\u2019s Time to Collectively and Officially Give Up on Ivanka Trump.\u201d New order at WH front and center as Kelly takes helm One clear signal she and Kushner still have her father\u2019s ear: the installation of retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff and removal of Reince Priebus. The new structure means the couple has a new boss. All White House staff now report to the new chief of staff, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at Monday\u2019s press briefing. Pressed on whether that includes staffers like Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Sanders said, \u201cThat includes everybody at the White House.\u201d Moving forward, Ivanka Trump continues to work on her initiatives, including paid family leave, a childcare tax credit, workforce development, ending human trafficking, and promoting education for science technology, engineering and math, among other initiatives. Making the pitch on paid family leave is a key priority for Trump in the coming weeks. The provision in the White House\u2019s proposed budget, which was released in late May, allocates six weeks for new mothers and fathers, including adoptive parents. The proposal allows states to establish their own family leave programs paid for by reforms to the unemployment insurance system. Trump penned an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal last month advocating on its behalf, arguing that paid family leave will \u201chave an especially positive effect for women\u201d and will be critical in \u201csolving the persistent gender and minority pay gap that exists in part because of prolonged periods away from the workforce and challenges with re-entry.\u201d Republicans try to move forward She will continue to meet with lawmakers, a mix of House members and Senators. Trump met with Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in May and she discussed the issue with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in June. She also met with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and a group of congressional Republicans in late June to discuss a series of more general issues. She will attend a White House event on small businesses Tuesday afternoon. But the administration\u2019s proposal faces an uphill battle in Congress, and the White House has acknowledged as much. \u201cWe wanted to take the initiative to present a strong proposal in our budget as a stake in the ground. While we are pleasantly surprised by the progress we are making in building a coalition and it is a priority issue, we are realistic about the calendar,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cWe know how hard it is going to be and that for all the talk on the issue, nobody has been able to get it done before but we are committed to it and the priority now is to build a coalition.\u201d Trump continues her work on other issues, as well. Last week, she traveled to New York to have lunch with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, where the two discussed women\u2019s economic empowerment and workforce development. Great meeting @UN Secretary General @antonioguterres to discuss the critical issues of women's economic empowerment & workforce development. pic.twitter.com/klI6TWN1K2 She was on hand in the East Room as the administration announced a $10 billion initial investment by Foxconn in Wisconsin. She also joined Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to highlight summer reading and STEM at an event with young women at the American History Museum last week. On a related personal front, Trump is leading by example, taking a summer coding class with daughter Arabella, 6. The earlier we can engage girls in fields like STEM the more we can create inclusion for them. @IvankaTrump @BetsyDeVosED @amhistorymuseum pic.twitter.com/uoX6zcqhn4 CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Athena Jones contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A special counsel and congressional committees have intensified their focus The reality of impeachment: politics and public opinion count Clandestine meetings. Special counsels. Congressional probes. Sound familiar? The constellation of headline-driving drama in today\u2019s news recalls the machinations that engulfed Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton for years of their respective tenures. Those episodes offer insight to understanding the still fresh events unfolding around the Trump administration. Forty-three years ago this summer, the US Supreme Court forced President Richard Nixon to turn over White House tapes related to a break-in at the Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate building. The unanimous decision, written by a chief justice appointed by Nixon, represented a judicial climax in the Watergate scandal and heightened the political momentum towards Nixon\u2019s Aug. 8 resignation. Exclusive: Mueller asks WH staff to preserve all documents relating to June 2016 meeting The House judiciary committee voted on articles of impeachment three days after the ruling, and soon after Nixon stalwarts such as conservative Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater intervened to persuade the President to go. \u201cThere are only so many lies you can take,\u201d Goldwater told Republican colleagues on August 6, 1974. \u201cNixon should get his ass out of the White House \u2013 today!\u201d Now, with energy building in the federal investigations into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion by Trump campaign associates with Russian officials, comparisons to Nixon are growing. Special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees have intensified their focus on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort had with a Russian lawyer and others. A Monmouth University poll released this week found that 41% of the public think Trump should be impeached and removed from office (53% disagree). That\u2019s a much larger share than supported impeachment for Nixon in July 1973 when much of the evidence related to Watergate emerged. At the time, 24% supported impeachment and 62% opposed it. By the first week of August 1974, Gallup reported that 57% said Nixon\u2019s actions were serious enough to warrant removal from office. Yet, while the Watergate scandal and, to a lesser extent, the Bill Clinton impeachment efforts nearly 20 years ago provide loose templates for how the current controversy might evolve, much more must develop before it\u2019s evident whether this investigation would destroy Trump\u2019s presidency or constitute a short chapter on his overall tenure. For Trump, all roads lead back to his tax returns The bottom line is it depends on the evidence \u2013 evidence that is now being collected in secret. And as was plain in the fates of Nixon and Clinton, congressional politics and public opinion matter. President Donald Trump has deemed the Russia-related probe \u201cthe greatest witch hunt in American political history.\u201d To last week\u2019s revelations that Trump Jr. met with a well-connected Russian lawyer to gain damaging information on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the President said it was politics as usual. \u201cMy son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think from a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting \u2026 Politics isn\u2019t the nicest business in the world, but it\u2019s very standard, where they have information and you take the information.\u201d The Democratic National Committee burglary that began Nixon\u2019s downfall was June 17, 1972. And Nixon\u2019s resignation came a year after nationally televised Senate hearings in 1973, during which his role in the Watergate cover-up emerged and the presence of a taping system \u2013 which captured Oval Office conversations about the break-in \u2013 was revealed. In March 1974, several top aides, including former Attorney General John Mitchell, were indicted on conspiracy, obstruction of justice and other offenses. The Clinton scandal also took years to develop. Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor, was appointed in 1994. His investigation expanded beyond a Whitewater land deal in the Clintons\u2019 home state of Arkansas to Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who had sued Clinton for sexual harassment, and later to Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern with whom Clinton had an affair. Clinton was not impeached until late 1998. Special counsel Mueller has yet to reveal any results of his Russia-related investigation or possible criminal charges. He was appointed in May after Trump fired FBI director James Comey, who had been overseeing the probe. Comey later testified that Trump had urged him to stop pursuing the Russian connections of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. WaPo & NYT: Trump legal team trying to undercut Mueller The Comey firing recalled the October 20, 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre,\u201d when Nixon sacked then-Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox. Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, refusing Nixon\u2019s order to fire Cox, resigned that same night. Leon Jaworski took over as special prosecutor and continued to seek the White House tapes. In the July 24 Supreme Court opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger said the public\u2019s right to evidence outweighed Nixon\u2019s claim of executive privilege: \u201cThe very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts.\u201d CNN has reported that Mueller\u2019s investigators are following up on the meeting attended by Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner as part of the broader investigation into Russian meddling. Mueller has asked the White House to preserve all documents related to the meeting. The Senate intelligence committee and other congressional panels are also investigating and seeking the testimony of Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner. Across all fronts, investigators are looking for any Trump campaign involvement with the Russians. The Constitution does not address whether a president may be criminally prosecuted, and the Department of Justice has previously said that the president can be removed only through the impeachment process. In 1974, Nixon was not criminally charged; the grand jury named him as an unindicted co-conspirator. The Constitution says grounds for impeachment are \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d A simple majority is needed in the House for articles of impeachment, but conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority (67 votes). Trump reshuffling legal team In Clinton\u2019s case, the Republican-run House passed two articles impeachment in December 1998 related to perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999, failing to reach the necessary two-thirds majority of votes required. (The only other American president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson, in 1868, was not convicted by the Senate either.) Clinton remained relatively popular through the impeachment ordeal. His lowest approval rating in CNN/Gallup/USA Today polling from January 1998 through March of 1999 was 59%. For much of the time the Starr investigation was underway, his approval percentage remained high, in the 60s and 70s. And that is the reality of impeachment: politics and public opinion count. Gallup reported that 37% approve of Trump, 58% disapprove, per their daily tracking poll. Nixon had a 24% approval rating as he resigned, according to Gallup. House impeachment and Senate conviction seemed inevitable. Goldwater, a former presidential candidate and conservative bulwark, told Nixon he lacked the Senate votes for acquittal. Today, Trump has the backing of leaders in the GOP-controlled House and the Senate. Any chance of impeachment appears remote. A more salient question is whether pressure will build, from Mueller, congressional committees, the public, or even the courts, to alter the current dynamic. Correction: This story was updated to reflect that President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868.",

The letter from Mueller began: \u201cAs you are aware the Special Counsel\u2019s office is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump.  Information concerning the June 2016 meeting between Donald J Trump Jr and Natalia Veselnitskaya is relevant to the investigation.\u201d Trump reshuffling legal team The preservation request is broad and includes text messages, emails, notes, voicemails and other communications and documentation regarding the June 2016 meeting and any related communication since then. On Wednesday, the White House counsel\u2019s office sent a notice to White House staff informing them of the document preservation request. A second source confirmed to CNN the letter was sent to White House personnel. Such notices are frequently sent in the early stages of investigation and puts those who receive it on notice of the need to hold on to the material and specifically not to destroy documents that could be relevant to the investigation and requested in the future. For Trump, it always comes back to the tax returns A White House spokeswoman told CNN they don\u2019t comment on internal communications and the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment. CNN reported last week that the White House scramble to respond to revelations about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s emails may have exposed the aides involved to special counsel scrutiny about what they learned about that meeting. White House aides and Kushner\u2019s legal team began strategizing late last month over how to manage the disclosure of newly discovered emails setting up the June 2016 meeting, according to sources close to Kushner\u2019s legal team. Their public relations efforts culminated in a series of stumbles in response to inquiries from media outlets about the June 2016 meeting. Trump tests the limits of presidential power Some of the President\u2019s closest aides, who were traveling with him back from Europe helped strategize about a response for Trump Jr., according to people briefed on the matter. The New York Times first reported on the crafting of the statement. A sensitive legal matter such as this would normally have been handled by the attorneys, given that it was about the Russia investigation. But the President\u2019s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, who is designated to handle personal legal issues, was not traveling with the President and was largely uninvolved, according to the people familiar with the matter. The Times reported last week that the President himself approved the statement, raising the possibility the President may have opened himself up to new legal issues not covered by attorney-client privilege. Jay Sekulow, the President\u2019s attorney, denied that Trump was involved. \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in the statement drafting at all, nor was the President. I\u2019m assuming that was between Mr. Donald Trump Jr., between Don Jr. and his lawyer. I\u2019m sure his lawyer was involved, that\u2019s how you do it,\u201d said Sekulow in an interview on CNN\u2019s New Day.",

            "article_content": "Marc Kasowitz, who has been the lead lawyer on the Russia investigation, will see his role recede Trump has vented in recent weeks that his legal team has not done enough to beat back allegations President Donald Trump is reshuffling his legal team as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation moves full steam ahead. The developments come one day after Trump suggested an aggressive pushback against his investigators, telling The New York Times that Mueller\u2019s office had widespread conflicts of interest while warning investigators any examinations of his family\u2019s finances would be improper. Sources told CNN, however, that these moves were well in the works before the Times interview took place. Marc Kasowitz, Trump\u2019s longtime personal attorney who has been the lead lawyer on the Russia investigation, will see his role recede, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. A third source said Kasowitz\u2019s role is changing because the needs are more Washington-centric and Kasowitz has done his primary job of putting the team together. Instead, attorney John Dowd, along with Jay Sekulow, will now be the President\u2019s primary personal attorneys for the investigation, according to the two sources with knowledge of the situation. Dowd will take the lead. By being outside the White House, their dealings with the President will be protected under attorney-client privilege that is afforded any US citizen, the sources explained. Attorney Ty Cobb will take the lead from inside the White House on the Russia investigation when he formally starts his job on July 31. As CNN reported earlier this month, Cobb will help manage this crisis from a legal and communications perspective. One source with knowledge disputed reports Thursday night in The New York Times and The Washington Post that the legal team is seeking to undermine the Mueller investigation and stressed the intention is to cooperate fully. Meanwhile, Mark Corallo has resigned from his position as spokesman and communications strategist for Trump\u2019s legal team. WaPo & NYT: Trump legal team trying to undercut Mueller Corallo told CNN Friday morning, \u201cI resigned yesterday\u201d and declined to comment further about his departure. His resignation comes after weeks of simmering tension between the White House and the President\u2019s legal team. Trump has vented in recent weeks that his legal team has not done enough to beat back allegations linked to the federal investigations into Russian efforts to influence last year\u2019s election. He has decried the investigations as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d And the legal team has complained about the President and the White House\u2019s response to revelations concerning the Russia probe \u2013 including the President\u2019s refusal to heed their advice not to publicly discuss or tweet about the Russia investigation and with the White House\u2019s handling of reports connected to the probe, sources said. ABC News first reported Corallo\u2019s resignation. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump spoke Thursday in Warsaw, Poland, on his second international trip as President. These are his full remarks with first lady Melania Trump, as transcribed by the White House. MRS. TRUMP:  Hello, Poland!  Thank you very much.  My husband and I have enjoyed visiting your beautiful country.  I want to thank President and Mrs. Duda for the warm welcome and their generous hospitality.  I had the opportunity to visit the Copernicus Science Centre today, and found it not only informative but thoughtful, its mission, which is to inspire people to observe, experiment, ask questions, and seek answers. I can think of no better purpose for such a wonderful science center.  Thank you to all who were involved in giving us the tour, especially the children who made it such a wonderful experience. As many of you know, a main focus of my husband\u2019s presidency is safety and security of the American people.  I think all of us can agree people should be able to live their lives without fear, no matter what country they live in.  That is my wish for all of us around the world.  (Applause.) Thank you again for this wonderful welcome to your very special country.  Your kindness and gracious hospitality will not be forgotten.  (Applause.) And now it is my honor to introduce to you my husband, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.) Conservative Polish politicians bus people in for Trump speech PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  That\u2019s so nice.  The United States has many great diplomats, but there is truly no better ambassador for our country than our beautiful First Lady, Melania.  Thank you, Melania.  That was very nice.  (Applause.) We\u2019ve come to your nation to deliver a very important message:  America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people.  (Applause.)  Thank you. The Poles have not only greatly enriched this region, but Polish-Americans have also greatly enriched the United States, and I was truly proud to have their support in the 2016 election.  (Applause.) It is a profound honor to stand in this city, by this monument to the Warsaw Uprising, and to address the Polish nation that so many generations have dreamed of:  a Poland that is safe, strong, and free.  (Applause.) President Duda and your wonderful First Lady, Agata, have welcomed us with the tremendous warmth and kindness for which Poland is known around the world.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  My sincere \u2013 and I mean sincerely thank both of them.  And to Prime Minister Syzdlo, a very special thanks also.  (Applause.) We are also pleased that former President Leck Walesa, so famous for leading the Solidarity Movement, has joined us today, also.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. On behalf of all Americans, let me also thank the entire Polish people for the generosity you have shown in welcoming our soldiers to your country.  These soldiers are not only brave defenders of freedom, but also symbols of America\u2019s commitment to your security and your place in a strong and democratic Europe. We are proudly joined on stage by American, Polish, British, and Romanian soldiers.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Great job. President Duda and I have just come from an incredibly successful meeting with the leaders participating in the Three Seas Initiative.  To the citizens of this great region, America is eager to expand our partnership with you.  We welcome stronger ties of trade and commerce as you grow your economies. And we are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy, so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy.  (Applause.) Mr. President, I congratulate you, along with the President of Croatia, on your leadership of this historic Three Seas Initiative.  Thank you.  (Applause.) President Trump visits Poland, Germany This is my first visit to Central Europe as President, and I am thrilled that it could be right here at this magnificent, beautiful piece of land.  It is beautiful.  (Applause.)  Poland is the geographic heart of Europe, but more importantly, in the Polish people, we see the soul of Europe.  Your nation is great because your spirit is great and your spirit is strong.  (Applause.) For two centuries, Poland suffered constant and brutal attacks.  But while Poland could be invaded and occupied, and its borders even erased from the map, it could never be erased from history or from your hearts.  In those dark days, you have lost your land but you never lost your pride.  (Applause.) So it is with true admiration that I can say today, that from the farms and villages of your countryside to the cathedrals and squares of your great cities, Poland lives, Poland prospers, and Poland prevails.  (Applause.) Despite every effort to transform you, oppress you, or destroy you, you endured and overcame.  You are the proud nation of Copernicus \u2013 think of that \u2013 (applause) \u2013 Chopin, Saint John Paul II.  Poland is a land of great heroes.  (Applause.)  And you are a people who know the true value of what you defend. The triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war. For Americans, Poland has been a symbol of hope since the beginning of our nation.  Polish heroes and American patriots fought side by side in our War of Independence and in many wars that followed.  Our soldiers still serve together today in Afghanistan and Iraq, combatting the enemies of all civilization. For America\u2019s part, we have never given up on freedom and independence as the right and destiny of the Polish people, and we never, ever will.  (Applause.) Our two countries share a special bond forged by unique histories and national characters.  It\u2019s a fellowship that exists only among people who have fought and bled and died for freedom.  (Applause.) The signs of this friendship stand in our nation\u2019s capital.  Just steps from the White House, we\u2019ve raised statues of men with names like Pu\u0142aski and Ko\u015bciuszko.  (Applause.)  The same is true in Warsaw, where street signs carry the name of George Washington, and a monument stands to one of the world\u2019s greatest heroes, Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.) And so I am here today not just to visit an old ally, but to hold it up as an example for others who seek freedom and who wish to summon the courage and the will to defend our civilization.  (Applause.)  The story of Poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never, ever forgotten who they are.  (Applause) AUDIENCE:  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump! PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Such a great honor.  This is a nation more than one thousand years old.  Your borders were erased for more than a century and only restored just one century ago. In 1920, in the Miracle of Vistula, Poland stopped the Soviet army bent on European conquest.  (Applause.)  Then, 19 years later in 1939, you were invaded yet again, this time by Nazi Germany from the west and the Soviet Union from the east.  That\u2019s trouble.  That\u2019s tough. Under a double occupation the Polish people endured evils beyond description: the Katyn forest massacre, the occupations, the Holocaust, the Warsaw Ghetto and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the destruction of this beautiful capital city, and the deaths of nearly one in five Polish people.  A vibrant Jewish population \u2013 the largest in Europe \u2013 was reduced to almost nothing after the Nazis systematically murdered millions of Poland\u2019s Jewish citizens, along with countless others, during that brutal occupation. In the summer of 1944, the Nazi and Soviet armies were preparing for a terrible and bloody battle right here in Warsaw. Amid that hell on earth, the citizens of Poland rose up to defend their homeland.  I am deeply honored to be joined on stage today by veterans and heroes of the Warsaw Uprising.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  (Chanting.) PRESIDENT TRUMP:  What great spirit.  We salute your noble sacrifice and we pledge to always remember your fight for Poland and for freedom.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.) This monument reminds us that more than 150,000 Poles died during that desperate struggle to overthrow oppression. From the other side of the river, the Soviet armed forces stopped and waited.  They watched as the Nazis ruthlessly destroyed the city, viciously murdering men, women, and children.  They tried to destroy this nation forever by shattering its will to survive. Trump says election meddling 'could be Russia' but 'no one really knows for sure' But there is a courage and a strength deep in the Polish character that no one could destroy.  The Polish martyr, Bishop Michael Kozal, said it well:  \u201cMore horrifying than a defeat of arms is a collapse of the human spirit.\u201d Through four decades of communist rule, Poland and the other captive nations of Europe endured a brutal campaign to demolish freedom, your faith, your laws, your history, your identity \u2013 indeed the very essence of your culture and your humanity.  Yet, through it all, you never lost that spirit.  (Applause.)  Your oppressors tried to break you, but Poland could not be broken.  (Applause.) And when the day came on June 2nd, 1979, and one million Poles gathered around Victory Square for their very first mass with their Polish Pope, that day, every communist in Warsaw must have known that their oppressive system would soon come crashing down.  (Applause.)  They must have known it at the exact moment during Pope John Paul II\u2019s sermon when a million Polish men, women, and children suddenly raised their voices in a single prayer.  A million Polish people did not ask for wealth.  They did not ask for privilege.  Instead, one million Poles sang three simple words:  \u201cWe Want God.\u201d  (Applause.) In those words, the Polish people recalled the promise of a better future.  They found new courage to face down their oppressors, and they found the words to declare that Poland would be Poland once again. As I stand here today before this incredible crowd, this faithful nation, we can still hear those voices that echo through history.  Their message is as true today as ever.  The people of Poland, the people of America, and the people of Europe still cry out \u201cWe want God.\u201d  (Applause.) Together, with Pope John Paul II, the Poles reasserted their identity as a nation devoted to God.  And with that powerful declaration of who you are, you came to understand what to do and how to live.  You stood in solidarity against oppression, against a lawless secret police, against a cruel and wicked system that impoverished your cities and your souls.  And you won.  Poland prevailed.  Poland will always prevail.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump! PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  You were supported in that victory over communism by a strong alliance of free nations in the West that defied tyranny.  Now, among the most committed members of the NATO Alliance, Poland has resumed its place as a leading nation of a Europe that is strong, whole, and free. A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe, and they know that.  A strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.  (Applause.)  One hundred years after the entry of American forces into World War I, the transatlantic bond between the United States and Europe is as strong as ever and maybe, in many ways, even stronger. This continent no longer confronts the specter of communism.  But today we\u2019re in the West, and we have to say there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life.  You see what\u2019s happening out there.  They are threats.  We will confront them.  We will win.  But they are threats.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump! PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We are confronted by another oppressive ideology \u2013 one that seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe.  America and Europe have suffered one terror attack after another.  We\u2019re going to get it to stop.  (Applause.) During a historic gathering in Saudi Arabia, I called on the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations to join together to drive out this menace which threatens all of humanity.  We must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of their territory and their funding, and their networks, and any form of ideological support that they may have.  While we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump! PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We are fighting hard against radical Islamic terrorism, and we will prevail.  We cannot accept those who reject our values and who use hatred to justify violence against the innocent. Today, the West is also confronted by the powers that seek to test our will, undermine our confidence, and challenge our interests.  To meet new forms of aggression, including propaganda, financial crimes, and cyberwarfare, we must adapt our alliance to compete effectively in new ways and on all new battlefields. We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, and its support for hostile regimes \u2013 including Syria and Iran \u2013 and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself.  (Applause.) Finally, on both sides of the Atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger \u2013 one firmly within our control.  This danger is invisible to some but familiar to the Poles:  the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.  The West became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies. Americans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty.  We must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.  (Applause.)  If left unchecked, these forces will undermine our courage, sap our spirit, and weaken our will to defend ourselves and our societies. But just as our adversaries and enemies of the past learned here in Poland, we know that these forces, too, are doomed to fail if we want them to fail.  And we do, indeed, want them to fail.  (Applause.)  They are doomed not only because our alliance is strong, our countries are resilient, and our power is unmatched.  Through all of that, you have to say everything is true.  Our adversaries, however, are doomed because we will never forget who we are.  And if we don\u2019t forget who are, we just can\u2019t be beaten.  Americans will never forget.  The nations of Europe will never forget.  We are the fastest and the greatest community.  There is nothing like our community of nations.  The world has never known anything like our community of nations. We write symphonies.  We pursue innovation.  We celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover brand-new frontiers. We reward brilliance.  We strive for excellence, and cherish inspiring works of art that honor God.  We treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech and free expression.  (Applause.) We empower women as pillars of our society and of our success.  We put faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, at the center of our lives.  And we debate everything.  We challenge everything.  We seek to know everything so that we can better know ourselves.  (Applause.) And above all, we value the dignity of every human life, protect the rights of every person, and share the hope of every soul to live in freedom.  That is who we are.  Those are the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization. What we have, what we inherited from our \u2013 and you know this better than anybody, and you see it today with this incredible group of people \u2013 what we\u2019ve inherited from our ancestors has never existed to this extent before.  And if we fail to preserve it, it will never, ever exist again.  So we cannot fail. This great community of nations has something else in common:  In every one of them, it is the people, not the powerful, who have always formed the foundation of freedom and the cornerstone of our defense.  The people have been that foundation here in Poland \u2013 as they were right here in Warsaw \u2013 and they were the foundation from the very, very beginning in America. Our citizens did not win freedom together, did not survive horrors together, did not face down evil together, only to lose our freedom to a lack of pride and confidence in our values.  We did not and we will not.  We will never back down.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump! PRESIDENT TRUMP:  As long as we know our history, we will know how to build our future.  Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests.  That is why my administration has demanded that all members of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligation. As a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO.  In fact, people are shocked.  But billions and billions of dollars more are coming in from countries that, in my opinion, would not have been paying so quickly. To those who would criticize our tough stance, I would point out that the United States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment.  (Applause.) Words are easy, but actions are what matters.  And for its own protection \u2013 and you know this, everybody knows this, everybody has to know this \u2013 Europe must do more.  Europe must demonstrate that it believes in its future by investing its money to secure that future. That is why we applaud Poland for its decision to move forward this week on acquiring from the United States the battle-tested Patriot air and missile defense system \u2013 the best anywhere in the world.  (Applause.)  That is also why we salute the Polish people for being one of the NATO countries that has actually achieved the benchmark for investment in our common defense.  Thank you.  Thank you, Poland.  I must tell you, the example you set is truly magnificent, and we applaud Poland.  Thank you.  (Applause.) We have to remember that our defense is not just a commitment of money, it is a commitment of will.  Because as the Polish experience reminds us, the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have.  The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.  Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost?  Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders?  Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?  (Applause.) We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on Earth, but if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive.  (Applause.)  If anyone forgets the critical importance of these things, let them come to one country that never has.  Let them come to Poland.  (Applause.)  And let them come here, to Warsaw, and learn the story of the Warsaw Uprising. Donald Trump just defined what being 'modern day presidential' president looks like When they do, they should learn about Jerusalem Avenue.  In August of 1944, Jerusalem Avenue was one of the main roads running east and west through this city, just as it is today. Control of that road was crucially important to both sides in the battle for Warsaw.  The German military wanted it as their most direct route to move troops and to form a very strong front.  And for the Polish Home Army, the ability to pass north and south across that street was critical to keep the center of the city, and the Uprising itself, from being split apart and destroyed. Every night, the Poles put up sandbags amid machine gun fire \u2013 and it was horrendous fire \u2013 to protect a narrow passage across Jerusalem Avenue.  Every day, the enemy forces knocked them down again and again and again.  Then the Poles dug a trench.  Finally, they built a barricade.  And the brave Polish fighters began to flow across Jerusalem Avenue.  That narrow passageway, just a few feet wide, was the fragile link that kept the Uprising alive. Between its walls, a constant stream of citizens and freedom fighters made their perilous, just perilous, sprints.  They ran across that street, they ran through that street, they ran under that street \u2013 all to defend this city.  \u201cThe far side was several yards away,\u201d recalled one young Polish woman named Greta.  That mortality and that life was so important to her.  In fact, she said, \u201cThe mortally dangerous sector of the street was soaked in the blood.  It was the blood of messengers, liaison girls, and couriers.\u201d Nazi snipers shot at anybody who crossed.  Anybody who crossed, they were being shot at.  Their soldiers burned every building on the street, and they used the Poles as human shields for their tanks in their effort to capture Jerusalem Avenue.  The enemy never ceased its relentless assault on that small outpost of civilization.  And the Poles never ceased its defense. The Jerusalem Avenue passage required constant protection, repair, and reinforcement, but the will of its defenders did not waver, even in the face of death.  And to the last days of the Uprising, the fragile crossing never, ever failed.  It was never, ever forgotten.  It was kept open by the Polish people. The memories of those who perished in the Warsaw Uprising cry out across the decades, and few are clearer than the memories of those who died to build and defend the Jerusalem Avenue crossing.  Those heroes remind us that the West was saved with the blood of patriots; that each generation must rise up and play their part in its defense \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and that every foot of ground, and every last inch of civilization, is worth defending with your life. Our own fight for the West does not begin on the battlefield \u2013 it begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls.  Today, the ties that unite our civilization are no less vital, and demand no less defense, than that bare shred of land on which the hope of Poland once totally rested.  Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory. And today as ever, Poland is in our heart, and its people are in that fight.  (Applause.)  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.  Our values will prevail.  Our people will thrive.  And our civilization will triumph.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump!  Donald Trump! PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  So, together, let us all fight like the Poles \u2013 for family, for freedom, for country, and for God. Thank you.  God Bless You.  God bless the Polish people.  God bless our allies.  And God bless the United States of America. Thank you.  God bless you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",

Cory Booker hosted a Facebook live, proof he shines on social media Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Add another major 2020 Democratic player to the list of supporters of single-payer health insurance: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. \u201cYes,\u201d the New York senator does support single-payer, her senior adviser Glen Caplin told me. Gillibrand first seemed to endorse the idea on the steps outside the Capitol this week, in a Facebook Live hosted by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. \u201cHealth care should be a right, it should never be a privilege. We should have Medicare for all in this country,\u201d she said. However, Gillibrand in the past hasn\u2019t used the phrase \u201cMedicare for all\u201d as a substitute for \u201csingle-payer\u201d the same way Bernie Sanders does. Instead, as Caplin pointed out, \u201csince she first ran for Congress in 2006 in a red district, Kirsten has been advocating for \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 where anyone can buy into Medicare for a price they can afford\u201d \u2014 that is, by paying a fixed percentage of their income. That all begged the follow-up: Does Gillibrand support single-payer? Her senior adviser\u2019s answer \u2014 \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 to that question is a major development for Gillibrand. It positions her with Sanders, progressive activists, and as of this week, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who told The Wall Street Journal that on health care, \u201cnow it\u2019s time for the next step. And the next step is single-payer.\u201d Per the Pew Research Center, 52% of Democrats support single-payer. Democrats generally want to set aside the topic of single-payer while they are fighting President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But for the 2020 Democratic presidential race, embracing it increasingly seems to be the price of admission into the upper tier. What we\u2019re watching: Which Democratic senators will sign on as cosponsors when Sanders filed his single-payer bill? That bill is expected to drop after the Senate Republican push to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic legislation reaches its conclusion. Booker\u2019s Facebook Live: That Cory Booker Facebook Live started with just the New Jersey senator and Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon. But more and more Democrats joined them outside the Capitol, and it wound up going more than three hours. The episode was a reminder that Booker \u2014 a pioneer on political Twitter as Newark mayor \u2014 has a magnetic personality that shines through on social media in a way other 2020 prospects might struggle to match. \u2014 Booker\u2019s ties to Wall Street are too close for many progressives\u2019 comfort \u2014 and sometimes, as in his refusal to join most Democrats in calling for a full repeal of Jared Kushner\u2019s security clearance, he plays it safe. But as one Democratic operative put it: \u201cI don\u2019t think litmus tests are going to matter as much as energy and authenticity and Booker has both. \u2026 People find him personally compelling. You can\u2019t beat that with a policy critique and that was proven out again on this livestream this week.\u201d \u2014 Booker also wrote a letter to the editor of The Washington Post rebutting Attorney General Jeff Sessions on criminal sentencing for drug users, accusing Sessions of \u201cusing the politics of fear.\u201d The Senate\u2019s \u201cno\u201d caucus: Booker, Gillibrand and others, including Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, have said they don\u2019t want to run for president. OK \u2026 but should we believe them? I asked some smart Democrats, and most said they really do believe Franken won\u2019t run. As for the rest \u2014 and any other top-level Democrat \u2014 it\u2019s particularly dangerous at this stage to be seen as fighting for yourself, rather than against Trump. Biden the lifeguard: Former Vice President Joe Biden visited a Delaware pool Monday where years ago he was the only white lifeguard as a child. The pool is being renamed after him \u2014 and Biden also used the visit to make a statement about race and poverty. He said when he worked there, the other lifeguards would \u201cask me questions \u2014 because I really was the only white guy they really knew \u2014 about things that just startled me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI remember one lifeguard asked if I had a five-gallon can for gasoline. I said \u2018No, I don\u2019t. But what do you need it for?\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m going down to see my grandmom in North Carolina. We can\u2019t stop at most gas stations. They won\u2019t let us stop at most gas stations.\u2019 I learned a lot.\u201d \u2014 Joe and Jill Biden also launched Monday the new Biden Cancer Initiative, a private venture meant to work in tandem with Biden\u2019s \u201cMoonshot\u201d program. Warren\u2019s advice: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren gave a bit of a pep talk to Samantha Bee this week, telling her that the way to respond to Trump\u2019s presidency is to fight. \u201cIt means that when you\u2019re told to be quiet, you don\u2019t sit down and be quiet,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou stand back up.\u201d The line shows Warren is still leaning on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s admonishment earlier this year. \u2014 Warren directly courted CEOs on health care in a Forbes op-ed, writing that \u201ca cold look at the bottom line should be enough to make the business case for preserving the gains achieved by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d \u2014 There\u2019s a new super PAC called \u201cDeal Her Out\u201d focused on defeating Warren in her 2018 re-election bid. Murphy gets a challenger: Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy got his first challenger headed into the 2018 midterms: Dominic Rapini, a Branford businessman who was inspired by Trump\u2019s win. The \u201cstars\u201d of 2020: Speaking of New Hampshire, the Concord Monitor named Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban, Starbucks founder Howard Schultz, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and actor Tom Hanks among the Democratic 2020 prospects, extending an invitation to meet with its editorial board to all of them. (We\u2019ve heard Schultz is the one to watch in that group.) \u2014 Monday, July 3: California Sen. Kamala Harris will speak at a citizenship ceremony for 41 children and young people from 14 countries. They will be sworn in as US citizens aboard the USS Iowa in San Pedro at 9:15 a.m. PT. She\u2019ll also attend a health care rally an hour later in Torrance organized by the SEIU and the #Fight4OurHealth coalition, and then a roundtable on health care at 2:45 p.m. PT in San Francisco. \u2014 Thursday, July 6: We talked last week about Jason Kander\u2019s visit to Iowa. On July 6, he\u2019s headed to New Hampshire, where he\u2019ll deliver Gov. Chris Sununu a petition opposing a Republican bill that tightens voting and registration requirements there. \u2014 Friday, July 7: A Republican event to watch: Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a prominent Trump critic, will speak at a Story County, Iowa, GOP dinner at 6 p.m. CT. Iowa Republican chairman Jeff Kaufmann recently lambasted Sasse for his Trump criticism, saying: \u201cYou know what Sen. Sasse, I really don\u2019t care what you like \u2014 we love Donald Trump! And if you don\u2019t love him, I\u2019d suggest you stay on your side of the Missouri River.\u201d Notes from CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg: Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, one of Bernie Sanders\u2019 top surrogates during the 2016 primary contest, is the new president of \u201cOur Revolution,\u201d the political organization spawned by his campaign. She replaces former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver. Why does it matter? Our Revolution owns the vaunted Sanders email list. But its influence \u2014 so far \u2014 has not matched its founding promise. If it\u2019s going to be a player in 2020, it needs to back (and attract) winners in 2018. Turner\u2019s new job is a nod to that. As board chair Larry Cohen told me in a text message last night, \u201cOur strategy is very much based on building the membership in our hundreds of groups that focus on issues, candidates and party building and the connections between the three. This is much harder work than simply fighting Trump.\u201d Translation: Turner, an electric speaker and beloved on the progressive left, can fire up the grassroots in a way that Weaver, who rankled the younger, digital-native Sanders campaign vets (a number of whom resigned when he was appointed last year), could not. So does this mean Turner\u2019s potential run for Ohio governor is dead? Online groups have been agitating for her to run. A spokeswoman would only say (twice) that Turner \u201chas not made a statement\u201d on the matter. California Sen. Kamala Harris took her opposition to the Senate GOP health care bill to Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cLenny Letter\u201d newsletter. \u2026 Howard Stern has a \u201cman crush\u201d on a Minnesota senator. \u201cI would be gay with Al Franken, if I was a gay man,\u201d he said on his show. CNN\u2019s Sophie Tatum, Ashley Killough, Miranda Green, Saba Hamedy and Betsy Klein contributed to this memo.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave several answers on his meetings with Russian officials Senators proved despite the end of Tuesday's hearing they're not quite done with Sessions Attorney General Jeff Sessions captivated Washington Tuesday, beating back rumors of a private meeting with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US and mounting a defense for President Donald Trump, one week after former FBI Director James Comey artfully unloaded on both men. Sessions routinely said he would not answer questions regarding his conversations with Trump, but he delivered more than enough answers over two and a half hours of testimony Tuesday afternoon. Here are the top five things we learned. Sessions had one major goal \u2013 to protect himself after Comey thrust him into the center of the Russia maelstrom. And he appeared to do that effectively in a strong opening statement, where he slammed the door shut on even the possibility that he had a third meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \u201cI did not have any private meetings, nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event separate,\u201d Sessions said. But in the rat-a-tat-tat of follow-up questions, Sessions slowly pried that door open again, by increasingly hedging his answers. Once again, senators try to cut off Kamala Harris Shortly after his opening, Sessions said that if he had talked with Kislyak, \u201cIt would\u2019ve been certainly, I can assure you, nothing improper, if I\u2019d had a conversation with him. And it\u2019s conceivable that that occurred. I just don\u2019t remember it.\u201d Later, under an intense grilling from Sen. Kamala Harris \u2013 which earned a rebuke from Sen. John McCain \u2013 Sessions explained his hedging. \u201cWill you let me qualify it? If I don\u2019t qualify it you\u2019ll accuse me of lying. So, I need to be correct as best I can,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast, it makes me nervous.\u201d The chief law enforcement officer of the United States was never briefed on Russia\u2019s hacking of one of its major political parties, or any other efforts by Russia to mess with the elections \u2013 past and future. Why? Because he personally recused himself from all things related to the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia the day after he was sworn into office. What Sessions didn\u2019t explain is why he waited a month to tell the public \u2013 and his own associates \u2013 that he had stepped aside from the probe. Comey testified last week that as of February 14, he still believed Sessions had not recused himself \u2013 but that he almost certainly would. In fact, according to Sessions, he had recused himself two weeks earlier. Also, he\u2019s not 100% sure that Russia messed with the election, because he\u2019s only read news reports about it. It\u2019s not clear if Sessions intended to pay penance to Trump after their relationship strained over the President\u2019s concerns that Sessions burned him by stepping aside from the Russia probe \u2013 but he did a good job defending the White House anyway. Sessions is now the only Trump official on the record, under oath, countering Comey\u2019s testimony last week under oath. In particular, Sessions tamped down Comey\u2019s recounting of the February 14 meeting Comey had with Trump \u2013 where Trump reportedly asked him stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. READ: James Comey\u2019s prepared testimony First, Sessions discounted Comey\u2019s report that Sessions didn\u2019t want to leave the room because he felt like something might be amiss. \u201cI left. It didn\u2019t seem to me to be a major problem. I knew that Director Comey, long-time experienced in the Department of Justice, could handle himself well,\u201d Sessions told Sen. Marco Rubio. Then Sessions downplayed Comey\u2019s request that he never be left in the room alone with Trump again, saying, \u201che gave me no detail about what it was that he was concerned about.\u201d Later, Sessions directly blasted Comey for his testimony in private last week, \u201cThis is a secret innuendo out there being leaked about me \u2013 and I don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d The White House said Trump thinks Sessions \u201cdid a very good job\u201d in his testimony. In the gaggle on Air Force One on Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said the President wasn\u2019t able to watch \u201cmuch of it,\u201d but from \u201cwhat he did see and what he heard, he thought that attorney general Sessions did a very good job and in particular was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\u201d Sanders confirmed that the President did interview Robert Mueller as a candidate for FBI director the day before he was named special counsel of the federal investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia ties. Sanders would not, however, say whether the President has confidence in Mueller in that role. \u201cBeyond that, what I said earlier, I don\u2019t have anything more to add,\u201d Sanders said, when a reporter asked if Trump has confidence in Mueller. When Comey testified, there was nobody carrying water for the White House on the Senate Russia probe \u2013 even though half of the panel is comprised of Senate Republicans. But that changed Tuesday, with a variety of Republicans coming to Sessions\u2019 (and the White House\u2019s) aide. Winners and losers from Jeff Sessions' testimony on Russia It could be because they didn\u2019t like seeing one of their former colleagues \u2013 Sessions was in the Senate 20 years \u2013 under the hot glare of the national spotlight. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who has frequently supported Trump and worked with Sessions when he was in the Senate, offered him a hand, painting a comical portrait of an alleged spy scheme. \u201cHave you ever, ever in any of these fantastical situations heard of a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage?\u201d An apparent fracture on the committee even emerged when, after Chairman Richard Burr said they were intensely focused on Russian interference in the election, Sen. Jim Risch muttered, \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d Warner made clear in his opening remarks they were already planning to bring Sessions in for questioning later this year, well before Sessions offered to appear before them. And lawmakers throughout the hearing pressed Sessions on providing emails and other documents to them. What\u2019s not clear is if Trump will be forced to invoke executive privilege to stop Sessions from testifying again, or from handing over the documents senators requested Tuesday. Sessions cited a Justice Department policy which blocks officials from testifying about private discussions with the President. (Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, later noted that former Attorney General Eric Holder used that policy to stall Congress\u2019 investigations of the Obama White House.) Burr made it clear Tuesday that National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers followed through on his promise to the Senate intelligence committee and returned to answer questions in private that he said he could not answer. Sessions would not make that promise Tuesday. But lawmakers aren\u2019t done with him yet. CNN\u2019s Liz Landers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sessions' appearance is an intriguing sequel to Comey's bombshell-laden testimony Meetings with Russian ambassador under microscope Attorney General Jeff Sessions infuriated Democratic senators Tuesday by repeatedly thwarting their efforts to shed light on the firing of James Comey, as he blasted secret innuendo and leaks over his own conduct. In a fiery Senate intelligence committee hearing, Sessions raised his voice in indignation as he rejected claims that he had colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election as an \u201cappalling and detestable lie.\u201d He repeatedly declined to go into his private conversations with President Donald Trump \u2013 frustrating Democrats who accused him of \u201cstonewalling\u201d to shield the administration. Using all the skills in filibustering and diversion that he learned in years as an Alabama senator, the Attorney General appeared to escape the hearing without major political damage. He also provided resistance that may offer a boost to a crisis-weary White House that has been unable to shrug off the dark cloud over the Russia investigation. Sessions beseeched his former Senate colleagues to believe him when he said he did not hold an undisclosed meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a speech by then-candidate Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington last year. He said he could not recall if he had an informal interactions with Russians at the event. Sessions defended his decision to participate in the firing of former FBI Director Comey, even though he had recused himself from the Russian matter and Trump later said that the probe was in his mind when he pushed the FBI chief overboard. \u201cI recused myself from any investigation into the campaign for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations,\u201d he said. But the attorney general left Democratic senators deeply frustrated when he declined to go into the reasons for Comey\u2019s dismissal and wouldn\u2019t say whether the President ordered him out of the Oval Office so he could talk privately with Comey on February 14, in an encounter the former FBI director said included a request for him to go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn. When asked by Sen. Angus King if the President invoked executive privilege to prevent his testimony, Sessions responded, \u201cI am protecting the right of the President to assert it if he chooses; and there may be other privileges that could apply in this circumstance.\u201d Trump watched Sessions testify aboard Air Force One during about 90-minute flight to Milwaukee, an aide told CNN. After the hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee suggested to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that Congress could ultimately be prepared to hold Sessions in contempt of Congress in an effort to force him to testify in more detail. Sessions\u2019 responses triggered an explosion by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. \u201cI believe the American people have had it with stonewalling,\u201d Wyden said. Sessions replied, \u201cI am not stonewalling. I\u2019m following historic policies of Department of Justice. You don\u2019t walk into any committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with president of United States.\u201d When Wyden accused him of not answering the questions about Comey\u2019s reported remark that his behavior after recusing himself from the Russia probe was \u201cproblematic,\u201d Sessions chuckled and then launched into his most theatrical defense of his actions. \u201cThis is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me, and I don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d Sessions said, raising his voice. Other Democrats also lost their patience with Sessions. \u201cYou are not answering questions. You are impeding this investigation,\u201d said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich. And California Sen. Dianne Feinstein appeared puzzled by Sessions\u2019 reasoning for not providing more details. Sessions said that he was not sure what was \u201cexplicitly\u201d in Trump\u2019s mind when he decided to fire Comey. But he said that he was unable to say whether he had discussed Comey\u2019s handling of the FBI investigation on the principle that his conversations with the President should be kept confidential. Feinstein then asked, \u201cHow do you view that? Since you discussed his removal, why wouldn\u2019t you discuss the reasons?\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris meanwhile again earned a rebuke from committee chairman Burr after interrupting Sessions as he was trying to answer, and the Attorney General played the exchange for all it was worth. \u201cI\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast, it makes me nervous,\u201d Sessions said. Sessions\u2019 determination to mount a vigorous rebuttal, after Comey\u2019s testimony before the committee last week raised questions about the administration\u2019s conduct, was clear from the moment he began his opening statement. He said he did not recall a third meeting with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak in the Mayflower hotel in Washington, despite reports that the FBI had been investigating whether such a contact took place. \u201cI did not have any private meetings nor recall any private conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower Hotel,\u201d  Sessions told the Senate intelligence committee. Sessions also argued that his recusal from the Russia investigation did not mean that he should be barred from his oversight duties over the FBI, following claims by Democrats that he should have not played a role in Comey\u2019s firing. \u201cI recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAt all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming attorney general, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards.\u201d Sessions confirmed that he had left Comey on his own with Trump in the Oval Office alone on February 14, though declined to say whether he was ordered to do so by the President citing the need to keep his conversations with him private. He also confirmed Comey\u2019s testimony that the former FBI chief later told him he was concerned about the meeting, but said he did not say that something improper occurred. Sessions also testified that he had never had any meetings with officials from Russia or anywhere else about interference in the US election. \u201cFurther, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThe suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.\u201d Sessions said he had confidence in special counsel Robert Mueller, and said that his recusal from the Russia probe would stop him taking part in any hypothetical effort to remove him. A friend of Trump\u2019s said Monday that the President was considering taking just such a step. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jeff Sessions appeared before the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday The White House had previously suggested Sessions could invoke executive privilege during his testimony Sessions did not ask the White House about whether Trump was invoking executive privilege Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday avoided answering a handful of questions during his hearing before the Senate intelligence committee \u2013 but sought to explicitly avoid saying he is invoking \u201cexecutive privilege.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not claiming executive privilege, because that\u2019s the President\u2019s power,\u201d Sessions told Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. Instead, Sessions repeatedly said he is \u201cnot able to comment\u201d or \u201cnot able to discuss\u201d certain topics, citing either Justice Department \u201clongstanding policy,\u201d and later, that he is protecting President Donald Trump\u2019s right to later on assert executive privilege \u201cif he chooses.\u201d Democrats were unhappy with Sessions declining to testify about his discussions with Trump, citing the longstanding policy. In a statement issued following the hearing, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on a subcommittee of the Judiciary panel, said: \u201cAs someone who served in the Department of Justice, I would love to know what he is talking about.\u201d Jeff Sessions: Russia collusion claim 'detestable lie' Sessions\u2019 hearing marked the first time the attorney general had testified before Congress since he recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election, and since the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Sessions did not ask the White House about whether Trump was invoking executive privilege over his testimony and Trump did not opt to assert the privilege, a senior administration official said Tuesday. But the same official argued claiming privilege on a hearing without knowing the scope would not comply with \u201chow the process works.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask,\u201d the official said, \u201cbut going into a hearing and saying we are going to do this ahead of time is not how the process works.\u201d As expected, lawmakers grilled Sessions about his role in Comey\u2019s firing, his own involvement in the Trump campaign and his meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US. When asked by Sen. Dianne Feinstein about whether he spoke with President Donald Trump about Comey\u2019s firing, Sessions said: \u201cI\u2019m not able to discuss or confirm or deny the nature of private conversations that I may have had with the president on this subject or others.\u201d He again cited a Justice Department rule. Trump's friend Christopher Ruddy says President considering firing Mueller \u201cI know how this will be discussed, but that\u2019s the rule that\u2019s been long adhered to by Department of Justice, as you know, Sen. Feinstein.\u201d The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for the DOJ policy Sessions cited during the hearing. When asked whether this DOJ custom had a written source, a DOJ official pointed CNN to two 1982 memoranda. \u201cDeclining to answer questions at a congressional hearing about confidential conversations with the President is long-standing executive-branch-wide practice,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe basis for this historical practice is laid out in the 1982 memos from President Reagan and then-Assistant Attorney General Olson.\u201d Sessions time and again Tuesday pointed broadly to historical Justice practices to explain his decision not to answer. \u201cI am not stonewalling,\u201d Sessions told Sen. Ron Wyden. \u201cI\u2019m following historic policies of Department of Justice. You don\u2019t walk into any committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with President of United States.\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, said Sessions\u2019 \u201csilence speaks volumes.\u201d \u201cYou said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth,\u201d Heinrich told Sessions. \u201cNow you\u2019re not answering questions. You are impeding this investigation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not able to invoke executive privilege, that\u2019s the President\u2019s prerogative,\u201d Sessions reiterated. \u201cThat\u2019s my judgment that it would be inappropriate for me to answer and reveal private conversations with the president when he has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer,\u201d Sessions said. This was among the many times Sessions attempted to explain that he is protecting the President\u2019s right to choose to invoke executive privilege in not sharing the details of conversations. Sessions, Wyden scrap over AG's 'problematic' role \u201cThere is no legally binding basis for refusing to answer questions unrelated to an ongoing investigation unless the President is invoking executive privilege,\u201d William Yeomans, a 26-year veteran of the Justice Department and fellow at American University Law School, told CNN.\u201dThat privilege is not absolute \u2013 it can be overcome by a sufficient interest. DOJ traditionally does not discuss ongoing investigations in public, but ultimately must answer questions unless executive privilege is properly invoked and upheld.\u201d The committee can hold Sessions in contempt when he doesn\u2019t answer questions \u2013 but that could elongate the testimony and could potentially take months. The committee can also work with the Trump administration to come up with a solution. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that conversations that involve national security in a real sense are potentially protected by an executive privilege,\u201d Diane Marie Amann, a law professor at University of Georgia, told CNN Monday. \u201cBut some of the areas that have been under discussion, with regard to confidential communications, are not classified \u2013 and don\u2019t implicate national security. That\u2019s much more of a gray area.\u201d Sessions said during his hearing he is not sure if he would be able to answer the questions in a closed session.

The hearing will be focused on Sessions\u2019 involvement in the Trump campaign and his meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US. This will be the first time Sessions has testified before Congress since he recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Here\u2019s how to stay up to date and watch it on CNN. Sessions is set to testify in an open session of the Senate intelligence committee starting at 2:30 p.m. ET. The hearing comes on the heels of two canceled appearances, with Sessions citing Comey\u2019s testimony last week. Comey told the intelligence committee in a closed session that Sessions may have had a third, undisclosed interaction with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US, according to people familiar with the briefing. As late as Sunday, the Justice Department signaled it expected Sessions\u2019 testimony to be closed, but the final decision was up to the committee \u2013 with the Justice Department ultimately agreeing to a public hearing. Officials said this was in an effort to show there\u2019s nothing to hide and nothing controversial about Sessions\u2019 interactions with Russian officials. However, Sessions could invoke executive privilege during his testimony depending on \u201cthe scope of the questions,\u201d the White House suggested on Monday. Beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET, live coverage of the testimony will be streaming on CNN, CNN.com, the CNN app on phone and tablet, and on mobile devices.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify in public Tuesday On Monday, the White House did not rule out the possibility of Sessions invoking executive privilege at some point during his testimony. \u201cIt depends on the scope of the questions,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cTo get into a hypothetical at this point would be premature.\u201d But is that legal? Technically yes, according to a handful of legal experts. Diane Marie Amann, a law professor at University of Georgia, agreed with Spicer that invoking privilege was possible: \u201cIt depends on the questions that are asked,\u201d she said. This will be the first time Sessions has testified in Congress since he recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election, and since the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Questions have arisen about Sessions\u2019 role in Comey\u2019s firing, his own involvement in the Trump campaign and his meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that conversations that involve national security in a real sense are potentially protected by an executive privilege,\u201d Amann said. \u201cBut some of the areas that have been under discussion, with regard to confidential communications, are not classified \u2013 and don\u2019t implicate national security. That\u2019s much more of a gray area.\u201d If Sessions chooses to opt out of answering certain questions, legal experts say the committee can hold him in contempt \u2013 but that could elongate the testimony and could potentially take months. \u201cIf they choose to do so, that could lead to litigation in court about whether the privilege exists and whether its applies in the instance that he invoked it,\u201d Amann said. Boxed in: Trump felt no choice but to keep Sessions The committee can also work with the Trump administration to come up with a solution. \u201cThe Committee can negotiate with the Administration to get answers to narrower or different questions or to get answers in a closed session,\u201d Lisa Kern Griffin, a professor at Duke University School of Law, told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIf they do not come to any agreement, of course the matter could be litigated.\u00a0The Supreme Court case that describes the scope of executive privilege arose from a similar dispute concerning the Nixon tapes.\u201d Discussions with the attorney general on topics within the scope of the President\u2019s constitutional duties ordinarily would be protected, lawyers say. What Sessions will and won\u2019t choose to answer \u201cis up to him,\u201d CNN\u2019s senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin told Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Monday. \u201cIf Jeff Sessions refuses to answer questions tomorrow, he\u2019s going to refuse to answer questions tomorrow,\u201d Toobin said. \u201cIt\u2019s really under Sessions\u2019 control tomorrow which questions he wants to answer.\u201d Still, for Sessions, there\u2019s a great deal at stake politically with this testimony. Reports last week suggested Sessions offered his resignation to Trump because the President blamed Sessions for exacerbating his Russia problems by recusing himself from the probe. \u201cThe peril to Sessions is a great deal more regarding those conversations with the Russians because he made sworn statements on his security clearances that appear to be contradictory to his actual record with contact with Russians,\u201d Toobin said. \u201cThat relates to his personal liability. That\u2019s what I think he\u2019s going to be considerably worried about. He\u2019s going to have some explanation, we\u2019ll see if people find it credible.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom LoBianco, Manu Raju and Laura Jarrett contributed to this report.",

According to sources familiar with the closed briefing, former FBI director James Comey said Sessions may have met with Kislyak a third time.

            "article_content": "Wray has never worked at the FBI, but previously served as a top official at the Justice Department Wray currently works as a white-collar defense attorney In nominating Christopher Wray to be the next FBI chief, President Donald Trump immediately thrust a low-profile white collar defense lawyer into the public spotlight. Wray\u2019s credentials are classic establishment: a Yale Law School graduate and executive editor of the law review, law clerk to a conservative federal judge, longtime federal prosecutor for decades and top official in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. He currently works at King & Spalding as a litigation partner, specializing in the defense of individuals and corporations in white-collar criminal cases \u2013 and even represented New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie during the \u201cBridgegate\u201d investigation into lane closures at the George Washington Bridge. Trump to nominate Christopher Wray as FBI director \u201cThe President asked us to look for an FBI director who has integrity, who understands and is committed to the rule of law, and who is dedicated to protecting the American people from crime, gangs, and terrorists,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe have found our man in Chris Wray.\u201d And while Wray was never one of the more public-facing Trump supporters, he has given more than $50,000 to Republican candidates, committees, and his law firm\u2019s PAC since 2007, including to John McCain in 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012 and the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2016, Federal Election Commission records show. Within hours of Trump\u2019s announcement, others who had been under consideration for the job praised the choice. \u201cChris Wray is super smart, a great lawyer and highly experienced. He will serve the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation well,\u201d said former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Chris for a number of years and always had complete confidence in him. He simply doesn\u2019t make mistakes. We\u2019re very fortunate that he decided to re-enter public service.\u201d Wray first joined the Justice Department in 2001 under Bush, and as a young prosecutor, found himself in the midst of several tumultuous showdowns. In 2003, questions swirled on Capitol Hill as lawmakers learned that then-Attorney General John Ascroft\u2019s top aides were regularly briefing him on key details of the investigation into who revealed the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame and Democratic senators questioned whether Ashcroft had taken on more of a hands-on role than previously understood. And who was briefing Ashcroft? Christopher Wray \u2013 then a top official at the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. Warner: Trump's FBI announcement 'more than a little bit curious' He faced sharp questioning at a Senate judiciary committee hearing but maintained at the time that Ashcroft had been given all the \u201cdetails needed for him to understand meaningfully what\u2019s going on in the investigation.\u201d Less than a year later, Wray was reportedly among the top officials at the Justice Department \u2013 along with embattled former FBI Director James Comey and now special counsel Robert Mueller \u2013 who planned to resign after White House officials tried to persuade a hospitalized Ashcroft to sign off on a warrantless domestic surveillance program in 2004. Ashcroft praised Wray\u2019s nomination Wednesday. \u201cChris Wray is a man of integrity with a deep commitment to the rule of law,\u201d the former attorney general said in a statement. \u201cHis substantial experience, particularly in serving on our Justice Department team fighting terrorism after 9/11, uniquely qualifies him to protect America as FBI director.\u201d Other former colleagues universally applauded Wray on Wednesday. Harvard Law Professor Jack Goldsmith, who served as a top official at the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel when Wray was at the department \u2013 and has been a vocal critic of Trump \u2013 called Wray a \u201cmuch better choice\u201d than the other names floated to lead the FBI. \u201cWray is smart, serious, and professional. He doesn\u2019t have quite the range of experiences that his two predecessors did. But he has deep experience with federal criminal law and the FBI,\u201d wrote Goldsmith on Lawfare. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s firing of James Comey was a travesty. But Wray is a good choice, a much better choice than any of the politicians I previously saw floated, and a much better choice than I expected Trump to make. Without prejudging what will surely be a probing confirmation process, I think Wray is qualified to be director of the FBI.\u201d Alice Fisher, a partner at Latham & Watkins who was also one of the almost dozen interviewed last month to lead the FBI called Wray a \u201cwonderful choice.\u201d \u201cChris is a wonderful choice to lead the FBI who cares deeply about the institution and already has strong relationships with the FBI,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cHis background at the helm of the criminal division offered an excellent experience working on national security, white collar crime and a range of federal crimes as well as offering the privilege of working with the fantastic men and women of the FBI every day. He\u2019s an excellent lawyer who will provide even keeled leadership. CNN\u2019s Curt Devine and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Wednesday's hearing was slated five weeks ago but the guest list has high profile witnesses Scheduled to speak: Dan Coats, Mike Rogers, Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein The Senate intelligence committee is back in the national spotlight for two days of blockbuster hearings and following news that relations between President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions had reached a boiling point surrounding his recusal from the Justice Department\u2019s Russia investigation. Before Senate investigators probe former FBI Director James Comey, they will press four intelligence officials Wednesday in a hearing that on any other week would be the biggest event on Capitol Hill. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will all testify before the Senate intelligence committee 24 hours before the Comey hearing. Ahead of Comey testimony, Republicans prep response efforts -- and brace The event was scheduled five weeks ago as a review of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, but it quickly morphed into another chance for lawmakers to get some answers on the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian meddling in the US election. The hearing also comes the morning after news broke that Trump and Sessions have had a series of heated exchanges in the last several weeks, after Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, according to a source close to Sessions. Here are the five things to watch for Wednesday. Before senators get to questions on whether Trump pressured Comey to kill his investigation of former National Security Michael Flynn, they\u2019re going to dig in on whether Trump pressured Coats and Rogers to rebut Comey. According to The Washington Post, Trump pressed two of his top intelligence directors to argue that the FBI was not investigating ties between his campaign and Russian officials \u2013 one day after Comey revealed the investigation in public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. The Russia investigation: Everything you need to know The day after the report, Coats declined to answer whether it was true \u2013 but Coats also teased that he may be open to answering the question if asked by the right committee. \u201cIf I\u2019m called before an investigative committee, I certainly will provide them with what I know and what I don\u2019t know,\u201d Coats said on May 23. Sen. Mark Warner, the committee\u2019s vice chairman, said Wednesday it would be his first question of the hearing. The White House and its growing \u201cwar room\u201d may want to thank a 25-year-old NSA contractor named Reality Winner for becoming the first target of a leak investigation. Winner\u2019s alleged disclosure of an NSA report detailing Russian attempts to hack voting systems in the election, handed the Justice Department what appears to be an easy win. Trump has made identifying \u201cleakers\u201d one of his top priorities as part of an effort to counter Russia stories and the topic of Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2013 FISA surveillance \u2013 plays to Trump\u2019s strengths on this issue. (A Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday that McCabe would only answer questions about FISA, and not Russia.) But Winner\u2019s alleged leaking of the report is bound to give committee Republicans a stronger foothold to ask questions than the hearing topic or any of Trump\u2019s tweets. Opinion: The GOP wants to distract you with Reality Winner Just a day after Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as the special counsel for the Russia investigation, he headed to the Capitol for a pair of closed-door briefings about his decision. Second-hand reports of Rosenstein\u2019s promises and comments trickled out of the meetings, one in the House and one in the Senate, but Wednesday will mark the first time lawmakers can get Rosenstein on the record answering questions himself. Rosenstein has been intrinsically wrapped into the Comey firing story, with White House officials citing Rosenstein\u2019s memo as the key reason for Comey\u2019s ouster. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, has already promised to grill Rosenstein on what Trump told him when he said he wanted Comey fired. Who\u2019s who in the Trump-Russia saga Mueller might not be at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, but with Rosenstein and McCabe in the room, questions of how the federal and Senate investigations will co-exist are likely to come up. As of Tuesday, committee Chairman Richard Burr and Warner had still not talked to Mueller \u2013 three weeks after his appointment. How the James Comey hearing is Washington\u2019s Super Bowl Trump\u2019s surrogates may have said earlier this week that the President will not block Comey from testifying by claiming executive privilege. But all four of the officials testifying Wednesday still work for Trump, sparking some concern behind the scenes that Trump may try to curb their testimony. The White House did not respond to questions of whether Trump would claim executive privilege Wednesday. How to watch the James Comey testimony",

            "article_content": "Comey is scheduled to testify Thursday Trump fired him as FBI director last month The Russia maelstrom raging around Donald Trump\u2019s presidency reaches a momentous plot twist this week with a quintessential Washington drama set to unfold when ex-FBI Director James Comey testifies before the Senate. White House: Trump won't stop Comey from testifying Comey will appear before the Senate intelligence committee on Thursday, with lawmakers seeking answers as to whether he believes the President sought to obstruct his Russia probe or demanded his loyalty before he fired Comey. In a prelude to Thursday\u2019s theatrics, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday. Rosenstein wrote the memo that the White House used as the initial justification to fire Comey, and later called in a special counsel to take over the Russia investigation. The sessions represent a moment of immense risk for the White House and could counter its emphatic denials that Trump sought to influence the Russia probe or that there is any evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cClearly, it would be very, very troubling if the President of the United States is interfering in investigations that affect potentially the president and his closest associates,\u201d Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. Anticipation over Comey\u2019s appearance will return the administration to a state of siege, which has been partially lifted in recent weeks during Trump\u2019s foreign trip and the build up to his decision to quit the Paris climate pact. So pivotal is Comey\u2019s appearance to the Russia drama that there was intense speculation about whether Trump will seek to invoke executive privilege to block the former FBI chief\u2019s appearance and to keep their conversations private. White House 'war room' taking shape Monday, the White House confirmed it would opt not to do that. \u201cThe President\u2019s power to assert executive privilege is well-established. However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate intelligence committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey\u2019s scheduled testimony,\u201d said a statement issued by the White House. Seeking to block Comey\u2019s testimony could have amount to a grievous political misstep since it would instantly be seen as sign that the White House has something to hide. The crucial point at issue in Thursday\u2019s hearing will be whether Comey believes that the President sought to obstruct his investigation into alleged collusion between members of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia, at a time when Moscow was accused of interfering in the presidential election. Sources familiar with Comey\u2019s thinking told CNN last month that he now believes that Trump was trying to influence his judgment about the Russia investigation, during several conversations. But whether that influence amounts to an obstruction of justice amounts to an open question. Earlier in the month, sources told CNN that the President asked Comey to end the investigation into his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a request the then-FBI chief noted in a memo as he was so disturbed by it. Can Trump block Comey from testifying? White House could try to invoke executive privilege Comey was also \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Trump\u2019s request for a loyalty pledge at a dinner at the White House in late January, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper has reported. Democrats who argue that Trump has already behaved in a manner tantamount to obstructing justice meanwhile jumped on Trump\u2019s comment in an NBC interview in May that he was thinking of the Russia probe when he fired Comey. The Washington scandal machine went into overdrive when The New York Times reported that Trump had told a high-level Russian delegation in the Oval Office that Comey was a \u201cnut job\u201d and that firing him had eased \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him. Comey, who has a record of engineering theatrical political moments, is apparently keen to discuss his tense interactions with Trump. He has an incentive to put his side of the story, since the White House has publicly argued that he was not up to the job of leading the FBI since he was dismissed. \u201cPotentially, it\u2019s history depending on what Comey says,\u201d former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday. \u201cIf he says categorically, \u2018It is my conclusion that the President of the United States was trying to instruct my investigation,\u2019 full stop, that is historic. \u201c \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t say anything categorical, if he says, \u2018Well you know, I felt this way, it could have been otherwise\u2019 \u2026 if it is less than fully clear, then I think it gives both sides a lot of ammunition to argue through the rest of the summer and probably into the fall about what does all this mean.\u201d While Comey is expected to discuss his conversations with Trump, it is not clear how far he will feel constrained by the fact the interactions are also likely to form a key part of the special counsel investigation now being led by his predecessor as FBI director, Robert Mueller. He may also be unwilling to offer much clarity on the status of the Russia investigation itself up to the point of his departure from the FBI, given legal considerations and the fact that key evidence is likely to be classified. Senators on both sides will want to know whether Comey felt pressured by the President to close down the Russia investigation and will likely press him on reports that Trump demanded his loyalty. They will also certainly question the star witness on Trump\u2019s insistence \u2013 in a letter telling Comey of his dismissal \u2013 that he told the President on three occasions he was not being personally investigated. \u201cThat phrase raises a lot of questions in my mind,\u201d Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said on CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cDoes Mr. Comey agree that that is what was said? Why would he tell the president that? What was the tone and the context of those discussions on three different occasions, if they, in fact, are accurately portrayed in this letter?\u201d Should Comey deliver devastating testimony on any of those questions that suggests Trump obstructed justice, he will significantly worsen the political challenges facing the President. What was James Comey thinking when he met with Trump? \u201cIt becomes the testimony of one person,\u201d Zeldin said, \u201cone who will then become Robert Mueller\u2019s witness in the grand jury investigation in which they will determine whether or not obstruction occurred.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown, Jake Tapper, Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Michael Flynn resigned from President Donald Trump's White House earlier this year Ex-FBI Director James Comey said Trump asked him to end his investigation into Flynn The top two leaders of the Senate intelligence committee are leaving the door open to holding Michael Flynn in contempt of Congress after President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights rather than comply with a subpoena. Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the panel was reviewing a range of options to compel Flynn to disclose records about his meetings with Russian officials, including holding Flynn in contempt. And he said the panel \u201ccould\u201d call for Flynn to assert his right against self-incrimination in a public session. \u201cIt does us no good in having people pleading the Fifth if we are trying to get information,\u201d Burr said. He added: \u201cThe only thing I can tell you is immunity is off the table.\u201d Unlike Flynn, two other former Trump campaign officials have turned over documents to the committee related to its investigation of Russian meddling in the US election. \u201cThe subpoena seeks to compel (Flynn) to offer testimony through the act of producing documents that may or may not exist. In these circumstances, (Flynn) is entitled to, and does, invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against production of documents,\u201d Flynn\u2019s lawyer wrote in a letter to the committee, verified by CNN. When asked by CNN whether his panel would hold Flynn in contempt, Ranking Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner, said, \u201cWe have to find out whether we have the ability to either hold Gen. Flynn in contempt or whether it\u2019s just Fifth Amendment. I\u2019ve got to get the legal answer to that first.\u201d Warner said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d Flynn didn\u2019t produce the documents that were requested, and the committee was still determining if it had other options to get a hold of them. Flynn\u2019s refusal to cooperate comes as he faces scrutiny in several inquiries, including by Capitol Hill and a federal grand jury that has issued subpoenas to associates of the ex-national security adviser. His refusal will also intensify scrutiny over Trump\u2019s decision to hire him initially for the job and his decision to keep him on staff for 18 days after the President was warned by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Flynn may have been compromised by the Russians. And the White House is also bound to face new pressure from Trump\u2019s apparent disclosure of classified information in a private meeting with Russian officials at the White House earlier this month. Warner, in an interview with CNN on Monday, said the White House must turn over records related to that meeting \u2013 and did not rule out issuing a subpoena for the records. \u201cWe have made the request,\u201d Warner said. \u201cTranscripts or tapes. My hope is the White House will comply. They say there is no there there. They ought to work with the committee.\u201d Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has turned over documents to the committee, a source familiar with the filing told CNN on Monday. Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has also complied with the committee\u2019s requests and answered its questions, according to Stone\u2019s attorney, Robert Buschel. The Senate committee had asked Flynn earlier this month to produce all records over his communications with Russian officials by this Wednesday. But Flynn is expected to send a letter later Monday invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. The source close to Flynn said it would be \u201chighly imprudent for him not to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights\u201d given that several members of Congress have called for his prosecution. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: 'I believe we should look into obstruction of justice' Flynn\u2019s decision to decline the subpoena does not come as a surprise to Senate intelligence leaders, as Flynn\u2019s lawyer also told the panel last month he would not provide documents in response to an April request. Interactive: The many paths from Trump to RussiaFlynn was back in the news last week following the revelation that former FBI Director James Comey wrote in a memo that Trump had asked Comey in a meeting to end his investigation into the former national security adviser. Comey has agreed to testify before the Senate intelligence panel after Memorial Day. Warner said he and Burr hoped to meet with Robert Mueller, the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel in the Russia investigation, to talk about what Comey can and cannot say in his testimony. \u201cOur hope is that the chairman and I will be able to sit down and again just kind of get the rules of the road for us going forward with Director Mueller,\u201d Warner said. First on CNN: Russian officials bragged they could use Flynn to influence Trump, sources say Flynn resigned from the Trump White House in February after it was revealed he\u2019d misled White House officials over his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which included communication about sanctions. In what could be a signal of additional problems for Flynn, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new letter on Monday calling for Chaffetz to issue subpoenas for White House documents. The letter from Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings cites a Report of Investigation from the Pentagon, which was conducted by investigators undertaking a review for Flynn\u2019s security clearance application. According to that March 14, 2016 report, Flynn made false statements to investigators about who funded his foreign trips, including a 2015 trip to Russia where Flynn was paid roughly $45,000 for a speaking engagement. He claimed they were funded by \u201cUS companies,\u201d even though he was paid by Russia Today, according to the letter released Monday by House Democrats on the Oversight Committee. The report stated that Flynn said he \u201chad not received any benefit from a foreign country.\u201d Flynn also claimed to investigators he had no substantial contacts with foreign government officials, saying he only had \u201cinsubstantial contact,\u201d but photos from the event showed Flynn sitting near Putin at that 2015 RT dinner. The committee Democrats say Chaffetz must subpoena documents from the White House to determine what the White House was told about these foreign contacts and trips. In the letter, Cummings demanded that Chaffetz either \u201cissue a subpoena to the White House for the documents it is withholding or schedule a business meeting during which committee members can vote to issue the subpoena ourselves.\u201d Flynn previously sought immunity from the Senate committee in exchange for his testimony. Leaders of both the Senate and House panels, which are conducting separate investigations into Russia\u2019s election-year meddling, rejected that request. During the 2016 campaign, Trump blasted aides to Hillary Clinton for taking the Fifth Amendment in relation to the investigation of her use of a private email server while secretary of state. He said at a September Iowa rally: \u201cSo there are five people taking the Fifth Amendment, like you see on the mob, right? You see the mob takes the Fifth. If you\u2019re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?\u201d First on CNN: Comey now believes Trump was trying to influence him, source says Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican on the intelligence panel, said Flynn\u2019s decision would not stop the committee\u2019s investigation, tweeting: \u201cIt is Mike Flynn\u2019s right to plead the 5th. We will get to the truth one way or another. We need facts, not speculation & anonymous sources.\u201d It is Mike Flynn's right to plead the 5th. We will get to the truth one way or another. We need facts, not speculation & anonymous sources. Flynn is one of several former Trump aides to whom Senate investigators have sent requests for information to as part of the panel\u2019s investigation into connections between Trump associates and Russian officials. The panel has also sought documents from former campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The House intelligence panel, meanwhile, is requesting documents from former Trump campaign communications adviser Michael Caputo.",

            "article_content": "Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates spoke at a Senate subcommittee Monday President Donald Trump tweeted about the hearing hours before it started Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she alerted the White House earlier this year that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be \u201cessentially blackmailed by the Russians.\u201d \u201cWe believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,\u201d Yates told a Senate judiciary subcommittee, in a high-profile hearing on Russian meddling into the US election. Yates told the panel that she had a meeting with White House Counsel Donald McGahn on January 26 to tell him that she had information that statements by Vice President Mike Pence, based on his conversations with Flynn, were false. She was joined in the meeting by a senior career official in the Justice Department. RELATED: The many paths from Trump to Russia \u201cWe weren\u2019t the only ones that knew all of this, that the Russians also knew about what General Flynn had done and the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others,\u201d Yates said, relating the contents of her conversation with McGahn. Yates was speaking at a hearing led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, who opened the hearing with an implicit rebuke of the President and his alternative explanations for the interference in the election. The South Carolina Republican said the hacking was not the work of \u201csome 400-pound guy sitting on a bed or any other country,\u201d a reference to a comment Trump has previously made on the matter. Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner said Monday after the hearing\u2019s conclusion that he is declining comment on Yates\u2019 testimony. Trump fired Flynn, a retired general, for failing to disclose discussions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak about US sanctions against the Kremlin and for not telling the truth about them to Vice President Mike Pence. Yates did not say specifically that her concerns about Flynn\u2019s behavior was related to these calls, but she appeared to be implying that was the case. In her opening statement, Yates said that she planned to be as \u201cfulsome and comprehensive as possible\u201d within ethical and legal boundaries. Yates also warned in her opening testimony that there were some issues she could not address publicly because they involved classified information. Similarly, she said that as a former official she was not authorized to discuss Department of Justice or other executive branch deliberations. It was not immediately clear how those constraints would affect her testimony on the Flynn question. Neither Flynn nor Trump were directly referenced in her opening statement. \u201cThe efforts by a foreign adversary to interfere and undermine our democratic processes \u2014 and those of our allies \u2014 pose a serious threat to all Americans,\u201d Yates said. Graham asked Yates whether she had any information about whether there was collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia. \u201cMy answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information,\u201d Yates said. At one point in the hearing Graham asked both Clapper and Yates how information about Flynn\u2019s conversations with the Russian ambassador, that eventually led to his sacking, made it into the newspapers. Trump asked a similar question earlier on Twitter. Both former official said they did not know how that happened. Trump went on the offensive on Twitter Monday morning, hours before the hearing began, blaming the Obama administration for Flynn\u2019s security clearance and asking the committee to question Yates over leaking classified information to the media. \u201cGeneral Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,\u201d Trump wrote, adding later, \u201cAsk Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council.\u201d A White House official told CNN that the administration plans to rebut Yates by employing two strategies: Calling into question her objectivity by arguing she is a partisan Democrat and questioning the timeline of events she is expected to present. RELATED: Five things to watch at the Sally Yates hearing The Senate judiciary committee\u2019s crime and terrorism subcommittee also heard from former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who spoke in advance of Yates. He testified that he did not know about the FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the election and whether there were any links to the Trump campaign until its existence was announced in a congressional hearing by FBI Director James Comey in March. \u201cDuring my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director \u2013 both (former FBI) Director (Robert) Mueller and Director Comey \u2013 on whether, when, and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations,\u201d Clapper said. Trump hailed Clapper\u2019s comments and said they backed his claim that there was no evidence to support allegations of collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. \u201cDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of collusion w/ Russia and Trump,\u201d Trump said in the first of a series of tweets after the hearing. Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is \"no evidence\" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. Likewise, a White House official drew attention to Clapper\u2019s comments and added: \u201cRemember, the bottom line w/ the Russia stuff is the question of collusion during the campaign.\u201d Clapper issued a clarion call for vigilance over Russian election interference before it further eroded US democracy. \u201cThey must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are now emboldened to continue such activities in the future, both here and around the world, and to do so even more intensely.\u201d Graham, the leader of Monday\u2019s hearing, also invited former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, to testify with Yates and Clapper, but she rejected the invitation through her lawyer, noting the last-minute timing of the invitation. A source familiar with Rice\u2019s discussions told CNN that when Graham invited her, Rice believed it was a bipartisan overture and was prepared to accept. However, ranking Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse indicated to her that the invitation was made without his agreement, as he believed her presence was not relevant to the topic of the hearing, according to the source. Of the four former Trump campaign aides at the center of the Capitol Hill\u2019s Russia probes \u2013 including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page and former campaign adviser Roger Stone \u2013 Flynn has generated the most heat following a steady stream of revelations. RELATED: In angry letter, Page discloses \u2018brief interactions\u2019 with Russian official Investigators on the House oversight committee raised the possibility last month that Flynn may have broken the law by not disclosing payments from RT-TV, widely considered by US officials to be a propaganda arm of the Russian government, on his 2016 national security clearance form. Flynn\u2019s lawyer at the time argued that Flynn had been open about his speech to RT-TV, including briefing the Defense Intelligence Agency on his trip. Yates\u2019 appearance itself had been fraught with drama ever since House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes\u2019 delayed her House hearing at the last minute, as part of a chaotic three-week stretch that saw the House Russia investigation almost fall apart and Nunes become the subject of a House ethics probe. The Washington Post reported at the time that the White House had blocked Yates by asserting executive privilege, which allows the President to stop a former aide from testifying. White House press secretary Sean Spicer vehemently denied the reports at the time and said that the White House actively supports Yates\u2019 testifying in public. A White House official said last week that the administration still wants Yates to testify in public and reaffirmed Spicer\u2019s comments. Graham and Whitehouse also said they heard of no effort to stop her from coming before them. Still, Democrats on the House Russia investigation are anxiously watching Monday\u2019s hearing: First, to see if Yates shows up and, second, to see how much she reveals publicly.

            "article_content": "Sally Yates will testify before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee at 2:30 p.m. ET The former acting attorney general expected to contradict the White House Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is expected to deliver long-awaited testimony Monday afternoon before a Senate subcommittee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Yates was thrust into the national spotlight after she broke with President Donald Trump over the enforcement of his travel ban, an action which led to her firing in January. But since then, her profile has only risen following revelations that she said she forcefully warned the administration about former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s communications with a Russian diplomat weeks before Flynn was fired. Just hours before Yates was scheduled to testify, former Obama officials confirmed to CNN that then-President Barack Obama warned Trump about hiring Flynn as his national security adviser in their Oval Office meeting November 10. The news was first reported by NBC. And CNN also reported Monday morning that former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page told Senate investigators that he had \u201cbrief interactions\u201d several years ago with a Russian official he said was a \u201cjunior attach\u00e9,\u201d even though US officials had suspected the official of spying on behalf of the Kremlin. Here are five things to watch in Yates\u2019 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which is scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. ET on Capitol Hill. Yates told White House staff and other top officials that Flynn could be a security risk after he discussed Russia sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, CNN reported last week. That testimony is expected to contradict the White House\u2019s description of her warning, framed by press secretary Sean Spicer as \u201ca \u2018heads-up\u2019 to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he (Flynn) had sent the vice president.\u201d Trump on Twitter Monday blamed the Obama administration for giving Flynn, who briefly led the Defense Intelligence Agency during the 44th president\u2019s tenure, \u201cthe highest security clearance.\u201d General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that. He quickly added: \u201cAsk Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. (counsel).\u201d But did Yates discuss more with the Trump administration? Were other interactions uncovered? Did she find additional information on other top Trump aides at the center of the Russia probes? Her testimony comes after weekend reports in The Washington Post and CNN that a former US official said Trump\u2019s transition team warned Flynn about the risks of communicating with Kislyak weeks before he did. Flynn stepped down from his position as national security adviser after reports surfaced that the Justice Department warned the Trump administration that Flynn misled administration officials regarding his communications with the Russian ambassador and was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians. A White House official told CNN that the administration plans to rebut Yates by employing two strategies: Calling into question her objectivity by arguing she is a partisan Democrat and questioning the timeline of events she is expected to present, namely why \u201cshe and others at DOJ sat on their hands\u201d after Vice President Mike Pence insisted on television Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn\u2019s misleading of Pence before those interviews was a major reason he was forced to resign. The official said that the White House views Yates as someone looking to launch a political career \u2013 she has been rumored to be considering a bid for Georgia governor \u2013 and that taking on the Trump administration could be the springboard she needs. Democrats have pinned a lot of hopes on Yates, privately promising blockbuster testimony from the former Obama administration official. But a key question is how much she will be limited in public, either through questions regarding classified material, promises of attorney-client privilege or claims of executive privilege from either Trump or Obama. Yates\u2019 first public hearing was scheduled for six weeks ago, but it was canceled at the last minute by Trump ally and House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Reports later emerged that the White House blocked her testimony, which press secretary Spicer vehemently denied. Monday\u2019s hearing comes a week after FBI Director James Comey spoke to the full Judiciary Committee as well as House investigators. Comey, too, was limited in what he could say, citing an active investigation. As senators tried to pry any bit of information out of him, Comey beat back questions about the continuing federal probe into Russian interference in the US elections, and he likewise revealed few new details to the House intelligence committee. We know now that Yates alerted White House counsel Don McGahn to Flynn\u2019s phone calls with Kislyak. Flynn\u2019s misleading comments, Yates said, made him potentially vulnerable to being compromised by Russia, according to sources familiar with her version of events. She expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d to McGahn, making it clear \u2013 without making a recommendation \u2013 that Flynn could be fired. What happened next isn\u2019t clear. After that meeting, the White House took three weeks to fire Flynn, which happened in February. But did McGahn ever tell Trump about Yates\u2019 warning? The House intelligence committee was supposed to get the first crack at Yates in public, on March 28. But that hearing got swept up in the fiasco surrounding Nunes\u2019 clandestine White House trip and later led to him stepping aside from leading his panel\u2019s investigation. It took a month for House investigators to even settle on inviting Yates back for a new hearing, but by that point Graham had already booked her for his investigation with the Senate Judiciary subcommittee. As of last Friday, House investigators still had not settled on a date for her new hearing or if there will be one at all. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper is also set to testify. Look for questions about why his earlier assessment of Russian interference in the election contradicted the well-established version now, which is that not only was Russian interference omnipresent, but it was also designed specifically to help Trump. Republican lawmakers have periodically brought this up over the last few months. Now will be their chance to hear directly from Clapper about whether his previous belief still stands.

            "article_content": "The Senate's top Republican said it's likely they will investigate Gen. Michael Flynn Vice President Mike Pence met with the Republican senators Tuesday and discussed Flynn with them Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it\u2019s \u201chighly likely\u201d the Senate intelligence committee will investigate former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s discussions with the Russian ambassador. \u201cI think the fundamental question for us is what is our involvement in it, and who ought to look at it,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cAnd the intelligence committee is already looking at Russian involvement in our election. As Sen. (Roy) Blunt has already indicated, it is highly likely they will want to take look at this episode as well. They have the broad jurisdiction to do it.\u201d The Senate\u2019s second-ranking Republican and other GOP senators have called for an investigation into the episode, building on a string of investigations underway on Russian interference in the US elections. Sen. John Cornyn told reporters Tuesday that the Senate standing committees with oversight of intelligence needs to investigate. Asked by CNN if he wanted the Senate\u2019s committees to investigate Flynn, Cornyn replied: \u201cYes.\u201d But Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, was not ready to say Flynn should testify before Congress. \u201cI think it\u2019s symbolic of somebody with a distinguished military career making a bad mistake,\u201d Cornyn said of Flynn. Flynn resigned from his position as national security adviser Monday following reports that the Justice Department warned the Trump administration last month that he misled administration officials about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador and whether they addressed the issue of sanctions. The conversations occurred before he was an official government employee, causing some to fear that he was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians for covering up details of the exchanges. It is illegal for unauthorized private citizens to negotiate with foreign governments on behalf of the US. Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who was pushed into the center of the story after he defended Flynn on TV one month ago \u2013 did not respond to shouted questions as he left the Capitol Tuesday. Pence has yet to say how he feels about Flynn\u2019s actions. Pence met with Senate Republicans Tuesday at the Capitol for their weekly lunch and discussed Flynn\u2019s resignation, although senators in attendance said he did not discuss his personal feelings. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who used to serve with Pence in the House of Representatives, said that Pence thanked Flynn for his service and explained that \u201cwhen discrepancies arose, they realized they had to do something.\u201d \u201cAnd obviously the president made the call,\u201d Cassidy added. \u201cFolks understand that Gen. Flynn served at the discretion of the president, and the president decided to make a change.\u201d Pence told senators they are looking at three names to replace Flynn, Sen. Bob Corker told reporters. And Sen. John McCain suggested the White House consider David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal for the position. Lawmakers from both the House and Senate spent much of the day Tuesday answering questions of how they would respond to Flynn\u2019s resignation and reports of his calls with the Russian ambassador. Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, said that Trump should be asked if he directed Flynn to talk with Russian officials, \u201cI think that should be asked to the president. To the question of executive privilege as to the president should discuss you know what he knows.\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, told KTRS radio he wanted to speak with Flynn. Blunt told KTRS radio that an investigation \u201cneeds\u201d to happen. \u201cI think everybody needs that investigation to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Senate intelligence committee, again that I serve on, has been given the principle responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn\u2019t reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions.\u201d Blunt said lawmakers need to talk to Flynn \u201cvery soon.\u201d \u201cI would think that we should talk to Gen. Flynn very soon and that should answer a lot of questions. What did he know? What did he do? And is there any reason to believe that anybody knew that and didn\u2019t take the kind of action they should have taken,\u201d he asked. Cornyn said that he had not been briefed on the transcripts of calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the US, but expects the issue to come up with members of the Senate intelligence committee meet later Tuesday. \u201cI think there\u2019s an orderly process to make sure we get accurate information and we can the appropriate oversight and that\u2019s what we ought to do,\u201d the Texas senator said. Sen. Lindsey Graham also said he wants an investigation into Flynn\u2019s conversations with a Russian ambassador about sanctions. \u201cI think Congress needs to be informed of what actually Gen. Flynn said to the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions,\u201d the South Carolina Republican told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on \u201cAt This Hour.\u201d \u201cAnd I want to know, did Gen. Flynn do this by himself or was he directed by somebody to do it?\u201d Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told reporters he hadn\u2019t made a decision yet on whether Flynn should testify. Other Republicans have called for an investigation into the leaks over the information related to Flynn, instead of into the actions of the former national security adviser himself. The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virgnia, told CNN the American public \u201cdeserves\u201d to know more about Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation and the events leading up to it. \u201cI think it would be appropriate for Mr. Flynn, now that he has resigned, to testify,\u201d Warner said. \u201cI think we need to know what he knows. Not just in terms of these conversations. Clearly he indicated by his own admission that he did not fully disclose information to the vice president. I think there is more to come on this subject.\u201d Flynn had conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States before he was a government employee causing some to fear that he was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, amid a whirling recounting of his electoral triumph to the eight highest-ranking lawmakers in the US Congress, veered sharply off path when it came to his popular vote loss. He claimed that between 3 and 5 million \u201cillegals\u201d voted for Hillary Clinton. As evidence? A story he\u2019d heard. Trump\u2019s divergence during what was described by one person with direct knowledge as an otherwise \u201cfairly light\u201d 10-minute account, brought forth the objection of multiple Democrats sitting around the table. Trump countered with a story, according to two people with direct knowledge of the exchange. Famed golfer Bernhard Langer, the German two-time Masters champion, was lined up to vote in Florida, when he was informed he would not be allowed to vote by an authority present. Individuals, described to lawmakers as of Latin American descent, were in line around Langer and were allowed to cast ballots. Trump to move forward with voter fraud probe Trump told lawmakers he was under the impression, based on the story conveyed by Langer, that the individuals likely weren\u2019t legal voters. As Trump completed his story, the gathered lawmakers sat \u201cin an exceedingly awkward moment,\u201d according to one of the people, before Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 ranked Republican, quickly moved the group onto other topics. The account from the meeting was first reported by The New York Times. Langer himself, in a statement, blamed the media for Trump\u2019s mischaracterization of his story. Langer said, contrary to what Trump told lawmakers, that it wasn\u2019t him who had been in line, but a friend. And contrary to Trump\u2019s telling, it wasn\u2019t Langer who relayed the story personally to Trump, but a friend of Langer\u2019s who \u201cshared it with a person with ties to the White House.\u201d \u201cFrom there, this was misconstrued,\u201d Langer said in the statement. \u201cI am not a citizen of the United States, and cannot vote. It\u2019s a privilege to live in the United States, and I am blessed to call America my home.\u201d Langer said he would have no further comment on the story. Trump\u2019s comments during the meeting with Capitol Hill leaders kicked off a whirlwind 48 hours in which the Trump administration \u2013 and the President himself \u2013 continued to defend a statement about large-scale voter fraud that is both unproven and considered by everyone from voting experts to Republican secretaries of state, the officials responsible for overseeing the election, to be categorically false. Yet Trump has now pledged to launch an investigation into the matter, seizing in an interview with ABC News on \u201cpeople that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states.\u201d \u201cThere are millions of votes, in my opinion,\u201d Trump said. Registered voters don\u2019t necessarily vote, and there is no evidence that voter rolls populated by deceased or departed voters equate to fraudulent votes being cast.",

            "article_content": "Trump signed his first executive orders on Friday at the Resolute Desk Obama moved the Churchill bust to outside the Treaty Room in his private residence President Donald Trump restored the bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office immediately after assuming the presidency on Friday, the most notable move in an aesthetic redecoration of the space. Trump signed his first executive orders at the Resolute Desk before new gold curtains with a blue trim, a new sunburst-patterned carpet and new brocade couches. The Churchill bust sat on a sidetable, while the figure of Martin Luther King Jr. that former President Barack Obama had installed when he came into the White House remains next to the fireplace. Each president tends to decorate their own Oval Office. But the King-for-Churchill swap angered some Anglophiles \u2013 and conservative pundits \u2013 who felt that Churchill\u2019s ouster was an affront to the British. \u201cThere are only so many tables where you can put busts \u2013 otherwise it starts looking a little cluttered,\u201d Obama said at a press conference in London last April. \u201cAnd I thought it was appropriate, and I suspect most people here in the United Kingdom might agree, that as the first African American President, it might be appropriate to have a bust of  Dr. Martin Luther King in my office to remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office.\u201d Obama moved the Churchill bust to outside the Treaty Room in his private residence, enraging some conservative radio hosts and writers. 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney promised to bring it back to the Oval Office were he to be elected, and former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, a top surrogate of Trump\u2019s during the campaign, brought it up soon after the election when he met with the now-President. White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer pushed back against the outrage in a White House blog post in 2012. \u201cThe White House has had a bust of Winston Churchill since the 1960s. At the start of the Bush administration, Prime Minister (Tony) Blair lent President Bush a bust that matched the one in the White House, which was being worked on at the time and was later returned to the residence.  The version lent by Prime Minister Blair was displayed by President (George W.) Bush until the end of his presidency. On January 20, 2009 \u2013 Inauguration Day \u2013 all of the art lent specifically for President Bush\u2019s Oval Office was removed by the curator\u2019s office, as is common practice at the end of every presidency. The original Churchill bust remained on display in the residence. \u201cThe idea put forward by Charles Krauthammer and others that President Obama returned the Churchill bust or refused to display the bust because of antipathy towards the British is completely false and an urban legend that continues to circulate to this day.\u201d Some paintings have also been replaced by Trump. including two by the door by Edward Hopper. Trump has held onto \u201cThe Avenue in the Rain,\u201d by the American impressionist Childe Hassam, from Obama\u2019s Oval Office, and the back wall still hangs a painting of George Washington above the fireplace. The Swedish Ivy on the mantlepiece is also retained. Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush press secretary, said on Twitter the office now somewhat resembled the decor during the 43rd President\u2019s tenure.",

Conversations about Women, Leadership and Power\u201d and the founder of Feminist.com and the \u201cWhat Will It Take\u201d movement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. 2017 has been a turbulent and trying year for women. Beginning with the inauguration of Donald Trump, the year saw an escalation of the Republican Party\u2019s attacks on women, including efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, undermine women\u2019s legal and reproductive rights and slash essential health benefits. There were also threats to issues women care about: protections for children, civil rights and the environment, just to name a few.  And then came the explosive epidemic of reports of sexual harassment and assault, exposing just how pervasive this problem is for women in all sectors of society. With all that has happened, it\u2019s been hard for many women \u2013 and men \u2013 not to feel overwhelmed and discouraged. And yet\u2026 there is an upside: women are rising. In response to these attempts to diminish our power and silence our voices, women are harnessing their outrage. They are more engaged, energized and resolute than ever. Issues that were long ignored are finally coming to the surface, and women are beginning to speak up and use their voices and influence to demand real change. As New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, founder of Off the Sidelines, put it to me: \u201cOne of the only silver linings of the Trump presidency is that more and more women are feeling emboldened to raise their voices and fight for the issues that matter most to them, from sexual harassment in the workplace to paid leave. We saw that with the Women\u2019s March, and we saw it again on Election Day last month, when women all over the country got off the sidelines, ran for office, and won.\u201d (Editor\u2019s note: the author\u2019s daughter has interned for the senator.) This fire now burning in women explains why, even after such a rough year, we have reason to hope. I\u2019d like to offer these reasons to be optimistic about what 2018 has in store \u2013 to remind us that we are living in a watershed moment in our history, one we can broaden and deepen. A transformative moment. Rose McGowan: 'I have been slut-shamed' 1. Women everywhere are rising up, taking the women\u2019s movement into the mainstream. Women are protesting, marching, organizing and building power. From the millions who joined the Women\u2019s March to the survivors who have bravely come forward with their stories of sexual harassment and assault, to the millions participating in the #MeToo movement, it\u2019s become clear that women are not going to stay silent anymore. And these \u201csilence breakers\u201d \u2013 named as Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d \u2013 are not only speaking out, but are being heard. The \u201cwomen\u2019s movement\u201d has been swept into the mainstream and become more diverse, and social media has become increasingly effective at mobilizing younger generations of women and girls. At the same time, men are becoming more vocal and aware of gender issues and finding ways to be active as allies. And, this week, the word \u201cfeminism\u201d was named as Merriam-Webster\u2019s word of the year: It was the year\u2019s most-searched word on the dictionary\u2019s website. Harvey Weinstein is a symptom, but what is the deeper problem? As California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who has been one of the most outspoken advocates of this new \u201cresistance\u201d told me, \u201cWhen I spoke at the historic Women\u2019s March in January, I was extremely inspired and encouraged. Following the election of Donald Trump \u2013 a man who had defined himself as having no respect for women and who was prepared to use his office to turn back the clock on the progress that had been achieved by the women\u2019s movement, the civil rights movement, and the LGBTQ movement \u2013 a very diverse group of women organized the Women\u2019s March, which brought together thousands of women from all ages, ethnicities, religions, and walks of life, who showed up and gained the type of attention for our concerns that we haven\u2019t seen in many years. She continued: \u201cSince the march, I have been very pleased by the leadership and participation of younger generations of women, particularly the millennials, who are continuing what was started in January and are running for office at record levels, organizing their communities, and, as we have seen with #MeToo, are boldly speaking truth to power in order to fight for the change we so desperately need in this country. This is what the \u2018resistance\u2019 is all about, and these signs help me continue to be hopeful during this very tumultuous and chaotic period in our country.\u201d 2. Women\u2019s political power is growing. Women are running for office in record numbers, there has been a dramatic increase of women donors funding campaigns, and more and more strong women leaders are emerging. Parity for women in politics is being rightfully reframed as an essential component of a reflective democracy, and the need for women\u2019s input and voices in government has never been more clear. Emily\u2019s List, an organization devoted to electing female candidates, has reported a huge surge in women interested in running for office, with more than 22,000 women contacting the organization since Trump was elected. Other groups offering training programs for women report similar increases and also note the trends of a more diverse and younger cohort of women candidates. This November, one year out from Election Day 2018, the number of female House and Senate candidates was nearly double the number at the same point in 2016, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. The recent November election results offered promising wins for women and diversity, with cities across the country electing their first women, minority and/or transgender candidates into public office. Changes to the political landscape are further exemplified by the mobilization of black women voters as a decisive influence in the US Senate race out of Alabama on Tuesday. Emily\u2019s List President Stephanie Schriock encourages all women to get involved politically in any way they can: \u201cMy call to everybody is to get engaged now. And the way that we really make it happen, coast to coast, in every state, is by getting involved, whether it\u2019s a local race, whether you\u2019re running or you\u2019re backing somebody up. Democracy is not something you just sit on the sidelines of \u2013 you actually have to get involved, roll up your sleeves, and help out your sisters in doing this. We can make this happen.\u201d 3. Powerful men are being held accountable in cases of sexual harassment and assault. The world is watching as some of the most powerful and well-known male public figures topple from their pedestals as they face allegations of abusive behavior. Nearly all are swiftly losing their jobs and their platforms, and facing harsh public backlash. Reports: More women accuse Lauer of harassment Corporations and media entities are issuing strong statements and demonstrating zero tolerance for sexual misconduct, and politicians accused of abuse are also being pushed to resign. Reports of Alabama candidate Roy Moore\u2019s alleged sexual abuse arguably were responsible for his Senate loss this week, and a growing chorus of lawmakers and others are calling for Donald Trump to resign because of his alleged abuses (CNN has reported that both men deny the allegations). Eve Ensler, founder of the anti-violence group V-Day \u2013 and playwright of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d \u2013 told me that she recognizes that this moment of reckoning is a good start, but reminds us that we must continue to be proactive: \u201cThis could be a tipping point, but a lot has to happen. This tsunami of telling has to translate into concrete irreversible action \u2013 from telling to transformation, from revealing to revolution.\u201d 4. And men are a part of this cultural revolution. As #MeToo becomes the story of the year, many men are freshly reflecting on their own and their colleagues\u2019 behavior, and our society appears to be in the beginning of a long-overdue national conversation about the abuse of power and privilege, the socialization of men and boys, the objectification of women and a culture of toxic masculinity. We need 'extreme vetting' for toxic masculinity There is an important reframing underway: these are not \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d \u2013 too long misplaced, trivialized and marginalized as such \u2013 they are human issues that we need to address together. Ted Bunch, co-founder of A Call To Men, a group that educates men all over the world on healthy, respectful manhood, shared with me his hopes for the transformation this shift could bring: \u201cWe hope that men will start to understand that they are the solution. We have an opportunity to educate men about how our collective socialization results in a culture that devalues women and ultimately allows many forms of violence and discrimination to persist and harms all of us.\u201d Although 2017 has been full of obstacles, we can\u2019t deny that it has also emboldened women and girls. This is a potential tipping point, if we constructively use it and harness this energy. It requires that we all stay vigilant and address the issues we care about. Sen. Gillibrand told me: \u201cAs we head into the new year, my advice to women is this: Don\u2019t wait for some white knight in Washington to ride up and save us. You will wait forever. It is the grassroots who will create the message, launch the campaigns, and win the elections that finally change our country for the better.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Mark Bauerlein is a professor of English at Emory University, senior editor of the journal First Things and author of \u201cThe Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future; Or, Don\u2019t Trust Anyone Under 30.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. This is the real battle going on in DC today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. With a tax plan inching forward in stops and starts, Roy Moore\u2019s numbers, in his US Senate run in Alabama, rising (the President has now even endorsed him), and liberal eminences in politics and media facing sexual allegations that may be worse than those made against Trump, the anti- and never-Trump forces are in a worse state of incredulity than before. How can this guy still be chief executive \u2013 and even winning? At first their surprise might seem sensible: A few weeks ago, things looked bad for Trump. Health care reform was stalled, Roy Moore was behind, and the Virginia results foreshadowed a Democratic Senate to come. The time has been out of joint for long enough, Trump\u2019s critics believed, and the correction was finally happening. Indeed, we saw another setback on Friday, with Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, and fingers now pointing at Jared Kushner. But after all the other controversies that have happened and haven\u2019t much damaged Trump himself, people can\u2019t help but see this one as another sign of corruption that just won\u2019t stick. Just hours later, the Senate passed the tax bill. WH cites Trump agenda for backing Roy Moore And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump\u2019s way. This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don\u2019t mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality, and victimhood. In the Chronicle of Higher Education last week, Brittney Cooper, a professor at Rutgers had this critique about the legacy of Galileo, Newton, Pasteur, and Einstein: \u201cThe history of Western thought and science is predicated on the argument that African and indigenous peoples are inferior races.\u201d That\u2019s right \u2013 all those inventions and discoveries that we honor and the geniuses we remember had a racist underside, by her lights. Elsewhere in the article she wrote, \u201cNo questions have ever been off-limits for white scholars,\u201d a statement that would surprise every white scholar I\u2019ve ever known. People who still can\u2019t assimilate the ascent of Trump need to pay closer attention to these accusations. They\u2019re not uncommon. Sensible liberals shrug them off as, well, kind of true but not really significant to health care, the environment, reproductive rights, and other progressive planks. Trump's fired campaign manager writes book But people who voted for Trump have become especially attuned to such charges, and it only takes a quick playback by Rush Limbaugh or Tucker Carlson of the day\u2019s denunciation of America, white males, or the West by Professor X, Opinionator Y, or Celebrity Z to stoke their sense that the intellectuals loathe them. The more the accusers talk, the more rock hard Trump\u2019s base becomes. The remarkable thing is how many Republican leaders still haven\u2019t figured this out. After Trump dropped his Pocahontas remark at the meeting with Navajo veterans, Sen. John McCain berated him for \u201cpoliticizing these genuine heroes.\u201d Never mind that leftists have relentlessly politicized every demographic group in the country. Trump voters feel that by invoking her make-believe American Indian heritage, Sen. Elizabeth Warren played on those very identity politics to advance her career and mark her as more worthy of an elite job than any old white man. Last week, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged a pending ethics probe of Roy Moore should he win the election and take his seat, Laura Ingraham had to remind him of what that would say to Alabama voters. He came off as believing that the will of the people is one thing, but the will of the Senate is another. The culture wars and Twitter spats that Trump has fought have delighted his fans but cornered senators, who may be realizing that the opinion of the Great Unwashed is more important than the opinion of, say, The New York Times \u2013 more important, that is, to their job security. Trump: We need Republican Roy Moore to win When you sit at the top with an office in the Capitol and people lining up to tell you how wonderful you are, an academic on MSNBC going on about white privilege, toxic masculinity, and cisgender bias doesn\u2019t bother you. Nor does a school board that approves opposite-sex bathroom privileges for transgender students and casts concerned parents as \u201cphobic.\u201d But if you\u2019re a small businessman or blue-collar worker worried about cost of living and with children to feed and educate, and who thinks little about identity issues, those charges grate on your nerves. Trump is your champion, not the lords in Congress. If Republicans don\u2019t follow his lead, more of them will share the fate of Sen. Jeff Flake, whose political career the President has called \u201ctoast.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Malcolm Graham is a former Charlotte City Council member and Democratic N.C. state senator who has lived in Charlotte for more than 30 years. He is the brother of Cynthia Graham Hurd, one of the Emanuel 9 killed on June 17, 2015. The views expressed in this commentary are his. Malcolm Graham: Donald Trump has galvanized bigots to turn their hateful rhetoric into violent actions The attack in Charlottesville is the latest example of that violence taking an innocent life, writes Graham Our nation is playing a deadly game of follow the leader. Our highest elected leader won office on words of prejudice, exclusion and outright hate. Like-minded bigots \u2013 whether simply ignorant or inherently evil \u2013 now feel emboldened to publicly express the same, with language and gestures intended to intimidate. I\u2019d like to be able to talk only about how these sad, small men march for hate, then go home feeling like big, strong dudes and pat each other on the back in their online lovefests. But this past weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, one of those bigots went further, deciding he had the right and the power to take lives. The tragic event shows that we can\u2019t dismiss these racists as sad, small men. Not when it takes only one of them to graduate to terrorism and fatally wound us as individuals and as a country. This weekend was not the first time racism has taken innocent lives. We saw this two years ago in Charleston, South Carolina, where my sister Cynthia and eight others were murdered in their church by someone who acted on his racist beliefs and had access to tools that inflict irreparable damage. Forty years ago, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that parading the swastika is protected under the First Amendment. But there\u2019s a difference between carrying torches and pulling a trigger. If you want to march and let vile things roll off your tongue, fine. That\u2019s your right to free speech, no matter how pathetic and revealing of white privilege that speech is. When it spirals into violent action, whether it\u2019s firing a gun in a church or plowing a car into a crowd, that\u2019s terrorism. And as we\u2019ve seen time and time again \u2013 from Oklahoma City to Aurora, Colo., to Sandy Hook Elementary \u2013 that terrorism is often committed by white American men. Nazis have marched on our streets for years \u2013 long before people whitewashed their beliefs with terms like \u201cnationalist,\u201d \u201calt-right,\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d (And let\u2019s be honest, that last title is absurdly ironic, exposing the insecurity of those claiming it.) So what\u2019s new? President Trump. Twitter users are outing Charlottesville demonstrators Whether it\u2019s fudging facts about \u201ccrime-infested cities\u201d \u2013 you know, where black people live \u2013 or painting immigrants as members of ISIS or drug cartels, Trump continues to light a fire under white men who want to believe they\u2019re losing \u201ctheir\u201d country. Never mind that this country belongs to all of us. See \u201cWe, the people\u201d and \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d These words that our country was built upon are more important than ever when the president\u2019s staff includes multiple flag-bearers of hate \u2013 Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, and Stephen Miller, not to mention Attorney General (for now), Jeff Sessions, who was once denied a federal judgeship amid charges of racism. The acts of hatred and violence in Charlottesville are not eased by Trump\u2019s too-late condemnation of them. On Saturday he denounced bigotry \u201con many sides,\u201d adroitly avoiding calling out the groups responsible for it. Two days later, he declared that \u201cracism is evil\u201d as are the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups. Too little, too late. True character is shown in the moment, not days after the fact. It\u2019s shown by the people leaders surround themselves with, and let\u2019s not forget those advisers Trump has placed on the White House payroll.  Make no mistake. President Trump is responsible for making America openly hate again and galvanizing white supremacists. But Trump\u2019s poor initial response to the carnage in Charlottesville confirms he doesn\u2019t care. The best case scenario is he\u2019s just too scared to lose the support of racists. (Although, how someone could sleep at night knowing he\u2019s backed by the Ku Klux Klan is beyond me. No wonder he\u2019s always tweeting in the wee hours.) I would give anything to not say \u201cif there\u2019s an upside\u201d to what happened in Charlottesville and the rhetoric leading up to it. But here we are, so if there\u2019s an upside, it\u2019s this: The cockroaches are out in the light. So now, we can\u2019t avoid them. So much attention understandably has been given to attacks on our nation from abroad \u2013 from Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election to a potential war with North Korea. Charlottesville, like Charleston and other instances of terrorism before it, is an attack from within our borders by cowards who envision a United States that will never exist. No more hiding in the shadows, you vermin. Inspired by your leader, you ran out into the middle of the room. We see you, and we\u2019re bigger than you. We aren\u2019t scared. We\u2019re just disgusted.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David Jolly is a former Republican congressman from Florida.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. David Jolly: Congressional Republicans should respond to Trump's nonsensical approach to policy by ignoring him The President can own his own legacy, members of the GOP Congress don't have to be involved With President Donald Trump\u2019s nonsensical Twitter approach to both domestic and foreign policy, his tweets regularly descending into depravity, congressional Republicans often find themselves facing the question: \u201cDo you agree with the President\u2019s irreverence and self-contradictions, and if not, what will you do to restore sanity \u2013 to restore credibility, dignity?\u201d We have seen too many of them answer by remaining silent, or dodging, or merely offering their own 140-character criticism that distances themselves from the President. At best, those are attempts to quell the American people\u2019s anxiety over the President\u2019s behavior. At worst, they come across as affirmations of the public\u2019s suspicion that the GOP is only interested in self-preservation. But in the eyes of many, to simply criticize the President and then immediately return to working with him is a tacit acceptance of his approach to a free press \u2014 which smacks of authoritarianism \u2013 his subtle misogyny, and his perversion of what was once respected conservative ideology: He has turned it into a platform for self-promotion that draws its strength from our country\u2019s darkest angels. It is fair for both the media and concerned voters to demand more: a tangible, substantive GOP strategy that honestly confronts the President\u2019s waywardness in policy and personal integrity. Congressional Republicans\u2019 response should be this:  Ignore the President. Isolate him. Ghitis: Trump wants to rule, not govern You see, when members of Congress condemn a tweet and then fall in line with the President\u2019s awkward leadership of domestic and foreign policy \u2014 such as when they race to be his guest at a South Lawn ceremony celebrating passage of a flawed health care bill that even the President himself now disowns \u2013 all their condemnation, and congressional resolve itself, is exposed as meritless. This Republican Congress needs to take a stand for the party and for the country. It must rise to the responsibility and the privilege that Article I of the Constitution vests in Congress as a co-equal branch, the first branch envisioned by the founders, even ahead of the Presidency. Consider for a moment the congressional elections of 2016. The vast majority of Republican candidates ran on their own agenda, not Trump\u2019s. Remember that, after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes confirmed the candidate\u2019s (potentially criminal) arrogance, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan told House members, myself among them: Do what you have to do to get re-elected.  And so Republican candidates presented their platform to their constituencies, and steered away from their party\u2019s presidential nominee. So if you were a Republican elected to Congress on your own platform, distancing yourself from Donald Trump before the election, why would you fall subservient to his agenda and his moral failings now? Trump is destroying his credibility with the world Recall that Republican members of Congress were not elected on the platform of President Barack Obama, and understandably never fell in line with his agenda.  Well, this Republican Congress largely wasn\u2019t elected on Trump\u2019s platform either, yet today engages in subordination to a President who appears to have no understanding of policy nor traditional Republican orthodoxy. So to my former colleagues \u2013  good people, so many with very honest and sacrificial intentions on behalf of their country and constituent \u2013 the prescription for dealing with this President is simple. Ignore him. No more trips to the White House.  No more flights on Air Force One.  No more accepting his gratuitous offers of signing ceremonies, White House cocktails, or meetings with his children.  No more asking the White House for permission, for policy advice, or for the President\u2019s priorities. Honor your oath as a fiduciary of Article I, who holds the public trust.  Strike out with your own bold agenda that wins the hearts and minds of the American people.  And leave this President behind.  Leave him to his Twitter account and to placating his base with disgusting Tweets.  Tell the President of the United States that Congress will do its job. He can do his.  And the next time the speaker of the House will need the President is when he\u2019s dropping legislation on the Resolute desk, handing the President one of the speaker\u2019s own pens, and saying, \u201cHere Mr. President, sign on the dotted line.\u201d The President can own his own legacy.  It\u2019s time for Republicans in the House to once again own theirs.",

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Paul Callan: Don't expect shocking revelations when Comey testifies before a congressional committee next week He says Comey will be boxed into a tight corner by his previous unwillingness to answer questions due to national security and ongoing investigations Those waiting for shocking new revelations from James Comey in his congressional testimony next week are likely to be disappointed. After all, Comey is the same 6-foot-8-inch former FBI Director who attempted to \u201cblend in\u201d with the blue drapes during a previous White House visit with his then-boss, President Donald Trump, who fired him last month. Spectators at the Senate hearing will probably be treated to a gossipy inside look at the quirky interactions between these two unpredictable men.  Indeed, if Comey wishes to maintain any semblance of the reputation for integrity he so scrupulously cultivated before he blew up the presidential election, he will decline to reveal things that would compromise special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russia. Comey will also be boxed into a tight corner by his previous proclamations that he can\u2019t answer some questions because of national security and the need to maintain the integrity of ongoing investigations. Gergen: Invoking executive privilege a mistake Additionally, he may be impeded in answering questions about the conversations everyone really wants to know about: those that Comey had with the President. Why? The President may attempt to assert executive privilege \u2013 that is, he may claim that a private conversation in the White House with the director of the FBI \u2013 a federal employee answerable to the President \u2013 deserves confidentiality and full protection from public disclosure. Should the President assert this privilege, Congress and Comey might argue that the doctrine doesn\u2019t apply here if the discussion was related to a criminal attempt to obstruct justice. In the end, the complexity of this issue and the need to possibly resolve the matter in court could bring the congressional questioning of Comey to a screeching halt. As Comey\u2019s prior testimony indicates a desire to abide by the law,  it is unlikely that he would ride roughshod over a claim of executive privilege by his former boss, the President of the United States. During testimony given by then-Director Comey during the March 20 House Intelligence Committee hearing and his subsequent appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, Comey\u2019s most juicy offering was that that the FBI Intelligence Committee had clearly ascertained that the Russians and their leader Vladimir Putin hated Hillary Clinton and were actively attempting to assist in the election of Donald Trump.  Let\u2019s recall that key exchange with Republican Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas: Comey: Well, the assessment of the intelligence committee was, as the summer went on and the polls appeared to show that Secretary Clinton was gonna win, the Russians sort of gave up and simply focused on trying to undermine her\u2026.. Conaway: Sir, do you believe that the FBI was consistent through early December and on that that was the case. That they \u2013 they assessed that they really wanted Trump to win it and were working to help him win and her lose. Comey: Yes, our analysts had a view that I don\u2019t believe changed, from late fall through to the report on January 6 that it had those three elements. Enough for a headline, but not much more. Clinton blames Comey, DNC for election loss On the issue of whether operatives of the Trump campaign or the President himself actively colluded with the Russians in their efforts to sabotage the Clinton campaign in hopes of electing Trump, Comey declined to answer questions, taking \u201cno comment\u201d refuge in his \u201cpending investigation\u201d mantra. If questioned again in Congress next week about whether the President tried to obstruct the investigation of Trump campaign operative Gen. Michael Flynn, it will be impossible for Comey to walk away from his previous and oft repeated refusals to comment on specific individuals under investigation without shattering what remains of  his own reputation for integrity. Here are some samples of Comey\u2019s persistent refusals to answer specific investigation-related inquiries during the spring congressional hearings and questions from Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama: Sewell: Now, Director Comey, all of these accounts are open-source press reportings. Given Russia\u2019s long-standing desire to cultivate relations with influential US persons, isn\u2019t the American public right to be concerned about Mr. \u2013 Mr. Flynn\u2019s conduct, his failure to disclose that contact with the Russian ambassador, his attempts to cover it up and what looks like the White House\u2019s attempts to sweep this under the rug? Don\u2019t we, as the American people, deserve the right to know and shouldn\u2019t our FBI investigate such claims? Comey: I can\u2019t comment. I \u2013 I understand people\u2019s curiosity about our work and intense interest in it, and as Mr. King said, oftentimes, speculation about it. But we can\u2019t do it well or fairly to the people we investigate if we talk about it. So I can\u2019t comment. And later\u2026 NYT reporter: Trump joked about Russia ties Sewell: What level of proof do we need in order for us to have a criminal investigation by the FBI of Mr. Flynn? Comey: I can\u2019t comment on that. Sewell: Shouldn\u2019t the American people be concerned what \u2013 I think that it\u2019s really hard for us to fathom that he wouldn\u2019t know that he should\u2019ve disclosed that he received $30,000 as a part of \u2013 of a speaking engagement to RT, the Russian US anti-propaganda outlet. Comey: I can\u2019t comment on that Ms. Sewell. Under similar questioning by Sens. Al Franken and Richard Blumenthal and others about Flynn and other Trump campaign operatives, Comey refused to comment on the pending FBI investigations. A series of questions from Blumenthal are particularly revealing of how trapped Comey will be in his own \u201cNo Comment Zone\u201d when questioned in future congressional hearings: Blumenthal: With respect to the investigation, I\u2019m going into the Trump associates ties to the Russian meddling. Has the White House cooperated? Comey: With the investigation? Blumenthal: Correct. Comey: That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to comment on. Blumenthal: Have you had any requests for immunity from anyone, potentially a target of that investigation? Comey: I have to give you the same answer, senator. Blumenthal: Would you tell this committee if there is a lack of cooperation on the part of the White House? Comey: I won\u2019t commit to that. Graham rips Comey for misleading Congress The history-making, big-bang revelations in congressional investigations often come from surprise witnesses rather than from the usual suspects. For instance, in the Nixon Watergate probe the existence of Nixon\u2019s White House taping system was revealed in a surprise tidbit of testimony from a little-known presidential aide named Alexander Butterfield. Nothing of similar magnitude came from White House big guns like Chief of Staff HR Haldeman or White House Domestic Affairs Adviser John Ehrlichman. Similarly, though a repeat appearance by Comey will generate an enormous television audience, don\u2019t expect disclosure of important new evidence supporting claims of obstruction of justice against the President. Instead, we are likely to hear that Comey is a careful note-taker, though it is doubtful that the actual notes will be produced.   It is far more likely that Mueller will want the notes of Comey\u2019s presidential conversations to remain confidential until a sitting grand jury gets a look at them. Why Washington is leaking like a sieve Comey is likely to cooperate with the request of Mueller, his respected law enforcement colleague and friend, and reveal little of substance to Congress. After all, Comey has a reputation to defend and even though now a civilian, he will feel bound by the FBI and Department of Justice rules of policy and ethics as well as the attorneys\u2019 Code of Professional Responsibility. These rules strongly limit prosecutorial comment on pending criminal investigations. Comey lost his job and may well have influenced the American presidential election the last time he ignored these rules with headline grabbing revelations about the Hillary Clinton email probe. Given that powerful lesson, it is unlikely he will comment on a pending investigation again even in his new civilian role. In the end, we can expect a cascade of colorful sparks and thick smoke but no real fire at the next edition of \u201cComey under oath\u201d. Unless, of course, a new Alexander Butterfield emerges from the chaos of the Trump White House.",

Follow him on Twitter @pagepate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Page Pate: Trump and Kushner have lawyered up for special counsel's probe into Russia meddling in last election But hiring a lawyer doesn't mean that the White House can circle the wagons and refuse to cooperate, he writes President Donald Trump has reportedly hired a private lawyer to represent him during the probe by the newly appointed special counsel into Russia\u2019s meddling in the last election, and any unlawful collusion that may have occurred between the Russians and Trump\u2019s campaign. Jared Kushner has also retained counsel, and it\u2019s certain that other lawyers both inside and outside the beltway were called about this case over the holiday weekend after a big meeting at the White House to plot strategy. While neither the President nor anyone else has been named a formal target of this investigation, \u201clawyering up\u201d right now makes sense. Good call. An experienced lawyer will help explain a client\u2019s rights in a criminal investigation, and can usually help a client understand how they may fit into the big picture of the case. A lawyer will also be able to run interference between the client and the investigators or prosecutor. Perhaps most importantly, especially with a tweet-happy client like the President, a lawyer with experience in federal criminal cases will try to keep the client from doing anything stupid during the course of the investigation. History reminds us that if anything is indeed amiss, it\u2019s not always the crime that gets you, it can be the cover-up. White House defends Kushner's Russia contact But hiring a lawyer doesn\u2019t mean that the White House should circle the wagons and refuse to cooperate with Congress and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. If the President and his staff did nothing wrong during the election and the transition period, then they should give Mueller and Congress everything they ask for, and then give them some more. Mr. President, if you are innocent and want this investigation over, it\u2019s time to fully cooperate with this investigation. Empty out the boxes. Turn over all relevant financial documents, travel records, and any notes of contacts with foreign officials that do not directly relate to national security. If necessary, waive any attorney-client privilege issues that may have contributed to your personal lawyer\u2019s refusal to provide information to Congress. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has taken the first step towards cooperation by providing business and personal documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee. That\u2019s a good start, and a good example for the White House to follow Authorize your staff to agree to any reasonable interview requests by the investigators. Let them take advantage of any opportunities to testify before any congressional committee that offers an appearance. Although the decision for White House staff to cooperate in the investigation needs to be made by each staff member with the advice of counsel, you and your top advisers shouldn\u2019t do anything to stand in the way. If you do, it may be a separate crime of obstruction. John Kelly: Russia back-channel not a big deal Stonewalling document requests from Congress and putting together a \u201cwar room\u201d in the White House to plot strategy is not obstruction by itself, but it\u2019s not how someone with nothing to hide responds to an independent investigation, especially when that investigation is being run by a special counsel appointed by your own Justice Department. If, as you have often claimed, there is nothing to all this talk about collusion with Russia, the best legal and political strategy for the White House is to cooperate. As a criminal defense lawyer, I understand and fully appreciate the decision to lawyer up right now. It\u2019s a safe bet that Trump and other White House officials will need legal counsel going forward, and I\u2019m sure these lawyers will more than earn their fee. But as a voter and a taxpayer, I hope the White House will cooperate with this investigation. If there is nothing to all this talk about collusion with Russia, there is no reason not to cooperate. Not only will cooperation make this process go a lot faster, it may help the White House convince the skeptics that there really is no criminal conduct to uncover. Cooperate because it\u2019s good for the country. Cooperate because it\u2019s the right thing to do. Or, if that doesn\u2019t matter to you, cooperate because it makes you look better. Mr. President, you can  continue to protest this investigation as \u201cunfair\u201d and politically driven. But this is not a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and it\u2019s not \u201cfake news\u201d cooked up by the media. Russia interfered in the election; all of our nation\u2019s intelligence agencies agree on this.  If you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, there is nothing to be afraid of. If you have done something wrong, America will find out whether you cooperate or not. We always do.",
