He writes about education and Latino issues on the White Rhino Blog. Follow him on Twitter @whiterhinoray. By Ray Salazar, Special to CNN (CNN) \u2013 Finally, Republicans and Democrats know that they need more than mariachis playing behind them to win the Latino vote. By now, almost everyone heard about the Latino influence this presidential election. The signs were everywhere. Maybe this is the 2012 cosmic event predicted by the Mayan calendar. Now, President Obama must recognize Latino views as he moves forward with economic recovery and immigration policy and farther with education reform. None of the parties should have been surprised by the Latino vote. On October 7, CNN\u2019s \u201cLatino in America: Courting the Latino Vote\u201d reported that more than 60,000 Latinos turn 18 each month across the country, and we care about more than immigration. When Latinos were given a choice between what\u2019s more important, immigration or the economy, 74% chose the economy. Obama\u2019s modified DREAM Act did, though, help secure 71% of the Latino vote. Romney\u2019s unclear view of immigration reform contributed to only 27% of his Latino vote. More notably, the Latino vote for Obama exceeded the national Latino average in some battleground states: 87% in Colorado, 80% in Nevada and 82% in Ohio. These votes indicate that the conversations need to change. For too long, education reform remained a black and white issue, racially and politically. Our educational system as is does not work, especially not for Latinos. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Latino dropout rate is almost double that of African-Americans and about three times higher than that of whites. FULL STORY",

            "article_content": "By Alicia W.\u00a0 Stewart, CNN (CNN) \u2013 In his first major news conference since March, President Barack Obama expressed confidence in passing immigration reform in his second term. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a sense of empowerment and civic participation (among Latinos) that I think is going to be powerful and good for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is why I\u2019m very confident that we can get immigration reform done.\u201d In response to a question from Telemundo reporter Lori Montenegro, the president spoke about increased Latino voter turnout, the DREAM Act and border security. Read his full answer in the excerpt below. You can also read the full transcript of the news conference here. Montenegro: On immigration reform, the criticism in the past has been that you did not put forth legislation with specific ideas and send it up to the Hill. This time around, you have said again that this will be one of the top priorities for a second term. Will you, then, send legislation to the Hill? And exactly what do you envision is broad immigration reform? Does that include a legalization program? And also, what lessons, if any, did Democrats learn from this last election and the Latino vote? Obama: Well, I think what was incredibly encouraging was to see a significant increase in Latino turnout. This is the fastest-growing group in the country and, you know, historically what you\u2019ve seen is Latino vote \u2013 vote at lower rates than the broader population. And that\u2019s beginning to change. You\u2019re starting to see a sense of empowerment and civic participation that I think is going to be powerful and good for the country. And it is why I\u2019m very confident that we can get immigration reform done. Before the election, I had given a couple of interviews where I predicted that Latino vote was going to be strong and that that would cause some reflection on the part of Republicans about their position on immigration reform. I think we\u2019re starting to see that already. I think that\u2019s a positive sign. This has not historically been a partisan issue. We\u2019ve had President (George W.)\u00a0 Bush and John McCain and others who have supported comprehensive immigration reform in the past. So, we need to seize the moment. And my expectation is that we get a bill introduced and we begin the process in Congress very soon after my inauguration. \u2026 And, in fact, some conversations I think are already beginning to take place among senators and congressmen and my staff about what would this look like. And when I say comprehensive immigration reform, it\u2019s very similar to the outlines of previous immigration reform. I think it should include a continuation of the strong border security measures that we\u2019ve taken. Because we have to secure our border. I think it should contain serious penalties for companies that are purposely hiring undocumented workers and \u2013 and taking advantage of them. And I do think that there should be a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, are not engaged in criminal activity, are here to \u2013 simply to work. I\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s important for them to pay back taxes. It\u2019s important for them to learn English. It\u2019s important for them to potentially pay a fine, but to give them the avenue whereby they can resolve their legal status here in this country, I think is very important. Obviously making sure that we put into law what \u2013 the first step that we\u2019ve taken administratively dealing with the DREAM Act kids is very important as well. The one thing that I\u2019m - I\u2019m very clear about is that young people who are brought here through no fault of their own, who have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to our flag, want to serve in our military, want to go to school and contribute to our society, that they shouldn\u2019t be under the cloud of deportation. That we should give them every opportunity to earn their citizenship. And so, you know there are other components to it, obviously. The business community continues to be concerned about getting enough high-skilled workers. And I am a believer that if you\u2019ve got a Ph.D. in physics, or computer science who wants to stay here, and start a business here, we shouldn\u2019t make it harder for them to stay here, we should try to encourage him to contribute to this society. I think that the agricultural sector, obviously has very specific concerns about making sure that they\u2019ve got a work force that helps deliver food to our table. So they\u2019re gonna be a bunch of components to it, but I think whatever process we have needs to make sure border security\u2019s strong, needs to deal with employers effectively, needs to provide a pathway for the undocumented here, needs to deal with the DREAM Act kids. And I think that\u2019s something that we can get done.",

            "article_content": "By Mariano Castillo, CNN (CNN) \u2013 Comprehensive immigration reform has so far eluded President Barack Obama. But with his re-election victory in battleground states propelled by strong Latino support, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have a stronger interest in cultivating support from a group with growing political clout. Here are five reasons why the time may be right for immigration reform to take hold in Washington. 1) The voters have spoken Immigration reform may not have been the biggest issue in the election \u2013 the economy was paramount \u2013 but it is very important to a key segment of voters. Latino voters turned out in force and helped to tip battleground states in Obama\u2019s favor. The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the past four years to 12.2 million, or 8.7% of all voters. That means this demographic will only increase its political power. Issues important to this minority logically will become increasingly important to both major political parties. 2) Obama promised but failed to deliver on immigration reform Obama promised to push for immigration reform before the 2008 election and had to answer tough questions from Latinos about why that did not occur. At a forum by the Spanish-language Univision network, Obama was pressed to admit that he had fallen short and took responsibility for a lack of action. But the president also said he didn\u2019t promise he would accomplish everything he wanted right away. FULL STORY",

Follow him on Twitter. By Ali Noorani, Special to CNN (CNN) \u2013 Both parties have received an electoral politics wake-up call, courtesy of a diversifying America. President Obama won re-election thanks in part to a 52-percentage-point spread among Latino voters, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing electorate, according to election eve polling. In the America coming over the horizon, it is practically impossible to overcome such a number and win the race for president. According to the polling by Latino Decisions, Hispanic voters nationally and across every battleground state swung heavily to Democrats. And it wasn\u2019t even close. Nationwide, the margin was 75% to 23%. And there were remarkable spreads in the tightest of swing states: 87% to 10% in Colorado, 82% to 17% in Ohio, 66% to 31% in Virginia. (CNN\u2019s own poll showed a smaller but still significant spread nationwide \u2013 71% to 21% \u2013 and in the swing states). Even in Florida, with its large, Republican-leaning Cuban population, the Latino Decisions poll found that Latinos overall favored the president 58% to 40%. While these trends worked to Democrats\u2019 advantage on the ground on Tuesday, that\u2019s not entirely good news: A demographically challenged Republican Party is bad for America. As a nation, we are at our best when both parties work together to address difficult policy issues. And, in the case of immigration \u2013 an issue of great concern to Latinos \u2013 a bipartisan roadmap is good politics and great policy. FULL STORY",

Last December, the Justice Department said it had found cause to believe the sheriff\u2019s office \u201chas engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the Constitution and federal law\u201d and, under the leadership of Arpaio, discriminated against Latinos through traffic stops, detentions and arrests and against Latino inmates with limited English proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services.

Latino voters mobilized in an attempt to defeat him at the polls this year. Meanwhile, Arpaio told supporters Tuesday night, financial support for his campaign poured in from across the country. Latinos a key part of new Democratic majority Arpaio also gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents. Another controversial program: Arpaio\u2019s \u201cchain gangs,\u201d including the world\u2019s first-ever female and juvenile work gangs. Rather than shy away from controversy, he has embraced it, touting his nickname of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Toughest Sheriff\u201d on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation, costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece. He garnered 53% of votes cast in this year\u2019s election, and his chief opponent, Democrat Paul Penzone, conceded as results showed Arpaio ahead by 88,000 votes. \u201cArpaio won, you have to accept it,\u201d said Alberto Gutier, a Republican analyst. \u201cHe said it very clearly that he was going to be the sheriff that enforces laws, and not who makes laws.\u201d Five things we learned on Election Night But some Latino activists \u2013 who had hoped Penzone would unseat Arpaio \u2013 weren\u2019t ready to give in yet. \u201cThe pledge to each person whose door we knocked on, the people that we registered in front of stores and apartment buildings, is that every one of their votes will be counted,\u201d said Petra Falcon, director of Promise Arizona, an immigrant advocacy organization. Falcon said many people voted on provisional ballots in the election, or cast absentee ballots that had yet to be counted by elections officials. Her group estimates that more than 400,000 votes may have yet to be counted. The Arizona Secretary of State Office said Wednesday that there were 344,000 uncounted early votes in Maricopa County and 115,000 provisional ballots yet to be verified there. Other activists said that problems for immigrants go far beyond Maricopa County. \u201cMany people are happy that (President Barack) Obama won again and others are upset that Arpaio won, but we know that they both work together to deport members of our community,\u201d said Carlos Garcia, director of the Puente human rights organization. While authorities count provisional ballots, other opponents of the controversial sheriff are hoping that a federal judge will rule in the civil rights cases against the Arizona sheriff and stop the sheriff from cracking down on undocumented immigrants.

Instead they got crowned. No matter who wins on Tuesday, America\u2019s largest minority will be the loser. As a Latino voter, and part of one of the country\u2019s fastest growing demographics, I was supposed to choose the next president. No, really, it was all arranged. This was going to be my year, along with the other 10 million or so Latino voters expected to cast ballots Tuesday. Everyone said so \u2013 the pundits, the media, and the strategists. In February,\u00a0Time Magazine\u00a0had a cover story, with the eye-catching title, \u201cYo Decido\u201d (I decide) \u2013 explaining how Latinos were going to pick the next president. Newspapers, websites, and television networks \u2013 supported financially by advertisers who wanted to tap into Latino consumers and the $1.2 trillion they spend annually \u2013 did special reports on the power of the Latino vote. The concept of Latino voting power was easy to sell. Latinos bought it so they could feel powerful, and non-Latinos bought it because many of them already feel powerless anyway due to changing demographics. There\u2019s only one problem with the storyline: It may not be true. Latino voters could wind up with very little power at all. I don\u2019t mean that their votes won\u2019t count, or that they might not help decide the outcome in a few close states \u2013 namely Colorado, Florida and Nevada. That might well happen. What I mean is that, in a broader sense, Latinos can be forgiven for feeling utterly powerless this year. It\u2019s been a tough campaign for them. They\u2019ve been insulted, treated like fools, lied to, told they weren\u2019t really promised what they thought they had been, talked about behind their backs, and assured the administration is \u201cbreaking its neck\u201d to achieve immigration reform \u2013 an issue that, in reality, was put so far on the back burner that it fell off the stove. So, regardless of what happens on Tuesday, Latinos are limping into the polling booth having been accorded no respect, no influence, no power \u2013 not because of what happens that day, but because of what happened for weeks leading up to that day.

By Gustavo Valdes, CNN en Espanol Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) \u2013 t is already a historic political year for Latinos, who are expected to have a big impact on the election in key states. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney made extraordinary efforts to court the Latino vote, which included their participation at a forum organized by a Spanish-speaking television network that allowed the two to speak directly to the fastest-growing voting bloc. Even as polls show Latinos care about the same issues as the rest of the nation and say the economy, jobs, education and health care are their top concerns, immigration has been the topic that grabs headlines and one the candidates have focused on to reach Hispanics. Obama tried to redeem himself for failing to deliver on his 2008 promise to enact comprehensive immigration reform within a year of his election by granting administrative relief to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the United States illegally. Romney tried to look tough on immigration during the primary season but since has said he would not suspend the relief action and would work on an immigration reform, if elected.

A recent poll by ImpreMedia-Latino Decisions confirms that analysis, counting three quarters of Latino voters as actively engaged in the election with 14% of all Latinos saying they are actively working on getting out the vote. The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the last four years to 12.2 million or 8.7% of all voters. A new potential Latino voter turns 18 every 30 seconds. Already, one of four U.S. citizens under the age of 18 is Latino, including 48% of the youth population of Texas, Vargas said, but low voter registration among young people and new voter ID laws could dampen turnout. Clarissa Martinez, who works on civic engagement for the National Council of La Raza, cautioned that Latino voting power is held back by a lack of registration. \u201cOnce Latinos register they vote in nearly as high a numbers as anyone,\u201d she said. But a third of the entire community is not yet 18, another 23% are ineligible because their immigration status and just 14 million of the 24 million eligible Latino voters have actually registered, she said.

Arpaio denies any discrimination. In a separate matter, the U.S. Justice Department has also accused the sheriff\u2019s office of civil rights violations against Latinos. The sheriff has described the lawsuit against him and the county as politically motivated. \u201cThey\u2019re using me for the Latino vote, showing that they\u2019re doing something, taking on the sheriff over an alleged racial profiling,\u201d he  said in May. Arpaio rejected the Department of Justice\u2019s call for monitors to oversee the workings of his department. \u201cThat shows you they want to take over this office,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder this agreement with the so-called monitor, I\u2019d probably have to clear every press release before I go public, especially having to do with illegal immigration, with the Department of Justice.\u201d His remarks came after the Justice Department filed the civil lawsuit. \u201cAt its core, this is an abuse-of-power case involving a sheriff and sheriff\u2019s office that disregarded the Constitution, ignored sound police practices, compromised public safety and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez said in May. The Justice Department had delivered in December a report with findings of civil rights violations and sought to fix them through a negotiated settlement with Maricopa County and its sheriff\u2019s office. Those talks broke down in February over the county\u2019s refusal to consider any agreement that involved an independent monitor, Perez said. According to the civil complaint, the sheriff\u2019s office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against Latinos, which includes racial profiling, unlawful detention and searches, and unlawful targeting of Latinos during raids. Arpaio has denied any discrimination, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d CNN\u2019s Greg Morris contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "\u201cYe shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free\u201d \u2013 from the Bible (John 8:32), inscribed on the facade of the the University of Texas at Austin Main Building  \u2026\u201cEqual Justice Under Law\u201d \u2013 inscription above the U.S. Supreme Court Building The Supreme Court will hear a case Wednesday on race in college admissions The court ruled in a 1950 case that a minority student should be admitted to a university Both cases -- more than half a century apart -- involved the University of Texas The plantiff in 1950 was black; the plaintiff in 2012 is white Heman Marion Sweatt and Abigail Noel Fisher both wanted to attend the University of Texas at Austin. Both claimed their race was a primary reason for their rejection. Both filed civil rights lawsuits, and the Supreme Court ultimately agreed to hear their separate appeals \u2013 filed more than half a century apart. Their cases share much in common \u2013 vexing questions of competition, fairness, and demographics \u2013 and what role government should play when promoting political and social diversity. But it is the key difference between these plaintiffs \u2013 separated by three generations and a troubled road to \u201cequality\u201d \u2013 that now confronts the nation\u2019s highest court: Sweatt was black, Fisher is white. 15 Supreme Court cases that changed America As justices hear affirmative-action case, students differ on diversity Sweatt\u2019s 1950 case produced a landmark court ruling that set the stage for the eventual end of racial segregation in public facilities. Fisher\u2019s case will be heard by the justices Wednesday. The question here could come down to whether a majority on the bench believes affirmative action has run its course \u2013 no longer necessary in a country that has come far to confront its racially divisive past, a country that has a president who is African-American. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that affirmative action, at least in the case of education, is on the chopping block,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com editor. \u201cThe Supreme Court 10 years ago approved the use of race as a factor. But it\u2019s just changed. (Now-retired Justice) Sandra Day O\u2019Connor isn\u2019t there and she was the decisive vote. And the current conservative majority is just very suspicious of the use of race in government decision-making.\u201d At issue: do the flagship state universities\u2019 race-conscious admission policies violate the rights of white applicants? iReport: Should affirmative action still exist? The timing of the arguments is not lost in a presidential election year, as the justices wade gently into this divisive issue. The court and its recent rulings on health care reform and illegal immigration have ensured that the court \u2013 however it decides the Texas appeal \u2013 will be a major campaign issue. A ruling in this petition, however, will not likely be issued until at least early 2013. _______________ Fisher individually sued the state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. She claims the individualized, discretionary admission policies violate her rights, and favor African-American and Hispanic applicants over whites and Asian-Americans. The state of Texas provides for a hybrid admission policy: automatic acceptance to its university\u2019s main campus in Austin for in-state students finishing in the top 10% of their high schools, ensuring a measure of nonsubjective diversity. Three-fourths of the in-state student body gets in this way. Fisher just missed that opportunity, so had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school. It is that a selection process that is before the court. \u201cIf any state action should respect racial equality, it is university admissions,\u201d she and her lawyers told the high court in their written brief. \u201cSelecting those who will benefit from the limited places available at universities has enormous consequences.\u201d Supreme Court possibilities if Romney wins election The school, with a large 52,000 student body, defends its \u201cholistic\u201d policy of considering race as one of many factors \u2013 including test scores, community service, leadership and work experience \u2013 designed to create a diverse campus. \u201cWe must have the flexibility to consider each applicant\u2019s unique experiences and background so we can provide the best environment in which to educate and train the students who will be our nation\u2019s future leaders,\u201d said school administrators. The Obama administration agrees, and is backing the school, saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders \u201cwho possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the United States.\u201d The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is among more than five dozen outside groups filing legal briefs in support of the school. Many of them worry the conservative high court majority is poised to strike down or severely limit affirmative action. \u201cA broad ruling could have very far reaching effects, and could possibly affect the pathway to opportunity for minority students at a range of universities,\u201d said Debo Adegbile, the group\u2019s acting president. \u201cNot just at state universities, but at all institutions of higher education.\u201d But groups opposed to the state\u2019s policies think the time has come to rethink how affirmative action will be applied in the future, if at all. \u201cUsing race in admissions decisions, to achieve diversity, amounts to stereotyping people by their race,\u201d said Joshua Thompson of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed a legal brief in support of Fisher. \u201cRacial diversity in a student body does not guarantee a diversity of experience and perspectives. It is unrealistic and wrong to try to pigeonhole people by their race.\u201d ______________ A larger social debate is whether race-conscious policies serve their ultimate purpose \u2013 to help minority students achieve success, especially in high-profile professional positions. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is affirmative action is backfiring quite badly,\u201d said Gail Heriot, a law professor at the University of San Diego and a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She and two fellow commission members filed a brief, citing recent studies that race preferences are doing more harm than good, and suggesting there are fewer African-American professionals than would have been with race-neutral methods. \u201cThe problem is what is called mismatch,\u201d said Heriot. \u201cAs a result of affirmative action, black students in particular, Hispanic students as well, are likely to go to a school where their entering credentials put them towards the bottom of the entering class,\u201d at top schools like Harvard or Texas. Their lower grades as a result, said Heriot, mean those students are much more likely to give up on the ambition to major in science, or go into medicine or the law. Supreme Court possibilities if Obama is reelected \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cIf only the students would go to the school where their entering credentials are pretty much in the middle or towards the top of that particular college.\u201d Many social scientists and civil groups, including the NAACP, reject that analysis. \u201cI think those studies and arguments don\u2019t really jive with the real world,\u201d said Adegbile. \u201cThe admissions officers are best situated to make the determination and some of the tradeoffs, to have a mix of students that can accomplish all of the things that college and universities are engines to do.\u201d ________________ The high court has had an evolving record on the discretion of state officials to decide who attends their institutions. The justices in 2003 said state universities can narrowly tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant\u2019s race, to achieve a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students. But they reaffirmed existing limits \u2013 bans on the use of quotas, extra \u201crace\u201d points in selective criteria, or \u201cbalancing\u201d measures to reflect the larger population. That landmark case from the University of Michigan is the subject of current but separate appeals over a state ballot measure designed to eliminate any racial criteria. A divided federal appeals court last year concluded the voter-approved ban on \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d at public colleges and universities was unconstitutional, and \u201calters Michigan\u2019s political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities.\u201d The Texas case is complicated over the issue of \u201cstanding\u201d and whether Fisher should even be allowed to bring her lawsuit. She graduated this spring from Louisiana State University, where she went after being rejected by the University of Texas \u2013 and school officials had argued she has no \u201clive\u201d controversy or claim necessary for the high court to intervene. They said her only \u201charm\u201d would be trying to recoup nonrefundable application fees. Through her lawyers, Fisher said she did not want to be interviewed by CNN. In accepting the case, the high court made no mention of whether the standing issue would affect its ultimate ruling. The court also announced Justice Elena Kagan will not participate in the case since she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration\u2019s solicitor general before joining the high court. That leaves the possibility of a 4-4 ruling, meaning Fisher would not prevail, and leaving undecided the larger constitutional questions presented. Fisher\u2019s attorneys made the strategic decision to sue as an individual instead of bringing a class-action discrimination claim, which would have made it easier in some respects. A co-plaintiff, Rachel Michalewicz, dropped out of the suit last year. The university proudly touts its diversity: the latest freshman class is about 46% white, 25% Hispanic, 18% Asian, and 5% black. Opinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it _________________ The Michigan case was divisive in 2003, with Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor the swing vote. \u201cIn order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThe (Michigan) Law School\u2019s educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer.\u201d But she left the bench in 2006, replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, who is expected to strongly question the Texas policy. Justice Clarence Thomas was among four conservative justices who found the Michigan policies unconstitutional. \u201cThe Law School, of its own choosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy.\u201d Despite that high court ruling, some states, including California, do not allow race considerations in college admissions. The issue now before an arguably more conservative high court is whether the Texas policies should be re-evaluated, as states have had nearly a decade to re-evaluate such diversity considerations. The young woman at the center of the challenge _____________ A final word about Sweatt. When the Houston mailman applied to the University of Texas in 1946, no African-American at the time could be admitted to any law school in the state, and there were even no black-only law schools. So a purported \u201cseparate-but-equal\u201d government policy was in fact \u201cseparate and non-existent.\u201d School administrators cited the established white-only policies for their rejection \u2013 \u201cTexas\u2019 wise and long-continued policy of segregation,\u201d in the state attorney general\u2019s words \u2013 and instead offered Sweatt an out-of-state scholarship. He refused and took his case to court. By that time the state had agreed to create a blacks-only School of Law of the Texas State University for Negroes \u2013 in Houston, not Austin \u2013 but its implementation was delayed for many months. The high court unanimously found in favor of Sweatt \u2013 concluding the separate school for a variety of quantitative and intangible reasons lacked \u201csubstantive equality.\u201d He became the first African-American ever ordered admitted to an all-white institution. His legal victory was an important landmark \u2013 a building block that culminated three years later in the 1953 Brown v. Board case, where the justices ordered a permanent end to state-mandated public, racial segregation. Sweatt\u2019s personal victory was bittersweet. He entered the UT law school, but later dropped out, following ill health as well as hostility from white classmates. He died in 1982, and the Travis County civil courthouse in Austin was renamed in his honor. The current case is Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (11-345).

Rodriguez, CNN \u201c\u00a1Si se puede!\u201d Many people may not realize that the origin of \u201cYes We Can!\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign slogan, was a direct translation of rallying cries of the farm workers movement led by C\u00e9sar\u00a0E. Ch\u00e1vez, founder of the United Farm Workers, an organization devoted to defending the rights of farmhands and field workers across the country. Opinion: Obama hits a foul by honoring Cesar Chavez Chavez fought for fair wages, humane treatment and safer working conditions for California\u2019s farm workers through nonviolent marches, boycotts and fasts. The UFW motto has been widely adopted by labor unions and civil rights movements, like the Service Employees International Union Justice For Janitors program, and immigration reform protests in 2006. The slogan was coined during Chavez\u2019s 24-day fast in 1972 for social justice in Phoenix, with the help of Dolores Huerta, co-founder of UFW. In the 1972 film\u201c\u00a1Si se puede!\u201d, filmmakers Rick Tejada-Flores and Gayanne Fietinghoff document the fast that inspired the phrase. In May 1972, the Arizona Legislature passed a bill that limited collective bargaining and outlawed boycotts and strikes at harvest time. After Gov. Jack Williams signed the bill into law, Chavez began a fast. According to the film\u2019s site, supporters discouraged the fast, arguing with him:\u201cCesar, no se puede, no se puede.\u201d Chavez would reply. \u201cSi, si se puede.\u201d Yes, it can be done. On Monday, President Obama traveled to Keene, California, to announce the C\u00e9sar\u00a0E. Ch\u00e1vez\u00a0National Monument. The 120-acre site is Chavez\u2019s former home and workplace from the early 1970s until his death in 1993. \u00a0It includes his grave site and national headquarters of the United Farm Workers. The Mexican-American farm worker, labor organizer and civil rights activist will be the first Latino honored\u00a0since the 1700s.\u00a0The event is seen as an effort to court Latino voters, with Election day just weeks away. Obama to announce Cesar Chavez monument, send message to Latinos Earlier this year, President Obama decreed March 31 as Cesar Chavez Day. The White House honored and invited 11 local leaders, activists, farm workers and professors who exemplified Cesar Chavez\u2019s core values to speak at a panel called \u201cChampions of Change\u201d for the 85th anniversary of the civil rights leader\u2019s birthday. \u00a0While not a federal holiday, grass-roots organizations continue to advocate March 31 as a national holiday. In 2008, then-Sen. Obama made a call for a national holiday\u00a0in Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s\u00a0honor.\u00a0\u201cCh\u00e1vez\u00a0left a legacy as an educator, environmentalist and a civil rights leader. And his cause lives on. As farm workers and laborers across America continue to struggle for fair treatment and fair wages, we find strength in what C\u00e9sar\u00a0Ch\u00e1vez accomplished so many years ago. And we should honor him for what he\u2019s taught us about making America a stronger, more just and more prosperous nation, \u201c Ten states mark his birthday with a holiday.\u00a0More than 40 schools, buildings and parks across the nation bear his name, along with street signs across the country.

Soledad O\u2019Brien reports in \u201cLatino in America: Courting Their Vote\u201d at 8 p.m. ET Sunday. By Cindy Y. Rodriguez, CNN (CNN) \u2013 Forty years ago, Balbino and Rosario Guevara didn\u2019t vote. It had nothing to do with Nixon\u2019s landslide or the electoral implosion of the Democratic Party; they were living in El Salvador. And they were simply afraid. \u201cI had two businesses: a restaurant and store. But then, the politics took a turn for the worse. \u2026 People, even teachers, were being kidnapped. It was terrible,\u201d Balbino Guevara said. \u201cI told my wife, \u2018I don\u2019t like this. We need to leave.\u2019 \u201d The Guevaras watched helplessly as the country hurtled toward a brutal civil war. They fled to the United States in the early \u201970s, and suddenly, the ballot box became a key part of their identity. It\u2019s immigration, stupid, say Latino voters in Nevada \u201cThe first thing we did after we became U.S. citizens was go to the town hall and register to vote,\u201d Rosario Guevara said proudly in her native Spanish. \u201cAnd we have voted at every single election since.\u201d The Guevaras became naturalized citizens and embraced voting in a way that was denied their countrymen in El Salvador, hit by electoral violence and fraud and a coup amid the bloody civil war. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to vote. Very, very important,\u201d Rosario said. \u201cI always tell my two daughters to vote, but they don\u2019t listen to me.\u201d She has been voting since 1992, and her husband cast his first ballot in the following presidential election in 1996. \u201cWe even vote in our local town elections,\u201d said Rosario Guevara, who now lives in West New York, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. But that passion isn\u2019t always shared by other Latinos. Balbino Guevara believes that one reason why Latinos vote in smaller proportions to other population groups is the lingering memories of fellow immigrants of what went on in the old country. \u201cThey probably think that the voting process is going to be just like it is in our home countries. For example, in my country, I didn\u2019t vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if I did or not; they already knew who was going to win the election without my vote.\u201d The memory of life El Salvador - even though he left before the worst rampages of the government death squads and the violence that killed, by some estimates, about 75,000 people - is still enough to make Balbino shake his head and close his eyes. He couldn\u2019t wait to leave, even though it meant separation from his wife and baby daughter and having to pay a \u201ccoyote\u201d to smuggle him across the Mexican border. Rosario Guevara was able to reunite with her husband in Brooklyn, New York, a year after he left. She hadn\u2019t wanted to leave. \u201cI was 29 years old when I left. \u2026 I was very young and scared. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. We once dreamed of going back to El Salvador when we retired, but our life is here now.\u201d Back in El Salvador, Balbino, 77, was a teacher but then became a small-business owner. When he arrived in the U.S., he worked as a porter in a high-rise building in New Jersey and then as a janitor at a Jersey City hospital. Rosario, 75, was a nurse in her home country but worked as a housekeeper to get her residency. The couple had another daughter and were finally able to bring their elder child to the United States in 1979. They say they came to the U.S. for a chance at a better life. Evidence of how that life has played out is displayed on the walls of their home. In their bedroom, photos of their wedding and their granddaughter\u2019s quincea\u00f1era hang alongside their framed certificates of citizenship, his adorned with a white rosary. Come November 6, the Guevaras will be doing as they have for past election days: waking very early, picking up Rosario\u2019s brother and any others they\u2019ve persuaded to vote, and heading off to the polls. West New York \u2013 their home for 35 years \u2013 is an immigrant hub, with the third-highest percentage of Hispanics in New Jersey. About 78% of the residents are Hispanic, and they add up to 2.5% of the state\u2019s Latino population, the 2010 Census found. And the Guevaras have a message for their neighbors and any other Latino immigrants who do not vote. \u201cMaybe in your country, your vote didn\u2019t matter, but it does matter here, so you should vote,\u201d Balbino Guevara said. \u201cIt\u2019s like those people that complain about the prices of goods rising,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cWell then, you should have voted if you wanted a say.\u201d But Mitt Romney and others on the GOP ticket do not appear to have much of a chance of winning the Guevara vote, with Balbino declaring, \u201cWe always vote for the Democratic Party.\u201d CNN Poll: Obama at 70% among Latino voters",

Soledad O\u2019Brien reports \u201cLatino in America: Courting Their Vote\u201d at 8 p.m. ET Sunday. By Moni Basu, CNN (CNN) \u2013 Marlene Monteolivo was a Democrat for many years, then a Republican. Now she\u2019s registered as a nonpartisan voter in Nevada who wants to support a candidate who will make the economy better. The Colombia native, who works for a Las Vegas social services agency, says she\u2019s leaning toward GOP challenger Mitt Romney. She likes his business sensibilities. Not surprisingly, Latinos nationwide put the economy as their top priority in a CNN/ORC International poll released Tuesday. But there\u2019s a hiccup. And it\u2019s a big one called immigration. It\u2019s the 200-pound anchor on the Republican message, say experts in Nevada politics. Monteolivo doesn\u2019t like that Republicans blocked passage of the Dream Act, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She bristled at Romney\u2019s comment that 47% of Americans feel entitled to government aid. She took it to mean that Latinos, many of whom are not well off, are considered freeloaders. Come November, Monteolivo says, her option might be to \u201cvote for none of the above.\u201d Romney and President Barack Obama are vying for the attention of 268,000 eligible Latino voters in Nevada, a critical bloc in a battleground state that is still reeling from the Great Recession. Nevada leads the nation in the number of foreclosures and in the unemployment rate \u2013 12.6%. The rate among Hispanics is even worse \u2013 a dismal 14.6%. Add that to Latino disillusion with Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and Romney ought to be able to grab a chunk of Latino voters, says Carlo Maffatt, who works on Latino outreach for the Republican Party. \u201cWith the economy as bad as it is, you would think lot of people would blame Obama and say, \u2018Let me give Mitt Romney a shot,\u2019 \u201d Maffatt says. But that\u2019s not the case. In 2008, Nevada Latinos overwhelmingly voted for Obama, with whose help he handily defeated Arizona Sen. John McCain. Latinos were energized then by the promise of change in America\u2019s immigration policies. Four years later, the Dream Act \u2013 designed to create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants \u2013 is all but dead on Capitol Hill. Obama did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought to America as children. But that does not change current immigration law. \u201cYou hear Latino voices saying. \u2018Obama has not delivered,\u2019 \u201d says David Damore, a University of Las Vegas political scientist. But that disappointment is more likely to translate into a \u201clet\u2019s-just-stay-at-home\u201d attitude \u2013 as is the case with Monteolivo \u2013 instead of voting GOP, even though Romney has tried to hit home with his message in Nevada. \u201cI have walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them,\u201d Romney said in a speech in Las Vegas earlier this year. \u201cWell, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help.\u201d Tough times might be the reason why Nevada has gone from a strong Obama state in 2008 to a real battleground this time around. But it may not be enough to sway Latinos. That\u2019s because many of them \u2013 such as Monteolivo \u2013 cannot get over a widely held perception that the Republican Party\u2019s immigration policy boils down to a debate on how high to build the fence along the border, Damore says. The thinking is, he says, is that maybe we should give Romney a chance to fatten our pocketbooks but we can\u2019t take the risk with immigration. That perception has not been eased any by Republican candidates in the state. In the nasty 2010 Senate race, Republican Sharron Angle claimed her opponent, veteran Sen. Harry Reid, was too soft on illegal immigration. Latino groups expressed outrage over Angle\u2019s ads that they said were racist. They featured ominous images of a border crossing and hostile-looking Latino men; one carried an assault rifle. She also drew ire for proclaiming to Hispanic school children: \u201cSome of you look a little more Asian to me.\u201d Reid defied anti-incumbent fervor to win a fifth term in office. Post-election pundits agreed that Hispanics, 15% of Nevada\u2019s electorate, had stood unified behind Reid to save him. Since then, Nevada\u2019s Latino voters have grown in numbers. They have, after all, accounted for nearly half of the overall population growth in the state over the past 10 years. Their voting clout is sure to keep rising, and they form a voting bloc that will keep gaining national significance. That clout is even heavier in an extremely close election year in which the Silver State\u2019s six electoral votes are oh so precious. Obama can no longer count on the overwhelming support of Latinos, and Romney has yet to figure out a way to connect, says Eric Herzik of the University of Nevada at Reno. \u201cThe Latino vote may not be wild about Obama, but Romney has not shown them what he can do,\u201d says Herzik, chairman of his university\u2019s political science department. Romney\u2019s argument, says Herzik, is that everyone will be better off with lower taxes and less government regulation. \u201cThat\u2019s a very nonspecific message,\u201d Herzik says for Nevadans who are about to lose their home, lose everything. \u201cMany in Nevada are saying. \u2018I\u2019m not having a problem paying my taxes. I\u2019m having a problem paying my mortgage.\u2019 \u201c Ana Navarro: To woo Latinos, Romney needs specifics If the Republicans were able to effectively lay out their economic message, they might have a chance in getting Latinos to overlook what they see as problems in GOP immigration policy, Herzik says. Omar Lopez voted for Obama in 2008 but this year, he is still undecided. Lopez\u2019s Las Vegas residential real estate business suffered a great deal in one of the hardest-hit housing markets in the country. He downsized his staff from 12 to 3. He says the president has a competitor worth listening to. In Romney, Lopez sees a successful businessman who can perhaps solve the nation\u2019s woes. The problem is he hasn\u2019t heard specifics. Last week, he went to hear Romney\u2019s son Craig speak at the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors in hopes of hearing a solid economic recovery plan. Part of that, Lopez says, has to be an emphasis on education. \u201cWe are going to crash as a nation if we stop taking away money from education and the economy will be even worse than what it is,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cOur kids are not going to college.\u201d Nevada has the highest dropout rate among the 50 states. Only about 60% of Hispanic students in Nevada graduate from high school, according to the state of Nevada. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a specific plan for education,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cHow are we going to raise our federal budget to support school programs? How are we going to motivate our teachers?\u201d Education and the economy are huge issues for Lopez, who is raising a 5-year-old son. But immigration policy is right up there. He achieved the American dream after arriving from Colombia when he was only 21 and understands why immigration is a roadblock between Latinos and the GOP. Maffatt, the GOP outreach worker, blames it partly on what he calls a lackluster effort by the Republicans. Hands down, he admits, the Democrats have done a better job connecting with Latinos. He pointed to Obama\u2019s Las Vegas campaign appearance Sunday at the predominantly Hispanic Desert Pines High School. Sharing the stage was Mexican band Mana. Obama might as well have had U2 by his side. Obama\u2019s sixth appearance in Nevada this year hit the jackpot with Latino voters, who showed up in droves if not to see him, then the hottest rock stars south of the border. Clever move, says Maffatt, who thinks the Mana concert will help re-energize Democratic Latino voters who might have become disappointed with the president\u2019s failure to pass immigration reform. \u201cIs it the right way to present a candidate? That\u2019s debatable,\u201d Maffatt says. \u201cBut the point is they are doing something. I don\u2019t see any (GOP) resources going into Nevada.\u201d Lopez, the real-estate businessman, did not go to hear Mana. He gave his four tickets away to one of his clients. She called him up the next day crying with excitement. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she told him. \u201cI got to see the president.\u201d It\u2019s those small things, Lopez says, that might help Obama with Latinos in Nevada. As for Lopez? He\u2019ll be waiting eagerly in front of his television set Wednesday night as Obama and Romney engage in their first debate. CNN iReport: What would you ask the candidates in the first debate? Lopez be tuning in for promises on education, the economy \u2013 and immigration.",

            "article_content": "Ten immigration agents challenge the administration over halting some deportations Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin: The lawsuit has no legal standing At issue is a move to allow children of illegal immigrants to study and work in America Opponents of the policy call it backdoor amnesty Gaby Pacheco calls herself an aspiring U.S. citizen who is compiling the paperwork and trying to get the $465 needed to apply for a two-year reprieve from getting deported. James D. Doebler says his superiors at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are threatening to suspend him for putting an arrested illegal immigrant into the hearing process that could lead to deportation. The two are on opposite sides of a lawsuit filed this week by Doebler and nine other ICE agents that challenges a new Obama administration policy intended to remove the threat of deportation faced by young illegal immigrants who arrived in America as children and have good student or military records. Doebler and his fellow complainants argue the new policy on immigration law enforcement exceeds the administration\u2019s authority and puts ICE agents in the position of facing disciplinary action for doing their jobs. \u201cThey\u2019re in a position now that\u2019s just untenable,\u201d argued Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, an advocacy group for more restrictive immigration that is bankrolling the lawsuit. The goal of the lawsuit is to force a court ruling on whether the new administration policy is legal, Beck told CNN on Friday. If so, then the ICE agents are protected; and if not, the case would halt what the former journalist called a harmful influx of illegal workers at a time when young Americans are struggling to find jobs. \u201cObviously, we would not be pleased if they say this is a legal order,\u201d Beck said, adding: \u201cWe do believe strongly that the president doesn\u2019t have the right to do this.\u201d Pacheco and others reject the premise of the lawsuit, calling it a politically motivated effort to undermine the \u201cdeferred action\u201d directive by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that went into full effect last week. \u201cI think they\u2019re using this as a political plan to rally the voters in election season,\u201d said Pacheco, the political director of United We Dream, an advocacy group for young illegal immigrants like herself. A statement by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the lawsuit lacked a sound legal basis, noting that \u201cover 100 of the nation\u2019s top constitutional and immigration law scholars signed on to a letter\u201d attesting to the constitutionality of the new administration policy. Trumka\u2019s statement added that the suing agents \u201care working with some of the most anti-immigrant forces in the country; forces that have long sowed division and destruction.\u201d The agents are represented by Kris Kobach, the Republican Kansas secretary of state who worked on Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration law and is an informal adviser to presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, according to NumbersUSA. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Friday that the lawsuit lacked legal merit. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine any judge would even give them standing to file the case, much less decide it on the merits,\u201d Toobin said. \u201cI am unaware of any law that allows federal employees to challenge the legality of the actions of their superiors.\u201d Filed Thursday in federal court in Dallas, the lawsuit challenges the two-year deferred action policy of the Obama administration, as well the policy of \u201cprosecutorial discretion,\u201d in which ICE agents are supposed to focus their attention on dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants. In a nutshell, the agents involved do not want to obey the new policies and do not want to face any disciplinary actions or lawsuits if they continue to arrest any type of immigrant who is in the United States illegally. \u201cWe are federal law enforcement officers who are being ordered to break the law,\u201d said Chris Crane, one of the agents filing suit and the president of the ICE agents and officers union. \u201cThis directive puts ICE agents and officers in a horrible position.\u201d According to the lawsuit, Doebler \u201carrested an alien who was unlawfully present in the United States and issued the alien an NTA (notice to appear), contrary to the general directions of his supervisors that he should decline to issue NTAs to certain illegal aliens.\u201d \u201cPlaintiff Doebler was issued a Notice of Proposed Suspension,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cPlaintiff Doebler is facing a three-day suspension for arresting and processing the alien for a hearing rather than exercising the \u2018prosecutorial discretion\u2019 commanded by his supervisors.  Plaintiff Doebler requested a written directive ordering him not to issue the NTA.  His supervisors have refused to give him a written directive and would not sign any paperwork authorizing the use of \u2018prosecutorial discretion.\u2019 \u201c Now, the lawsuit says, Doebler \u201creasonably fears, based on his past experience, that if he follows the requirements of federal law, contrary to the \u2018Directive,\u2019 and arrests an alien or issues the alien an NTA, he will be disciplined again. He reasonably fears that a second disciplinary action will result in the loss of his job.\u201d Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, responded Thursday that the department \u201cuses prosecutorial discretion to assist in focusing vigorously on the removal of individuals who are convicted criminals, repeat immigration law violators, and recent border-crossers.\u201d In fiscal year 2011, ICE removed 216,000 criminal illegal immigrants, Chandler said, adding that it was the largest annual figure in history and an 89% increase over the administration of President George W. Bush. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals decision is a temporary measure until Congress takes action on reforming immigration policies, Chandler continued, adding that it \u201censures that responsible young people, who are Americans in every way but on paper, have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution.\u201d Pacheco, who came to America with her parents from Ecuador at the age of 8, described herself in similar terms. She graduated from Miami Dade College and now wants to get a master\u2019s degree, she said. \u201cWe speak the language. We are part of the fabric of this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my home. They are telling me that I do not belong, that I am not American.\u201d President Barack Obama made a similar point in announcing the policy change in June, calling the decision to halt deportations of people like Pacheco \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d Under the new policy, the Obama administration will give a two-year deferral from deportation to illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they are younger than 30, arrived in the country before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military. Supporters stress the plan does not grant immunity or provide a shortcut to citizenship, but instead affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers while removing the threat of deportation for two years. Opponents say the policy amounts to granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to America illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young Americans. As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. The deferred deportation policy includes some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that failed to win enough Republican support to become law. Obama made clear that the new policy was intended to be a temporary step until Congress passes a more comprehensive immigration law that addresses the situation of young illegal immigrants who have essentially grown up as Americans. Beck called such an approach misguided. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s not allowed by law in order to get Congress to pass something which they have defeated repeatedly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an abuse of power.\u201d His group raised $100,000 for the lawsuit Thursday, Beck said, adding that he expected the case to cost \u201ca few hundred thousand dollars.\u201d \u201cIf it goes to the Supreme Court, who knows?\u201d he added.

Her documentary \u201cDivided We Fall\u201d examines hate crimes against Sikh Americans after September 11. Kaur studied religion and law at Stanford University, Harvard Divinity School and Yale Law School, where she now directs the Yale Visual Law Project. Follow her on Twitter: @valariekaur. By\u00a0Valarie Kaur, Special to CNN I have spent the past two weeks documenting the aftermath of what could be one of the deadliest racially motivated mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Through a camera lens, I\u2019ve witnessed courage in the face of profound grief: families in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, mourning the dead, praying through tears and rebuilding their community in the Sikh spirit of chardi kala, a rising resilience even in darkness. But when family members walked out of a private meeting with first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday afternoon, I saw something entirely new in their faces. For the first time, I saw them smile. The first lady met privately with the families at Oak Creek High School, a few blocks from the Sikh gurdwara (house of worship) where a gunman opened fire August 5, killing six people and hospitalizing three more. The visit was more than symbolic; it was exemplary. First lady meets with victims of Sikh temple shooting Obama did not arrive with prepared speeches or prescriptions. Rather, she drew close to Sikh American families and listened to what is at stake: their ability to live, work and worship without fear. For Sikh Americans who have felt somewhat abandoned when the national attention dissipated a few days after the tragedy \u2013 and disappointed that President Obama did not\u00a0immediately\u00a0come to Oak Creek \u2013 the meeting has generated a wellspring of hope and healing. \u201cMichelle Obama didn\u2019t just grieve with us,\u201d said Kamal Singh, whose mother, Paramjit Kaur, was killed in the massacre. \u201cShe spent time with each family in turn, asking questions and listening to our pain and hope.\u201d \u201cShe told me that my father was a hero,\u201d said Amardeep Kaleka, whose father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, died fighting the gunman. \u201cThat meant a lot to me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really glad that the first lady came,\u201d said 18-year old Harpreet Singh, Kamal\u2019s younger brother. \u201cI want to go into law enforcement to protect people and fulfill my mother\u2019s dream, but I don\u2019t want to give up my pagri (turban).\u201d Harpreet wears a turban in the Sikh tradition to represent devotion to God and commitment to service, but most turbaned Sikhs are barred from serving in the U.S. military and many law enforcement agencies. \u201cThe first lady said that she would work on this for me, and I was shocked,\u201d Harpreet said, smiling. \u201cShe said that maybe one day I could become Secret Service and protect her!\u201d Harpreet is one of thousands of Sikh Americans whose struggle for civil rights and human dignity makes the future uncertain. Sustained second-class treatment compromises anyone\u2019s dreams. For Sikhs, the Oak Creek massacre was not random, indiscriminate or senseless as it was in Aurora, Virginia Tech or Columbine. It is the most recent tragedy in a long history of discrimination\u00a0and violence Sikhs have faced in the past decade and long before. Sikh Americans want the tragedy in Oak Creek to serve as an alarm bell to end discrimination, not just against our community but against all communities. Sikhs speak about long-held fears in their community The gunman in Oak Creek was the product of homegrown hate. His hate happened to find expression at a Sikh gurdwara near Milwaukee. Tomorrow, it could be a mosque, a synagogue, a church or a secular humanist society in any city in America. It is the hate that we need to end and the healing that we have to begin. And that healing requires deep listening and open storytelling. We as Americans should follow the first lady\u2019s example. In a sputtering economy and polarized election season, we must do more than debate gun control to prevent another Oak Creek. We must ignite a national conversation about how to combat hate and build community in America. As we prepare for the 11th anniversary of September 11, we have an opportunity to listen deeply and discover bold new ways forward. Campuses can host film screenings and panel discussions, congregations can step up interfaith engagement, corporations can hold roundtable discussions, media can provide platforms for more voices, and government bodies can host town halls for public storytelling. Remembering the victims To be sure, we need more than storytelling alone. We need to wield our stories strategically in the courtroom, on the airwaves and online to challenge institutions of power. We need the federal government to track anti-Sikh hate crimes, allow turbaned Sikhs into the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies, and end racial profiling in immigration, national security and criminal arenas. We need educational institutions to expand curricula, workplaces to end discriminatory policies and political groups to call out anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim rhetoric. But all of these efforts depend on us coming together to listen, share stories and use them to apply collective pressure on legal and political institutions. Stories can be the starting point for action. \u201cOur parents were just grateful the flags were lowered to half-mast,\u201d said Sandeep Khattra, granddaughter of Suveg Singh, who was killed in the attack. \u201cWe grew up in this country, so we wanted more: We wanted to be heard. The first lady\u2019s visit feels like the first step.\u201d During the visit with Obama, young people who lost their family in the Oak Creek massacre, including Sandeep, Kamal, Harpreet and Amardeep, presented the first lady with a gift: a simple orange wristband with the words \u201cI Pledge Unity. August 5, 2012.\u201d The first lady pulled up a chair after meeting each family and said, as the youth remember it: \u201cWe have much work to do as a nation. I\u2019m ready to do my part.\u201d Let\u2019s follow her lead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Valarie Kaur.",

Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette. By Ruben Navarrette Jr., CNN Contributor San Diego (CNN)\u00a0\u2013 Immigration groups, Obama surrogates, the media and the Democratic Party have a message for Latino voters, who some say could swing the election because they are heavily represented in four battleground states \u2013 Colorado, Nevada, Florida and New Mexico. Here\u2019s\u00a0the message: Vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan is anti-Latino, and his immigration views are simplistic, intolerant and punitive. Really? Someone should tell that to the anti-immigrant group NumbersUSA, which advocates not only an end to illegal immigration (and there is nothing wrong with that) but\u00a0also a dramatic reduction in legal immigration to pre-1965 levels\u00a0(there is a lot wrong with that). It is the views of groups such as this \u2013 which sadly have a lot of influence on the Republican Party \u2013 that can genuinely be called simplistic, intolerant and punitive. So why does NumbersUSA list\u00a0Ryan\u2019s \u201ccareer grade\u201d\u00a0in Congress as a \u201cC\u201d? Ryan\u2019s grade puts him in the bottom 10% of all current Republican members of Congress, according to Roy Beck, the group\u2019s founder and CEO. The nicest thing that Beck could find to say about Ryan after the congressman from Wisconsin joined the GOP ticket was that Ryan \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have put a lot of thought into immigration policy and doesn\u2019t seem to have deep ideological reasons for his poor immigration record.\u201d Wow.

Ten ICE agents filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Dallas against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and ICE Director John Morton. The organization NumbersUSA, with it\u2019s self-proclaimed stance of \u201cfor lower immigration,\u201d quickly claimed a stake in the suit, saying on its website that it was \u201cfinancing the effort\u201d of the agents\u2019 suit. NumbersUSA also emphasized on its site that Kris Kobach, the Republican Kansas secretary of state who worked on Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration law and is an informal adviser to presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, is representing the suing agents. The suit cites Obama administration decisions to allow young people brought to the U.S. before the age of 16 who meet certain criteria to apply for a two-year relief period in which they couldn\u2019t be deported. The complaint also objects to the policy of \u201cprosecutorial discretion,\u201d in which ICE agents are supposed to focus their attention on dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants. In a nutshell, the agents do not want to obey the new policies and do not want to face any disciplinary actions or lawsuits if they continue to arrest any type of immigrant who is in the United States illegally. Undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation \u201cWe are federal law enforcement officers who are being ordered to break the law.  This directive puts ICE agents and officers in a horrible position,\u201d Chris Crane, one of the agents filing suit and the president of the ICE agents and oficers union, said, according to a news release posted on the NumbersUSA said. Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, responded, \u201cDHS uses prosecutorial discretion to assist in focusing vigorously on the removal of individuals who are convicted criminals, repeat immigration law violators, and recent border-crossers.\u201d Chandler said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals decision is a temporary measure until Congress takes action on reforming immigration policies and that it \u201censures that responsible young people, who are Americans in every way but on paper, have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution.\u201d The DHS spokesman also said that in fiscal year 2011 ICE removed 216,000 criminal illegal immigrants, a figure Chandler said is the largest in history and an 89% increase over the administration of President George W. Bush. The Obama administration announced in June it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements. Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation, Supporters stress it does not grant immunity or a provide a shortcut to citizenship but affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers \u2013 with a promise they won\u2019t be deported for two years. Opponents see the policy as granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to America illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young Americans. As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. The deferred deportation policy includes some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that failed to win enough Republican support to become law. In this year\u2019s presidential election, Latino votes are critical in several battleground states, including Florida and Nevada. On Thursday, several members of Congress came out in support of the ICE agents\u2019 suit. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the administration\u2019s policies are \u201chaving a very negative effect on our immigration law enforcement officers\u2019 ability to secure America\u2019s border and defend the rule of law.\u201d Undocumented students in their own words \u201cICE agents should enforce our immigration laws and apprehend illegal immigrants,\u201d said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cBut the Obama administration makes it impossible for ICE agents to do their jobs.\u201d Five things to know about the big change in immigration policy Court blocks provisions in immigration laws, lets some controversial ones stand CNN\u2019s Bill Mears contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Attorney for Arizona says authorities are \"trying to deal with illegal immigrants\" A civil rights attorney says the law \"is infected with racial discrimination\" A lawyer representing Arizona says the law does not discriminate Opponents point to e-mails from the law's author A federal judge is once again weighing arguments over the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision in Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration law. The provision was the only one of four major parts of the law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. But opponents argued in U.S. District Court on Tuesday that new evidence shows that a federal judge should block enforcement of the provision. \u201cIt is infected with racial discrimination,\u201d attorney Karen Tumlin of the National Immigration Law Center said outside the courthouse Tuesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. Court issues split decision on state laws Attorney John Bouma, representing Arizona, argued that the law does not discriminate. \u201cYou just can\u2019t say that Latinos are going to be primarily impacted and that\u2019s discriminatory,\u201d he told CNN. Immigrants show up at Gov. Brewer's door Undocumented valedictorian stays in U.S. Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Bouma told reporters, \u201cIf Hispanics happen to be the people who are the highest percentage who come across the border illegally, believe it or not, they\u2019re probably the highest percentage that will be prosecuted under the statute.\u201d The \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision allows local law enforcement, when performing other state law enforcement functions, to check on the immigration status of those people they stop for another reason. Supreme Court justices said they upheld that part because it complements existing federal policy. When it upheld the provision, the Supreme Court was careful to say that depending on how this is implemented, it could very well be overturned one day. Immigrants line up for deportation relief On Tuesday, the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union were among the groups to challenge this part of the law on what they said were new grounds. As part of their argument, they pointed to e-mails from Arizona Sen. Russell Pearce, a Republican who authored SB 1070 and then was ousted from office in a recall election in his suburban Phoenix district last year. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that they were pushing the implementation of SB 1070, and they have racially discriminatory motivations for doing so,\u201d said Alessandra Soler, executive director at the ACLU of Arizona. \u201cRace, ethnicity and stereotypes about Latinos were the driving force behind the passage of SB 1070.\u201d Attorneys representing Arizona dispute that claim. \u201cYou look at the legislative record, and there were a lot of very good legislators involved from both parties. \u2026 There was nothing in there dealing with trying to discriminate against Hispanics. They were talking about illegal immigrants and they were trying to deal with illegal immigrants,\u201d Bouma told CNN Wednesday. Five things to know about immigration Pearce has contended that dozens of other states are trying to pass similar legislation, showing the popular support and need for such measures. In June, he said that accusations of possible racial profiling as a result of the law were \u201cdemeaning to law enforcement.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very professional, qualified law enforcement officers. .. who have been stopping people for crimes and making determinations that there\u2019s a reasonable suspicion that they were illegal,\u201d Bouma said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing that for years, and there\u2019s hardly any record of any racial profiling, and why would one suddenly suspect that they\u2019ve got to do that now?\u201d The civil rights organizations presented three new arguments against the Arizona law Tuesday, Tumlin said. The first was that the provision should be blocked because it would result in unconstitutional detainment under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Mexico has its own immigration problem The opponents of the law also argued that the provision is inappropriately motivated by race, violating equal protection laws, she said. Finally, Tumlin said, the civil rights groups presented new evidence that the provision encroaches on the federal government\u2019s responsibilities to enforce immigration laws. Attorneys representing Arizona have argued in court filings that the civil rights\u2019 organizations evidence was \u201centirely speculative\u201d and that \u201cevidence demonstrates that (the provision) can and will be implemented in a constitutional manner.\u201d In court Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton did not indicate when she would rule in the case, attorneys said.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Arizona's governor orders state agencies to bar benefits to program recipients Thousands line up at legal help centers to fill up applications The program gives those who arrived in U.S. as undocumented children the right to work It does not \"provide lawful status\" or a path to citizenship, authorities say Long lines formed at help centers and lawyers\u2019 office across America Wednesday as thousands of young, undocumented immigrants began applying for relief from deportation. They took advantage of one of the biggest immigration policy changes in years. An executive order by President Barack Obama allows those who entered the country illegally as children to remain and work without fear of deportation for at least two years. A crowd formed at Chicago\u2019s Navy Pier Wednesday to get help from  immigration lawyers and fill out forms. \u201cI was able to learn the customs and traditions, and I am used to living the life here,\u201d Nayeli Manzano, 16, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. She arrived in the United States as a child from Mexico and said she is very much American. Faces of hope: Lining up for two more years in the U.S. Undocumented youth clash with governor 'DREAM Act kid' seeks better future College junior applies for legal status FAIR pres: Obama rewrote immigration law \u201cI feel I am a citizen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing that is stopping me is a little piece of paper.\u201d Tuesday, at a Latino community center in New York, Maria, a young Chilean, leaped from her seat. \u201cI\u2019ve found the form!\u201d she screamed. She was with a number of other undocumented immigrants meeting there to get legal advice in anticipation of the release of the form, which authorities surprisingly posted a day before they had said they would. The form, titled \u201cConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\u201d was dated August 15, 2012, and bore the expiration date of February 28, 2013. Maria started filling it out immediately, telling a reporter she was too afraid to divulge her last name or details of her childhood trek to the United States, but would feel differently once the form had been processed and her status ensured. Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said applicants who have not committed major crimes can apply without fear of deportation. The forms were made available two months after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that people who arrived in the United States as children may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years subject to renewal, and upon approval would be eligible for work authorization. As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. Dubbed Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the deferral program was created in June under an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. However, there is no guarantee of its future if Obama is not re-elected. Republican Mitt Romney would then have the power to revoke the order. The program also does not guarantee public benefits to successful applicants. That allowed Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to issue an executive order Wednesday directing state agencies to deny benefits \u2013 including driver\u2019s licenses \u2013 to deferred action recipients. \u201cThe program does not provide for any additional public benefit to unlawfully present aliens beyond the delayed enforcement of United States immigration laws and the possible provision of employment authorization,\u201d the executive order states. It says granting public benefits to deferred action recipients would have \u201csignificant and lasting impacts\u201d on Arizona\u2019s budget, health care system and other taxpayer-funded benefits. Brewer\u2019s order drew immediate criticism from supporters of immigration reform and the DREAM Act, which would offer temporary legal status to young illegal immigrants who have graduated high school and want to attend college or join the military. Eventually, they could obtain permanent residency or citizenship. \u201cGov. Brewer is directly attacking children and immigrant youth, who with no fault of their own, were brought to the United States,\u201d said the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition. The group organized a march to the State Capitol on Wednesday, carrying a large banner reading \u201cDREAM Act Now.\u201d When he signed the deferred action order, Obama said the changes would make immigration policy \u201cmore fair, more efficient and more just.\u201d Undocumented students in their own words The shift on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy elicited praise from Latino leaders, while Republicans reacted with outrage, saying the move amounts to amnesty \u2013 a negative buzzword among conservatives \u2013 and usurps congressional authority. \u201cThis is not amnesty,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It\u2019s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure.\u201d Mayorkas reiterated Tuesday that deferred action does not provide lawful status or a shortcut to permanent residency or citizenship. A $465 application fee will fund the administrative costs of the program, including a biometric check and the issuance of a secure work-authorization document, he said. Each request will be examined for possible fraud, he added. Ana Ramirez said her parents brought her and her sister, Juana, to the United States without any documentation many years ago when they were just toddlers. They were filling out the paperwork for the deferred action program in suburban Atlanta. I didn\u2019t have a choice to come here,\u201d Juana Ramirez said. Lawyer Charles Kuck said the young immigrants just want a chance at life without fear of deportation. \u201cThey are getting two things out of this program: one, a promise they won\u2019t be deported for two years and, two, a work permit,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cIn exchange, the federal government is getting a million or more kids coming forward, give their biographical information and that of their whole family and give their pictures.\u201d He urged anyone applying to do so with the help of a lawyer. \u201cThe government has said quite clearly: There will be no appeals. There will be no motions to reopen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get one bite at this apple.\u201d In announcing the program, Obama noted that children of illegal immigrants \u201cstudy in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag. It makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans.\u201d The president declared that the policy change is \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d Under the new policy, people 30 and younger who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, can get a two-year deferral from deportation and apply for work permits. Participants must prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. The change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, Napolitano said. The move addresses a concern of the Latino community and includes some of the provisions of the DREAM Act, which failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval. The name is an acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors. Obama has been criticized by Latino leaders for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency\u2019s history. Obama and Napolitano have called for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country. Republicans who blocked Democratic efforts to change immigration laws have condemned the move, with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a GOP foe of Democratic proposals on immigration, threatened in June to sue to stop Obama \u201cfrom implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy.\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has called the decision \u201ca classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,\u201d while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has called the change a \u201cdecision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants.\u201d Others predicted the move will tighten an already poor job market for young Americans. However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, said it \u201cwill give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they\u2019ve ever called home.\u201d Presumed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said in June that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order, which can be replaced by a subsequent president. As president, Romney said, he would seek to provide \u201ccertainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents.\u201d Latinos make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election. A spokeswoman for a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza, hailed the administration\u2019s move. \u201cIn light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time,\u201d NCLR spokeswoman Laura Vazquez said in June.

            "article_content": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests Wednesday for consideration of deferred action for young undocumented immigrants who arrived in America as children. Here are five things you should know about the bold change announced by President Barack Obama in June: 1. What is it? The policy is a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure that allows eligible immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation deferral for a two-year period. Supporters stress it does not grant immunity or a provide a shortcut to citizenship but affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers \u2013 with a promise they won\u2019t be deported for two years. Opponents see the policy as granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to America illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young Americans. Faces of hope: Lining up for two more years in the U.S. 2. Who is eligible? College junior applies for legal status Critic: Obama rewrote immigration law Immigrants' high hopes on Obama policy As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. To be eligible to apply, you must have arrived in America when you were 16 or younger and must be 30 or under now. You must also have lived continuously in the United States for five years and must be currently in school or already graduated from high school or have served in the military. You cannot apply if you have been convicted of a felony or major misdemeanor. Opinion: Let young immigrants stay 3. What does it cost? The application fee is $465, which funds the administrative costs of the program, including a biometric check and the issuance of a secure work-authorization document. 4. Is there a risk? Homeland Security officials have assured people that information in applications will be confidential and will not be used to round up other undocumented people. Immigration lawyers are advising applicants to inform themselves before making a decision. The measure requires a renewal in two years, but there is no guarantee the policy will still be around then. It\u2019s an executive order, not law, and if Mitt Romney wins the presidential election, he will have the power to revoke it. 5. Is it political? The deferred deportation policy addresses a great concern of the Latino community and includes some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that failed to win enough Republican support to become law. In this year\u2019s presidential election, Latino votes are critical in several battleground states, including Florida and Nevada. Undocumented students in their own words",

            "article_content": "This was not amnesty or a fast track to citizenship But deportation deferral allows young undocumented immigrants to stay, work in the U.S. Many said they were brought here as babies and did not have a choice Some worried about divulging information to authorities They wanted to take the chance while they have it. The chance, they said, to live a life without fear. So they lined up Wednesday at lawyers\u2019 offices and immigration help centers to complete  deferred deportation applications posted online the day before. This was not amnesty or immunity. Nor was it a shortcut to citizenship or a permanent fix to their  status: each was illegally in America. But they had hope in their hearts they would be allowed to stay in the country they knew as their own. That they could emerge from the shadows. Ana Laura, 20, and Juana Ramirez, 23, filled out their form at Atlanta attorney Charles Kuck\u2019s suburban office. Their parents brought them to the United States from the Mexican state of Michoacan many years ago. They were just toddlers. And they were without any documentation. Face of hope: Lining up to spend two more years in the U.S. They finished high school in Chicago and moved to Georgia three years ago, where they get by working odd jobs here and there. They consider themselves U.S. citizens. Only, they\u2019re not. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice to come here. I have done nothing bad here,\u201d Juana said. On this day, when a bold new immigration policy change went into effect, the Ramirez sisters dared to dream and found themselves tempering their emotions. \u201cI\u2019m scared to get my hopes up,\u201d Ana said. Scared perhaps because there are no guarantees that come attached to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order signed in June. It allows undocumented immigrants under 30 who were brought to the United States as children to apply for a temporary deferral of deportation if they are in school or have finished school. It allows them to obtain work permits and gives them protection that they won\u2019t be deported in the next two years. After that, Obama would need to sign a new order, unless legislation known as the DREAM Act, which has similar provisions, is made into law by then. If Obama loses the November election, there is no guarantee that such a policy would be in place in two years, when all applicants have to renew. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service has assured prospective applicants that their information will remain confidential and will not be used to round up other undocumented family members. Still, the risks made some stop to wonder. David Hernandez, 17,  was one. He and his brother Daniel, 15, listened carefully to Kuck as he detailed the program. The brothers arrived in the United States on tourist visas 15 years ago. Like the Ramirez sisters, they were toddlers \u2013  David was 3 and Daniel just 1. Their mother, Salima Hernandez, wanted education and a better future for her children. She said she didn\u2019t worry about their legal status until she learned that they would not be able to continue their education without a government-issued ID or Social Security number. David, now a senior in high school, and Daniel, a freshman, say they were not aware of their status until a couple of years ago, when they began to make plans for college. \u201cI felt that after high school I didn\u2019t have anywhere to go,\u201d David said. \u201cI felt that if it was not something coming up soon I would end up back in Mexico.\u201d Relief from deportation Yes, he was concerned about revealing his status to federal authorities. They would know now who he was and how to find him. But it was worth it. \u201cWhatever comes in the future is better than three months ago,\u201d he said. The night before in Houston, thousands of people flocked to the consulates of Mexico and El Salvador to obtain passports and other identification documents from their home countries,  CNN affiliate KHOU-TV reported. The line wrapped around the building on 4506 Caroline Street, home of the Mexican consulate. Nelly Hernanez said she\u2019d been waiting a lifetime for this. What was a few hours more? \u201cI\u2019ve been raised here since I was four, so I\u2019ve been waiting for this day for a very long time. So it is worth it,\u201d she told KHOU. Roger Tamez wanted to finally get a driver\u2019s license, go back to school. Maybe play football. So many dreams in that one line. There were dreams, too, floating in the swelling crowd at the offices of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. The immigrant rights group expected about 1,000 people to show up Wednesday. It\u2019s estimated that just in the Los Angeles school district alone, 218,000 young immigrants are eligible to apply. Obama\u2019s executive order brought thousands relief but many are painfully aware of their sharpest critics who say deferred deportations and the DREAM Act are a form of backdoor amnesty. What also cuts, they said, are charges that illegal immigrants will take jobs away from rightful Americans. Everyone has an opinion, said Martin Bustos, 23, who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 11. But standing in line Wednesday, Bustos offered this thought: there were some jobs that most people don\u2019t want but immigrants are willing to take. And that immigrants work just as hard. \u201cWe are like everyone else too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are human. We have families.\u201d In New York, Antonio Alarcon, 17, just finished high school. He flipped through the form and spoke of how the six years he has been here has transformed. He feels much more American now than Mexican. \u201cI work hard. I pay taxes. I have a lot to contribute,\u201d he said. He hoped his deportation deferment application would be processed quickly so he can see his parents again. They felt worn down by the economic downturn and the stress of their illegal status and finally went back to Mexico this year. They were not there to see their son stand on a stage and graduate at the top of his class. Alarcon hoped that the next time he saw his mother and father, he would be enrolled in college. It was another dream that the immigration policy change could help come true.

It\u2019s not a permanent fix,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is a temporary stopgap measure.\u201d Noting children of illegal immigrants \u201cstudy in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag,\u201d Obama said, \u201cit makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans.\u201d The president declared that the policy change is \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, can get a two-year deferral from deportation and apply for work permits. Participants must prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. The change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, Napolitano said. The move addresses a concern of the Latino community and includes some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval. Obama has been criticized by Latino leaders for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency\u2019s history. Obama and Napolitano have called for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country. Republicans who blocked Democratic efforts to change immigration laws have condemned the move, with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a GOP foe of Democratic proposals on immigration, threatened in June to sue to stop Obama \u201cfrom implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy.\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has called the decision \u201ca classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,\u201d while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has called the change a \u201cdecision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants.\u201d Others predicted the move will tighten an already poor job market for young Americans. However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, said it \u201cwill give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they\u2019ve ever called home.\u201d Presumed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said in June that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order, which can be replaced by a subsequent president. As president, Romney said, he would seek to provide \u201ccertainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents.\u201d Latinos make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election. A spokeswoman for a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza, hailed the administration\u2019s move. \u201cIn light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time,\u201d NCLR spokeswoman Laura Vazquez said in June.",

            "article_content": "U.S. officials announce some details of policy change on young illegal immigrants Requests for two-year deferrals of deportation can be submitted starting August 15 Applicants also must apply simultaneously for an employment authorization card The information won't be used for immigration enforcement except in specific cases Young illegal immigrants can start applying on August 15 for two-year deferrals from deportation, but will have to pay $465 in fees, a top immigration official announced Friday. The announcement provided the first details of the Obama administration\u2019s policy change announced June 15 that provides some illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children a path to an employment authorization card without fear of getting deported. Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation as well as an employment authorization card. Participants must be able to prove they have lived continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007 \u2013 five years before the change was announced \u2013 and must have entered the country without inspection or had their lawful immigration status expire. Young immigrants prepare for new U.S. deportation policy Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the application process will include providing biometric information and undergoing a background check. Applicants who commit fraud in the application process, pose a security threat or have been convicted of serious crimes will be ineligible and subject to prosecution, he said. In all other cases, according to Mayorkas, information submitted in the application process will not be used for immigration enforcement. A senior administration official told reporters on background that the goal is to maximize participation by eligible young illegal immigrants, so a strong privacy policy is important. Other details announced Friday made clear that while successful applicants would avoid deportation for two years, there is no mechanism involved that would speed up or ease their path to full citizenship. Conservative critics of the new policy said it amounted to a \u201cbackdoor\u201d amnesty by the Obama administration to appease Hispanic supporters angered by the lack of comprehensive immigration reform since the president took office. The policy change was in essence an administrative step to mimic some provisions of the DREAM Act backed by Obama and Democrats that was blocked by Republicans in Congress. Opinion: Indiana gets real on immigration In announcing the change on June 15, Obama said it will make immigration policy \u201cmore fair, more efficient and more just.\u201d Noting children of illegal immigrants \u201cstudy in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag,\u201d Obama said that \u201cit makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans.\u201d However, Obama and other administration officials said Congress still needs to pass the DREAM Act and tackle immigration reform because the policy change in June was designed to address an immediate need, rather than be a permanent solution. The change was part of a Department of Homeland Security effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a serious threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, officials say. By halting deportations of younger immigrants who pose no threat, the department hopes to unclog a backlog of 300,000 immigration cases. In addition, the election-year move was widely praised by Hispanic-American leaders, many of whom previously criticized Obama for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens since he took office. In 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency\u2019s history. The Hispanic-American vote is vital to Obama\u2019s chances for winning re-election in November. In the conference call Friday with reporters, the senior administration official said the fees charged for applications are intended to cover the cost of implementing the policy change. No general fee waiver exists, but an exemption may be granted in exceptional cases, such as homelessness or disabilities, the official said. The official also warned people that applications will only be accepted starting August 15, and warned that anyone who offers to expedite the process or start it earlier would be unauthorized and likely running a scam.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sayu Bhojwani is the former Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs for New York City and the founding director of The New American Leaders Project. She is also a PhD candidate in Politics and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Born in India, and raised in Belize, Sayu is a naturalized citizen of the United States. By Sayu Bhojwani, Special to CNN (CNN) In this election year, the narratives of immigration and immigrants are familiar. At the national level, the Latino and the Asian American vote are scrutinized by pundits and coveted by the presidential candidates.\u00a0 At the state and local level, the role of immigrants\u2019 effect on local economies and contribution to population growth is now commonplace conversation, by immigration opponents and proponents alike.\u00a0 The 2010 Census and a new report, however, shine light on a new phenomenon \u2013 the increasing number of immigrants in America\u2019s suburbs, an important confirmation of the visible changes many Americans have been witnessing over the last decade, as our schools, towns and workplaces diversify, and the positive outcomes that such diversity can produce in politics and policy at the local, state, and national levels. In assessing the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the US, the study identifies four types of suburbs\u2014diverse, predominantly non-white, predominantly white, and exurbs. Among these, racially diverse and integrated suburbs\u2014where 20 to 60 percent of the residents are people of color, and where 53 million Americans live\u2014have experienced a number of positive electoral and policy outcomes and are, as Myron Orfield and Thomas Luce put it, \u201cat the cutting edge of racial, ethnic, and\u2026political change in America.\u201d These suburbs are reflective of the new America\u2014diverse, dynamic and rich with possibility. The demographics of these communities can lead to greater political participation, cross-ethnic coalition building, and a coordinated policy agenda. Diverse suburbs are the most likely to have an even number of Democratic and Republican voters and competitive elections. This partisan heterogeneity increases the likelihood that voters will participate, given the importance of their turnout in an election. Research by James Gimpel and others has shown that partisan heterogeneity also increases the likelihood of civic engagement by young people, who feel a greater sense of efficacy and motivation to participate when parties are competing for their votes. Diverse suburbs can also increase pan-ethnic coalition building. In a new majority America, candidates from immigrant communities are less likely to be competing only for votes from their ethnic groups, and more likely to be representing diverse jurisdictions. In his 2011 book, James Lai asserts that Asian American candidates have used suburbs as \u201cpolitical incubators,\u201d and have had success building pan-ethnic coalitions \u2013 a critical skill for minority, and all, candidates that forces them to respect diversity, a core American value. Finally, at the local level, racially diverse communities can overcome differences to unite around common policy needs in education, healthcare, open space, and other public services. Some have pointed to concerns that a more diverse America will lead to differences in priorities and resultant tensions between older, White Americans and a younger, immigrant population.\u00a0 Thus, the opportunity to organize across racial lines for a common purpose is a new and exciting possibility in our suburbs, and one that also bodes well for the future of our diverse country. For decades, immigrant communities have been drawn to urban areas, whose economic strength and cultural vitality have benefited as a result. But, suburbs, where the country\u2019s population has grown the most, are now the places to watch, not just for their economic success but also for political activity that shapes, and is shaped by, immigrant communities.\u00a0 To be a community of immigrants is a badge of pride, not just for New York City and Chicago, but also for Aurora, Illinois and the City of Lawrence, Massachusetts. Opening our arms to the opportunities that diversity brings has been a smart economic decision, but it can also be a smart political decision.

            "article_content": "NEW: The SAVE database contains alien registration numbers Florida election officials sued to gain access to a federal law enforcement database Florida wants to purge non-citizens from its voter rolls Florida officials want to use the database to challenge voter eligibility Florida election officials will have access to a federal law enforcement database to challenge the eligibility of a person to vote as part of its effort to purge non-citizens from its voting rolls, state officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security will allow state officials access to the SAVE \u2013 Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements \u2013 database in an agreement that was announced Saturday by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner and the Florida Department of State. The announcement follows weeks of legal wrangling between the federal and state officials, a fight being closely watched in Colorado, Nevada, Michigan and North Carolina \u2013 states that could ultimately swing November\u2019s presidential election \u2013 where officials are advocating for similar access. \u201cFlorida voters are counting on their state and federal governments to cooperate in a way that ensures elections are fair, beginning with ensuring the voter rolls are current and accurate,\u201d Detzner said in a statement. \u201cNow, we have a commitment to cooperate from DHS and we look forward to a partnership that improves our election process.\u201d Details of the agreement were not immediately available, and it was not clear when Florida would begin checking its voter rolls against the database, which lists those who are legally in the United States on either visas or \u201cgreen cards\u201d but not eligible to vote. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond late Saturday to a CNN request for comment. The SAVE database, which contains alien registration numbers, is a web-based service that was created to help \u201cfederal, state and local benefit-issuing agencies, institutions, and licensing bureaus determine the immigration status of benefit applicants so only those entitled to benefits receive them,\u201d according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Florida officials sued last month to gain access to the database after an effort this year to purge the state voting rolls \u2013 using driver licenses and birth dates \u2013 went awry because of faulty state records. A Florida Department of State spokesman, Chris Cate, told CNN in June that the state identified roughly 100 people who are not citizens but registered to vote. CNN found, though, that some of the names on the potential purge list were, in fact, legitimate voters \u2013 newly minted Americans recently granted citizenship. DHS and Florida struck a deal over the database just weeks after a federal judge rejected a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit aimed at preventing Florida from moving forward with a voter registration purge. Proponents of the plan say purging the rolls protects the integrity of the voting process, while critics say it targets the poor and minority voters who may be disenfranchised by the process. The poor, voting and civil rights groups say, can not afford to pay for documentation that may be required, while minorities would likely be among the groups whose voter registration records are examined. A number of states are moving to institute and tighten voter identification laws, and many are finding themselves in direct conflict with the federal government. A key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 grants the federal government open-ended oversight of states and localities \u2013 many in the South \u2013 with a history of voter discrimination. Any changes in voting laws and procedures in those pre-determined areas must be \u201cpre-cleared\u201d by Washington. Today, 32 states have in place varying degrees of voter identification laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the states with the most stringent requirements are also regions that have seen large increases in their minority population. Florida has the nation\u2019s third largest Hispanic population, behind Texas and California. CNN\u2019s Darrell Calhoun contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "By Rose Arce, CNN (CNN) \u2013 In the battle for the soccer mamis, let\u2019s just say Tuesday was a gooooooooooal for the Obama campaign. But perhaps not so great for the mamis. \u2018Soccer mamis\u2019 could affect general election The president\u2019s campaign offered up Michelle Obama to talk to CNN contributor Maria Cardona. It was live streamed on Mamiverse, a blog for Latinas and their families. The blog is where Cardona and I, along with others, contribute various perspectives. Since Latinos represent 55% of overall U.S. population growth, and their children account for nearly a quarter of new births, the Latina mama is the go-to gal for influencing Latino voters. Just ask anyone in Latino marketing or politics. Or just turn on Spanish language television, where mamis are targeted relentlessly because of their influence on everything from family decisions on health care to the type of breakfast cereal to purchase. \u201cLatinas are the ones that drive their home economy, what gets purchased, what schools their kids go to, what churches to go to,\u201d said Elaine de Valle, who edits a portal for English-dominant Hispanics called Voxxi. \u201cWhile it may be portrayed on film as a patriarchal society, it\u2019s a matriarchal society \u2026 they\u2019re looked at because of the influence they have with their family, friends and neighbors. Women share more than men, they talk about it \u2026 they share with their families.\u201d And Latinas vote in higher numbers than Latinos. Just one catch here. The Obama campaign isn\u2019t selling breakfast cereal. They\u2019re peddling a presidential candidate to a population facing 11% unemployment and a record number of deportations. This is a community that reports they are most likely\u2013more than 40% \u2013to be uninsured. There are some hard questions to ask about how the president\u2019s policies are going to improve the lives of mamis and their families. But in the Mamiverse discussion Tuesday, what the mamis got was President Barack Obama\u2019s wife being interviewed by a Democratic consultant, accompanied by a Latina from the group Latinos for Obama, a cookbook writer and two moms who shared agreement on topics such as obesity, health care and eating together as a family. \u201cDoing this can get you picked up by a lot of different places as an interview,\u201d said professor Matt Barreto, who studies race and ethnicity as a political scientist at University of Washington. \u201cBut it\u2019s really an outreach opportunity.\u201d It was an outreach opportunity that did not include Ann Romney and came on a day when presidential candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama skipped an opportunity to speak to a broad audience of Latinos at the National Council of La Raza conference. It was the first time no presidential candidate has attended. \u201cIt shocked me that they wouldn\u2019t address this crowd,\u201d said de Valle, the editor. Right after the \u201cchat\u201d, Michelle Obama was scheduled to speak at Barbara Goleman Senior High School in Miami Lakes, Florida, over the objections of local Republicans. The school is 93% Hispanic and, though school is not in session, that\u2019s a lot of potential Latino mamis in a swing state. This is clearly an opportunity for the campaigns to speak to the mami demo but not necessarily an opportunity for the mamis to speak back. \u201cIt\u2019s a market they pretty much already have so I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re speaking to the choir so much,\u201d said Elaine de Valle. \u201c\u2026 The community has a lot of overlap to other communities they want, like the middle class.\u201d CNN contributor Ana Navarro, a GOP political strategist who worked for the 2008 John McCain campaign, said these kind of outreach efforts are smart because they elicit friendly questions, not tough policy questions. \u201cMichelle Obama is a wife who is supportive of her husband. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to ask her or Ann Romney about policy,\u201d she said. Navarro thinks both campaigns would be smart to give Latinos more opportunities to get to know them as people. Either wife, she said, could tell them what these men are like, particularly Romney, who \u201cLatinos just don\u2019t feel like they know him.\u201d De Valle believes that Latinas are being fed comfort food, rather than information. \u201cThey\u2019re speaking to the converted for sure,\u201d she said. \u201cObama needs voters to get fired up, that\u2019s what today was about in Miami and the Mamiverse thing.\u201d De Valle attended the Miami school event where the first lady spoke Tuesday. In a recent poll\u00a0of Hispanics in five battleground states, respondents said immigration was the most important issue facing the Latino community that Congress and the president should address. The economy and jobs followed as issues. That same poll showed 67% of those voters approving of the job Obama is doing. In previous elections, Republicans, dating back to President George H.W. Bush, have said that getting more than 30% of the national Latino vote could be enough for them to take battleground states. President George W. Bush drew an estimated 40% of the vote in the 2004 presidential election. In the 2008 election, Obama\u2019s largest margins of victory among Latinos were in swing states such as Florida and New Jersey, according to Pew Hispanic Center. This election year, the most recent Florida poll by Latino Decisions has Obama leading Romney 53% to 37%. In 2008, Obama carried 67% of the Latino vote nationally. To win that vote, Navarro said: \u201cI think both candidates need to give some specifics on how they\u2019re going to improve the unemployment rate. I want more specifics on how they\u2019re going to address foreclosures. What are they really going to do about immigration? Romney needs to say what he is really doing, and Obama needs to explain why people should believe he\u2019s going to do anything when he didn\u2019t before.\u201d Opinion: Obama, Romney make the same mistake on Hispanics But Navarro points out that both candidates will soon have to answer some questions of their own. Obama has given interviews to major Spanish-language reporters, and she believes Romney will have to eventually as well. \u201cI don\u2019t think in 2012 you can go through a presidential campaign without sitting down with a major Hispanic journalist,\u201d she said. Latinos tweeting their issues, ideas to the top So, in our suenos, what sorts of tough questions might a mami ask of the two guys that want to rule their country? Here\u2019s one for the president that might better reflect what studies say the mamis want to know: President Obama, you have deported more people on immigration violations than any president in U.S. history. You say your administration targets illegal immigrants who were also accused of other criminal behavior, but Syracuse University\u2019s TRAC project, which crunches immigration data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, has consistently found that deportations of criminals constitute a small portion of deportations. Data shows that most people are deported solely for having entered the country without a visa. Who do you want to stay and who do you want to go? That would naturally lead to asking Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, what he means when he says he favors increasing legal immigration for talented foreigners: Gov. Romney, are you only talking about foreigners who pay steep tuitions at U.S. colleges and want to stay? Or does that include the particularly terrific caregiver or the construction or farm worker in an area short on labor? If it\u2019s the former, will white collar Americans be happy with their country giving visas to foreigners who will compete with them for jobs requiring high tech or higher education such as doctors, tech people and businessmen? Rene Alegria started the Mamiverse blog targeting mamis after doing marketing research that showed Latina moms have enormous influence over how their community makes decisions on things such as buying and core beliefs. That demographic, he says, often are family and kid focused and make big dinner-table pronouncements about political issues. So events such as the Mamiverse chat seem to offer an opportunity to give this demographic some real information. But instead, Michelle Obama assured the semicircle of sympathetic Mamiverse Latinas that \u201cBarack\u201d eats dinner with his own family and has never missed a parent-teacher conference, that \u201cthere\u2019s only one person out there right now that has a vision that we share and is going to be fighting for us every day.\u201d It isn\u2019t hard to guess who she might be talking about.",

            "article_content": "It's nearly impossible to estimate how many U.S. citizens are dual nationals, experts say Dual citizenship not recognized in U.S., but residents are not forced to choose Not all countries allow dual citizenships with the U.S., among them Japan and India Dual citizenship can create issues involving taxes, military service, same-sex marriages Irena Sharoshkina Boostani came to the United States in 1998 with $450 and few plans. After growing up in a small town in Russia, she met a Peace Corps volunteer from California who told her she should consider moving to America. As soon as she could, Boostani headed for Los Angeles. Boostani, now a 35-year-old mother of two, has dual citizenship in Russia and the United States after marrying an American citizen. \u201cThe duality is really an opportunity to bring the two homes together,\u201d said Boostani, who lives in San Diego. \u201cMy existing home is definitely America \u2013 there is no question in my mind. My mom and dad are still in Russia, and having that dual citizenship is peace of mind I can go back and forth. It feels free, it really does.\u201d It is nearly impossible to estimate how many U.S. citizens have dual \u2013 or even triple \u2013 citizenships, says Michael A. Olivas, an immigration professor at the University of Houston Law Center. It\u2019s like estimating \u201chow many people in the United States have blue eyes,\u201d he says, because there is no single registry of these individuals, and the numbers change so rapidly. The number is likely well over 1 million, he says, and is probably several times that. For those millions, the road to holding two passports is not always simple. The United States does not formally or officially recognize dual citizenship, says Daniel Cosgrove, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. During the naturalization ceremony, individuals officially become U.S. citizens when they take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. The text of the naturalization oath became regulation in 1929 and states, \u201cI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen.\u201d In practice, the naturalization oath means if naturalized citizens were ever faced with a choice of allegiance to the United States or a different nation, they have an obligation to choose the United States, says Michael Wildes, a partner in the New York-based immigration firm Wildes & Weinberg, which has represented high-profile clients including John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The understanding, Wildes says, is a U.S. citizen will \u201cwork in concert with the U.S. Constitution but never against it.\u201d Pledging allegiance There are large contingents of U.S. citizens who are also citizens of Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom, Olivas says, though dual citizens represent a host of other countries. Charles Foster, a former senior policy adviser to George W. Bush and a managing partner at FosterQuan, one of the largest immigration law firms in the United States, says he tells clients dual citizenship can be viewed as \u201ctwo for the price of one.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make an agonizing decision to give up citizenship. You can have both,\u201d he says. According to the U.S. State Department website, federal law \u201cdoes not mention dual nationality or require a person to choose one citizenship or another.\u201d It is possible to become a dual citizen in the United States in several ways, says Catherine Wilson, an associate professor of political science at Villanova University who specializes in immigration politics. These include being born in the United States to at least one immigrant parent whose home country grants the child automatic citizenship, or being born in certain countries to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen. If not a citizen by birth, people can go through the naturalization process in the United States and remain dual citizens if they are not required to renounce citizenship in their countries of origin. Issues of dual citizenship become complicated because they are unique to each country and depend on the relationship each has with the United States. Although many countries allow dual citizenship with the United States, several require renunciation of citizenship in the country of origin if an individual becomes naturalized as a U.S. citizen \u2013 a process known as forced expatriation. Those countries, according to the Migration Policy Institute, include Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Kenya, Botswana, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and India, among others. In general, it is harder to gain dual citizenship with a country the United States \u201cdoes not have a favorable relationship with, or is at war with,\u201d Wilson says. Since the founding of the United States, leaders have been concerned about Americans\u2019 political loyalty, Wilson says. There was \u201cthe concern that even people who would be our leaders would have these foreign allegiances that would lead them astray and have them sympathize on behalf of foreign powers,\u201d she says. From the time of the Constitutional Convention, the U.S. government has debated the costs and benefits of foreign allegiances. \u201cThat debate still is with us in so many ways,\u201d Wilson says. Serving abroad, and other pitfalls Complications with dual citizenship can come into play for many reasons, including when people have an obligation to join another country\u2019s military because of a religious or spiritual commitment. Ben Pester, a 20-year-old living in New Jersey, was born in Israel to American parents and has dual citizenship in those countries. He and his family moved to the United States when Pester was 13. As an Israeli citizen, Pester would have been required to serve in the Israeli army. But because he lives outside the country, he was able to defer the obligation by agreeing to limit the length of any stays in Israel. Pester says his Israeli ties have been significant to his parents because of their Jewish faith. \u201cIsrael is a very holy place for them, and they have a sense of pride knowing their son is Israeli,\u201d Pester says. Wildes suggests dual nationals tell the State Department if they plan to serve in another country\u2019s military. Unlike joining the Israeli army, joining the military of a country in conflict with the United States is grounds for automatic expatriation, Olivas says. But short of taking up arms against the United States or being convicted of treason, dual nationals may participate in a variety of activities abroad, including voting, without having their U.S. citizenship revoked, according to Wildes and Olivas. Other pitfalls dual nationals face include filing tax returns, Wildes says, especially when working with an accountant or tax preparer who is unfamiliar with the tax laws of both countries. In some cases, people can be taxed by both home nations by mistake. In other cases, they might be penalized if they mistakenly fail to pay taxes in one country. Additional challenges have come into play with increasing recognition of same-sex marriages. Although recognized in several states, when it comes to immigration law such marriages are not recognized by the U.S. government. As a result, there are occasions in which same-sex spouses are \u201cforced off U.S. soil,\u201d Wildes says. For example, a same-sex marriage involving only one U.S. citizen is not grounds alone to allow the non-U.S. spouse to live here legally, he says. Moving toward seamlessness Overall, ease of travel and living abroad has improved for dual citizens over time, Wildes says. Countries are moving toward \u201cseamlessness\u201d of travel to make entering and exiting their borders easier, he says, especially since a main reason many individuals have dual citizenships is for \u201cease of commerce.\u201d Though he was born in Chicago and now lives in New Hampshire, Jayme Sim\u00f5es, 44, is going through the process of obtaining Portuguese citizenship. Sim\u00f5es\u2019 father was Portuguese, making citizenship in that country possible. Sim\u00f5es speaks Portuguese fluently and frequently conducts business in Portugal, so getting a second passport makes sense, he says. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I love Portugal.\u201d Similarly, 35-year-old Andres Arango \u2013 a dual U.S.-Colombian national \u2013 enjoys the benefits of having two passports. \u201cHaving a passport from Colombia is a burden. You have to have a visa to go anywhere in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot have an impromptu trip to Europe because you need a visa. It takes time and it takes money. For that reason, the (U.S.) passport is amazing. The ability to travel freely around the world with a blue passport is great.\u201d In addition to easier travel, people might have other reasons for pursuing dual nationality, including potential tax benefits. Every four years, immigration policies get another look-over for one competitive reason: Olympic athletes sometimes pursue dual citizenship to put them in better standing to compete, Olivas says. Nationality and identity Many people pursue dual citizenship because it is important to their identities. Diane Saarinen, a 48-year-old living in Brooklyn, recently became a Finnish citizen in homage to her deceased parents. She was born in New York, and her parents were Finns who never became  U.S. citizens. Saarinen grew up speaking Finnish and spending childhood summers playing with lambs and cows in the Scandinavian countryside, and she began to miss that part of her identity without her parents to keep it alive. To stay connected, she became involved in the Finnish community in New York, which eventually led to her desire for Finnish citizenship. She has no set plans to return to Finland but says moving to Spain or Finland one day sounds like \u201can exotic retirement plan.\u201d Plus, her dual citizenship is meaningful for her 89-year-old aunt, who was 16 when she moved to the United States from Finland. Katarina Bridova, a 34-year-old native of Slovakia now living in Connecticut, became a U.S. citizen in February because of her desire to actively participate in this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cI chose to become a U.S. citizen because I want to vote,\u201d she says. \u201cI pay taxes and I\u2019ve been part of the discussion. \u2026 I don\u2019t really follow Slovak politics. I\u2019m present here, and I want to take advantage of it.\u201d Dual nationality has become an issue of self-reflection, says Villanova\u2019s Wilson, a question of \u201cwho are we as a country?\u201d Understanding the debate can be difficult because the rules can seem \u201cfuzzy and ambiguous,\u201d she says, and there is no \u201ccentral repository\u201d for information about dual citizenship. Boostani, the Russian who moved to Los Angeles, says she wishes the nuances of being a dual citizen were easier to understand. \u201cWhen it comes to people who are already here and are trying to establish themselves, whether immigration-wise or socially or economically, there is not enough information about that,\u201d Boostani says. \u201cOr if there is, it\u2019s very dispersed and you can\u2019t find all the information in one place.\u201d For now, Boostani says she is working to bring her family members to the United States from Russia, and has already been successful in helping her younger brother make the journey. \u201cI\u2019m building up my family here because this is where my base and home is,\u201d Boostani says. \u201cBeing able to travel freely \u2026 that\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s a privilege.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: This is part of a series exploring the concept of American exceptionalism. Earlier, we \n            \n                examined its effect on politics and areas in which other countries lead the way. By Moni Basu, CNN Atlanta (CNN) \u2013 When the moment finally arrived, 86 of us stood up to utter 31 sacred words. I raised my right hand. My heart was pounding. All those years spent in public schools in America, I\u2019d refrained from saying the Pledge of Allegiance. It was wrong to say it when my loyalties lay elsewhere. But that changed with a ceremony on a July day four years ago. And it changed me. I learned lessons about the meaning of country and more importantly, about myself. I\u2019d been in America almost three decades but happily retained an Indian passport. Over the years, each time it was renewed, my green card changed to pink and white but the status remained the same: permanent U.S. resident. I\u2019d lived here so long that I felt just as much American as I did Indian, but I had my reasons for not taking that last formal step that made my Americanness official. One was practical \u2013 there was a matter of inheriting my father\u2019s property in Kolkata, India, and for a long time, that process was excruciatingly painful without Indian citizenship. My father knew what a bureaucratic nightmare inheritance could be, and as long as he was alive, he encouraged me to stay an Indian. The other reason I held back was far more personal. India does not allow dual citizenship with the United States, and assuming U.S. citizenship would effectively mean renouncing India. That felt like betrayal, a severance with the land that gave me birth and shaped me. I spent a chunk of my childhood in India. When my family finally settled in the United States, I struggled to find myself. I learned to speak English well, even with a twinge of Southern drawl, some would say. I went to high school dances and loved my Levi\u2019s and even went out on dates, something I would never have done in India at that time. But I never felt fully accepted. I was always an \u201cother\u201d on forms that asked for race and ethnicity, before the days when Asian-American became a census category. In high school and college, I found myself fighting stereotypes and answering absurd questions about India, such as \u201cdo people live in grass huts?\u201d Sometimes, I felt Americans simply didn\u2019t understand me and that everything would be better if I could just go back to India. The yearning for home and family grew stronger with age, especially after my parents moved back to India in 1985. I felt a need to rediscover my roots, not uncommon, I suppose, among immigrant children. But every time I returned home to visit, I realized I could never feel fully at home in India anymore. I was too Americanized. A memsahib, the elders in my family joked, referring to the term for British women during colonial times. That, too, is not uncommon among immigrant children. Many of us feel neither here nor there, straddling two cultures as we navigate key years of our lives. In my case, I was happy to go on as a citizen of one country, a resident of another. I paid my taxes and enjoyed all the freedoms afforded Americans save two things. I never served on a jury and more importantly, I could not vote. I never had an electoral say in India either because it did not allow absentee voting. I hailed from the world\u2019s largest democracy and lived in the world\u2019s most powerful one, but was unable to take part in a free society\u2019s most essential expression. I always felt cheated, or worse, that I was falling short. In 2004, I covered the presidential elections for\u00a0an Atlanta newspaper, and after months of excitement and intrigue I was frustrated that I could not cast a ballot on Election Day. By then I had cleared the biggest legal hurdles in India in settling my father\u2019s property. And so it happened that I sat down to fill out the necessary forms declaring my intent to become American. I was fingerprinted, passed citizenship tests that challenged my knowledge of the Constitution and was finally called to take the oath in July 2008. At the suburban Atlanta offices of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, I scanned the room to see faces from Vietnam to Venezuela. There were people from 38 different countries there that day for the naturalization ceremony. I thought back to all the people I had met in my career as a reporter, of people who fought for freedom in lands that kept them caged, and others who clawed their way to these shores to break free. I remembered Cuban dissenters I had met on my trip to Havana, and Afghan women who risked their lives to make things better for their little girls. Today, all we have to do is look to the men and women of the Arab Spring, who took to the streets to oust governments that kept them down. Think of how much people risk to attain the kind of freedom we enjoy in America. And how much people in our own country have struggled to rid our society of prejudice and persecution. My naturalization ceremony was testament to the American spirit. I looked around me and realized that this wasn\u2019t just about the journeys people had made; it was about the potential of all they could achieve in their new nation. I thought about the Americans I\u2019d met who worked hard, determined to achieve the American dream; about how their expectations were greater than their fears. Such was the case with Fernando Andrade, who left behind Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military rule in Chile and arrived here without a college degree or English skills. He started in construction jobs and worked his way up to become a successful businessman. Or Darly Pierre, who fled the brutal dictatorship of Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier. She came to America ready to fulfill her dreams. In Haiti, she said, she never had that chance. I thought, too, about all the Americans I met who inspired me to carry on in the face of adversity. They, too, championed the American spirit. Dylynn Waters lost her New Orleans home to Hurricane Katrina, resettled in Atlanta only to lose her home again in a fire. Waters persevered with a smile on her face. She said she had learned that it was not possessions that made a home. Richard Ingram was a young cavalry scout whose arm was blown off in a roadside bombing in Iraq. He returned home determined to make the best of life. He is the first severely wounded soldier in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to become an officer. America is filled with such stories. It is a nation that gives people hope. On that July day, I felt proud, and extremely lucky, to be a part of this land. I glanced at Francisco Montiel of Venezuela, standing to my right, dressed for the occasion in a khaki suit and blue tie. And on my left stood my friend Vino Wong, a photographer for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper and a native of Malaysia. I wondered what they were thinking as they, too, became U.S. citizens. Did they have the same emotions I did? Was their joy tinged with the melancholy of giving up a homeland? My eyes welled as I began the oath. \u201cI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. \u2026\u201d Two worlds collided in my head as I drove to the Fulton County Courthouse with my new certificate of citizenship so that I could register to vote in time for the 2008 presidential elections. That November, America made history with the election of Barack Obama as its first black president. The election became an important part of my own history as I stepped up to a voting booth and cast a ballot for the very first time. Since then, I\u2019ve come to think differently of my new citizenship. I know now that swearing allegiance to the red, white and blue gave me new nationality. But nothing can ever take away my identity or that of the 40 million other people living in America who were born in other countries. My Indian roots run deep, and I strive to carry with me every day the very best of two lands. That is, after all, what makes America great.",

            "article_content": "Tucson chief worries about $10 million cost and 50,000 immigration checks Phoenix police begin enforcing law but have no immediate feedback from officers Two sheriffs report business as usual Experts raise questions about racial profiling under the immigration check law The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding a piece of Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration law portends such a \u201chuge\u201d increase in policing for one department that the chief wondered Tuesday if his agency will be able to handle the workload. At a time when the Tucson Police Department is down 160 officers because of a weakened economy, the agency now must make up to 50,000 additional phone calls a year to federal officials to verify the immigration status of persons whom officers have stopped and have reason to believe are in the country illegally, Police Chief Roberto Villase\u00f1or said Tuesday. Other law agencies in Arizona, however, reported \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d a day after the Supreme Court ruling. Just 70 miles from the Mexican border, the Tucson department may have to spend more than $10 million a year to book and jail up to 36,000 arrestees also suspected of being illegal immigrants \u2013 a more than 7% increase to the agency\u2019s $130 million budget, Villase\u00f1or said. Toobin: I have sympathy for AZ officers Immigration ruling leaves questions Ariz. Gov. Brewer: This is not the end The police chief said he wonders if his 950-officer agency has been dealt an \u201cimpossible mandate.\u201d The state law, SB 1070, allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws, the chief said. Romney, GOP struggle with immigration issue \u201cJust for my agency, it will be a huge workload, just making the calls and waiting for a response on what to do,\u201d the police chief of Arizona\u2019s second-largest city said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the federal government is capable of handling all the requests that they will be receiving,\u201d Villase\u00f1or added. \u201cI don\u2019t know what effect it will have on my agency.\u201d Tuesday marked the first 24 hours that state and local law agencies began enforcing the state immigration law since Monday\u2019s court ruling, and law agencies were either engaged in training or rolling out the mandatory immigration checks, said Amy Rezzonico, a spokeswoman for Arizona attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it will be business as usual to some degree,\u201d Rezzonico said. Analysis: Five things learned from high court ruling That was the case for the more than 3,100 police officers in Phoenix, the state\u2019s largest city, located 180 miles from the border. A police department spokesman said Tuesday he had no immediate feedback from officers or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the progress or results of the day\u2019s immigration checks. \u201cWe\u2019re really not attempting a big shift from what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d said spokesman Sgt. Tommy Thompson. \u201cI think there\u2019s a misconception that police officers in Arizona are going to go out and hunt down people who are illegally in the United States. \u201cI am mandated to make a reasonable attempt to contact ICE,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s 107 in Phoenix today. How long am I going to stand on the side of the road with someone (awaiting an ICE response)? It\u2019s a matter of minutes \u2013 20 minutes maybe, 30 minutes maybe.\u201d Groups say immigration fight is changing Arizona Concerns by lawmen such as Villase\u00f1or unfolded as President Barack Obama and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer squared off about the impact of Monday\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the \u201cshow-me-your-papers\u201d provision \u2013 but struck down other portions of the state law intended to deter illegal immigration. Already, the Obama administration has indicated it won\u2019t allow Arizona\u2019s immigration priorities to become federal priorities. The administration has ended the so-called 287(g) agreements with Arizona, under which state and local law agencies entered into a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and were delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions. Also, the administration recently halted deportations of DREAM Act-eligible immigrants \u2013 young adult undocumented immigrants \u2013 as it will redirect resources to deporting those who are deemed a greater threat, such as criminals. The White House highlighted its tougher approach on criminals in announcing a record number of deportations last year. In denouncing some of those Obama measures, Arizona\u2019s Brewer said further lawsuits lay ahead on the immigration status checks, and pledged, \u201cThis certainly is not the end of our journey.\u201d The portion of the state law validated by the high court is potent, one expert said. \u201cIf you read the statute carefully, it literally creates an obligation for all law enforcement agencies to determine status of individuals,\u201d said Marc Miller, a vice dean and law professor at the University of Arizona. \u201cBy making it a mandate and lining it up against the warnings of the Supreme Court, it\u2019s created an impossibly difficult question for police and sheriffs. Are we concerned about racial profiling? Absolutely.\u201d But how police will apply the law \u2013 requiring immigration checks while enforcing other laws if \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of illegal immigration exists \u2013 is \u201cconfusing,\u201d CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. \u201cWhat does it look like in the real world to have reasonable suspicion that someone is here illegally? What is a police officer supposed to do?\u201d Toobin asked. \u201cHow to apply that in the real world is kind of mysterious to me.\u201d At least two sheriffs in Arizona said that the law won\u2019t result in great change for their departments. A changing national mood on immigration? Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said his deputies will continue to call the Border Patrol to determine a person\u2019s immigration status if a deputy suspects that person is in the country illegally. That will result in about 100 referrals a month to the Border Patrol, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to do business as usual,\u201d said Dupnik, who\u2019s been sheriff for 32 years. Dupnik said he opposed SB 1070 because if the entire law had been upheld by the federal courts, it would have resulted in overcrowded jails and overburdened state courts. \u201cThe more important thing is how the chief of a law enforcement agency chooses to enforce the law,\u201d Dupnik said. For example, other counties do immigration sweeps, but not his, he said. \u201cLaw enforcement did not ask for this law,\u201d Dupnik said. \u201cLaw enforcement did not need this law.\u201d Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada said the validated portion of the law marked \u201cvery little change\u201d for his department. His county shares a 50-mile border with Mexico and is a major corridor for smuggling of drugs and illegal migrants. His 39 officers will continue to call any of the 1,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents in his county to conduct immigration checks, he said. \u201cOur concern is the public perception of what we are doing,\u201d he said. He fears Latinos won\u2019t ask for help and witnesses won\u2019t come forward, he said. \u201cThe Hispanics will look at us a little differently, and that concerns me,\u201d Estrada said. Merchants and residents of the Latino community reported anxiety and fear among clientele and neighbors. Phoenix taqueria owner Hector Manrique said Tuesday that business has been dropping since the law was proposed in 2010; he predicted it will get worse now that the Supreme Court has ruled. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the Hispanic community,\u201d said Manrique, a native of Mexico who has been in Phoenix since 1990 and has run the Taqueria Guadalajara since 2003. \u201cIt seemed like everybody kind of forgot about it for a little bit and now, all of a sudden, I\u2019ve got friends who were talking to me yesterday, and they\u2019re pretty scared because they\u2019ve got kids, they\u2019ve got family to support.\u201d Kelly Ramirez, 31, of Tucson, a real estate broker and business owner, said many Latino immigrants don\u2019t know the details of the law, but they do know something has changed. \u201cThey can\u2019t really look into it, so what they\u2019ll do is they\u2019ll hide,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be less conversation, less help from individuals that maybe aren\u2019t doing anything wrong but know of somebody that is.\u201d Russell Pearce, the former Republican state senator who authored SB 1070 and then was ousted from office in a recall election in his suburban Phoenix district last year, told CNN Tuesday that accusations of possible racial profiling were \u201cdemeaning to law enforcement.\u201d \u201cAn officer is trained to pay attention to things that don\u2019t fit. All this bill does is allow them to ask the questions they need to ask,\u201d Pearce said.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: \n            \n                Matt A. Barreto is an associate professor of political science and an adjunct professor of law at the University of Washington. He is co-founder of the polling and research firm Latino Decisions and author of the book \u201cEthnic Cues: The Role of Shared Ethnicity in Latino Political Participation.\u201d Today, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on Arizona\u2019s controversial SB 1070 anti-immigration law that some observers are calling a \u201csplit decision\u201d or even a victory for the federal government over Arizona. Supreme Court mostly rejects Arizona immigration law; gov says \u2018heart\u2019 remains Though the decision did leave open the possibility of someone challenging how law enforcement officers implement the provision that the court upheld, for the Latino community, today is not \u201csplit\u201d or a \u201cvictory\u201d but rather a very serious blow to civil and human rights. For immigrants and opponents, court\u2019s ruling hits their real lives In May 2010, after the Arizona law was signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, a Latino Decisions poll found that 85% of Latino registered voters in Arizona believed that it would result in U.S. citizen Latinos being racially profiled and stopped by the police. Today, the court has created an opening that could allow those fears to come true. This is all happening in an election year, in which many pundits have called Latino voters a crucial bloc that could influence who wins the presidential election. So, what are the political implications of the court\u2019s ruling? In a poll of Latino voters in crucial battleground states, Latino Decisions and America\u2019s Voice found that\u00a0 a majority of Latinos are concerned about a growing anti-Latino environment, which was strongest in Arizona and Nevada, two states marked by anti-immigrant politics during the 2010 election. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 2.1% points in the overall sample, and +/- 4.9% points for each individual state. The Latino vote beyond Texas Even though the Arizona law claims to target only undocumented immigrants, survey results show that a clear majority of U.S. citizen Latinos, who are registered to vote, are also concerned about the implications of the law. Polling data consistently find that a large majority of Latinos strongly oppose giving state and local police the authority to check immigration status. This month, a Latino Decisions survey with Texas A&M political science professors Joseph Ura and Francisco Pedraza found that 71% of Latinos would be opposed to the court upholding police intervention in immigration checks. A clear majority of Latino voters across the U.S. stand opposed to SB 1070. The margin of error was +/-4.4% points. While some politicians have attempted to segregate \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants in directing their hostilities towards illegal immigrants, the newest data from the Latino Decisions/America\u2019s Voice poll suggest that no such dichotomy exists in how those distinctions are heard. When asked whether respondents personally know someone who is undocumented, 55% of Latino registered voters said yes \u2013 including 11% who said someone in their family is undocumented. Looking to the individual battleground states, we find very large percentages of Latino voters who are closely acquainted with undocumented immigrants. In Nevada, 74% say they know an undocumented immigrant, and in Arizona, it\u2019s 68%. Beyond merely being acquainted with undocumented immigrants, 30% of Latino registered voters say they know of a person or family who has faced detention or deportation for immigration reasons. In Nevada, 41% know someone who has faced immigration proceedings. Beyond concerns over racial profiling or creating an unfriendly atmosphere for Latinos, a very large number of Latino voters have a direct connection to people affected by Arizona\u2019s law. Given concerns over the court decision on SB 1070 and efforts by Democrats and Republicans to walk a tightrope on state immigration laws in places like Arizona and Alabama, a looming question is how Latinos view the two political parties in terms of reaching out or advocating on behalf of Latino issues. Overall, we found that 50% said the Democratic Party is currently doing a good job of reaching out to Latinos, while 30% said the Democrats are generally ignoring Latinos, and 6% said they were being hostile toward Latino issues. When evaluating the Republican Party, 15% said the GOP is doing a good job of Hispanic outreach, compared with 42% who said Republicans mostly ignore Latinos and 31% who think Republicans are hostile towards Latinos. While the Democrats perform better than Republicans in perceptions of outreach to Hispanics, Democrats are performing well in the minds of only half of all Latino registered voters. For Republicans, the outlook is more worrisome, with 73% of Latino voters saying the Republicans are either ignoring or being hostile towards Latinos. Given this current rating and prior Republican statements in favor of SB 1070, it will be difficult to change this perception in the short term. Already, Republican candidate Mitt Romney has said that immigration laws in Arizona are a model for the nation and that as president, he would drop the lawsuit against Arizona. Today, he went further, saying that each state has a right and duty to secure our borders, once again tying xenophobic rhetoric of \u201csecurity\u201d to a law that allows state police to detain and question anyone in their custody they suspect is undocumented. Polling by Latino Decisions and America\u2019s Voice shows Romney with a serious deficit among Latinos, especially in battleground states like Arizona, where he attracts just 18% of the Latino vote, compared with 74% for President Obama. The Supreme Court decision on SB 1070 and the continued discussion about the role that states should play in immigration enforcement are going to be part of the campaign messaging to Latino voters. Latinos will be paying close attention to what candidates say and what their records indicate. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Matt A. Barreto.",

            "article_content": "By Moni Basu, CNN (CNN) \u2013The immigration debate often centers on stemming the flow of people entering the United States illegally and what to do about securing borders to the south. But here\u2019s a fact that goes without much attention: Asians have now taken over Latinos as the largest group of new arrivals every year. In 2010, 36% of new immigrants were Asians compared to 31% for Hispanics, according to a report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s a significant change from a decade ago, when 19% of immigrants were Asians and 59% were Hispanics. \u201cThey were already a significant part of the immigration story. It seems like in the last few years they are the most important part of the immigration story,\u201d said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside, and expert on Asian-American immigration and civic participation. He said that if the trends continue, Asian-Americans will play greater roles in shaping American society and perhaps, more significantly in an election year, they will have an impact at the polls. \u201cThis is an important moment to see immigration for what it is \u2013 that it is far more complicated and diverse than deporting illegal immigrants,\u201d Ramakrishnan said, referring to discussion sparked by President Barack Obama\u2019s policy shift last week to spare some children of illegal immigrants from deportation. Far fewer Asian Americans enter the United States illegally than do Hispanics. The Pew survey looked at recent arrivals of people with both legal and unauthorized status, as well as those arriving with work, student or other temporary visas. Pew\u2019s exhaustive new report on Asian-Americans found important differences between Asian-Americans and other population groups in America.\u00a0It also shed light on the diversity among Asian-Americans, who sometimes cringe at the broadness of the category that covers every country of origin from Afghanistan to South Korea. The Pew survey showed that across the board, Asian-Americans are more satisfied than any other Americans with their lives, finances and direction of the country. They also place more value on traditional marriage, family and parenthood and usually possess a strong work ethic. Nearly seven in 10 respondents said people could get ahead if they are willing to work hard. And 93% of Asian-Americans describe people of their origin as \u201cvery hard-working,\u201d whereas only 57% said the same about Americans as a whole. Asian-Americans also attain college degrees (61%) at about double the rate of recent non-Asian immigrants (30%), Pew found. \u201cThe overall picture that you get from this survey is that like immigrants throughout American history, Asian-Americans are strivers,\u201d said Pew\u2019s Paul Taylor, who edited the study. \u201cBut what\u2019s interesting about them are the educational credentials.\u201d He said. \u201cBy far they are the best educated in American history.\u201d It\u2019s not that Asian-Americans value education more. \u201cEveryone values education,\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \u201cBut the difference is in the sacrifices Asian-Americans are willing to make.\u201d He said his department\u2019s research has found instances where Asian families in Southern California will move into a much smaller house in order to move to the best school districts. However, some Asian-Americans recognize that they may go overboard in stressing hard work. Nearly 39% in the Pew survey said Asian-American parents put too much pressure on their children to do well in school. Think \u201cBattle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,\u201d the provocative memoir by Yale Law Professor Amy Chua that sparked conversation about strict parenting. Pew recognized the vast differences between the nationalities lumped under the U.S. Census Bureau category of Asian-American \u2013 the six major countries are China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam and India. New citizens: Why did you become an American? Indian-Americans lead other groups in terms of income and education. Seven in 10 Indian-American adults ages 25 and older have a college degree, compared with about half of Americans of Korean, Chinese, Filipino and Japanese ancestry, and about a quarter of Vietnamese-Americans. Ramakrishnan attributed that largely to the fact that the Indians coming to America are the cream of the crop. They also have very high proficiency levels in English because of a history of British colonialism. As a whole, Pew found Asian median income and household wealth exceeded average Americans. Asian median annual household income is $66,000 versus $49,800 for all Americans. Asians who came to this country are more likely than their compatriots back home to say their standard of living is better than that of their parents at the same stage of life. But there are differences on the socioeconomic ladder. Americans with Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese and \u201cother U.S. Asian\u201d origins have a higher poverty rate than does the general public, while Pew found that those with Indian, Japanese and Filipino origins have lower rates. There were other factors that made the groups distinct. The survey noted that Indian-Americans stand out in the personal importance they place on parenting \u2013 78% of them said being a good parent is one of the most important things to them personally. Korean-Americans are the most likely to say discrimination against their group is a major problem, and they are the least likely to say that their group gets along very well with other racial and ethnic groups. In contrast, Filipinos are the most positive on interethnic and interracial relations in America. The Vietnamese are the only major subgroup who arrived on American shores as political refugees; the others say they have come mostly for economic, educational and family reasons. Ramakrishnan said the Vietnamese were also the only subgroup that tended to vote Republican but that is changing given anti-immigration positions and other exclusionary measures supported by some GOP lawmakers. The American dream began later for Asian-Americans than other immigrant groups because of racial discrimination. It was not until 1965, during the height of the civil rights movement and robust economic growth, that the United States opened its doors to immigration from all parts of the world. The decision paved the way for Asian-Americans to grow from less than 1% of the population more than 40 years ago to nearly 6% now. Persisting prejudice against Asians led to many communities developing in their own enclaves, Taylor said. Hence the blossoming of Chinatowns, Japantowns and Koreatowns. But now Asian-Americans are more likely to live in mixed neighborhoods and marry out of their race. \u201cWhen newly minted medical school graduate Priscilla Chan married Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg last month, she joined the 37% of all recent Asian-American brides who wed a non-Asian groom,\u201d the Pew report said. Between 2008 and 2010, 29% of all Asian newlyweds married someone of a different race, compared with 26% of Hispanics, 17% of blacks and 9% of whites. Among them, Japanese had the highest rate of intermarriage and Indians had the lowest, Pew said. More than half of recent Japanese newlyweds married a non-Asian; among recent Indian newlyweds, one in eight did. Another big distinction was with single parenthood. Forty-one percent of all American parents are single parents. Among Asians, that number plummets to 16 % and among Indians, it\u2019s 2% to 3%. Pew spoke with 3,511 Asian-Americans between January 3 and March 27. The telephone interviews were conducted in English and seven Asian languages. Ramakrishnan said the Asian-American population, unnoticed before in many spheres of American life, would only continue to increase its share of the spotlight. In swing states like Virginia and Nevada, where census data now shows Asians make up 9% of the population, Asian-Americans will make a mark at the ballot box in November, Ramakrishnan predicted. Most tend to vote Democratic. \u201cRepublicans should be wary,\u201d he said. At the very least, Taylor said the robust Asian-American immigration is sure to redefine the debate over people coming to these shores. \u201cIllegal immigration has been a driver of the immigration policy debate and illegal immigration has been primarily associated with Hispanics,\u201d he said. But now, he said, the discussion may be forced to keep up with immigration realities.",

Immigration is always a hot-button issue, and can even be a vote-changing one, because it gets to the heart of who we believe we are as Americans and as people. For many readers at CNN.com, the Obama administration\u2019s announcement that it will give a two-year deferral from deportation to some young immigrants who came to the United States as children \u2013 if they meet certain requirements \u2013 is symbolic of society\u2019s attitude toward immigration in general. Obama administration to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants Quite a few commenters were dismayed, because they have been hoping for politicians to take a hard stance against illegal immigration. dfr333: \u201cCongratulations Romney, you just got my vote, and I did not even want to vote for you \u2026\u201d Rachel1989: \u201cAgain, this just riled up the Republican base even more and made Romney look good. This just cost Obama the election.\u201d Some readers were happy because they were afraid someone they knew would be deported. jboo10141: \u201cI knew a girl in college who was a third year medical student and was fighting against getting deported because her family came here when she was 6. This is a great move. I applaud Obama for standing and doing what he thinks is right. So many young children who came here went to college or went to war and have been doing everything they can to live a fulfilling life now have the chance to do so. Keep up the good work.\u201d Does illegal immigration hurt the United States, and how? Readers don\u2019t agree. starspangled:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re struggling economically as it is, and now Obama will add more pressure on the poor and middle-class citizen. We cannot continue taking in Latin America into this nation.\u201d PoppyLee: \u201cThey\u2019re already here. We\u2019re just letting them join legally, pay taxes and all that.\u201d Was the decision about political posturing to win over certain groups? USExpatInCan: \u201cNothing but a cheap tactic to get re-elected.\u00a0Obama will sell his soul to the devil if he could to get re-elected. Man, he is desperate.\u201d Max: \u201cThese people can\u2019t vote. How will they help him get re-elected. Do you think before you type?\u201d Some readers talked about their family\u2019s own history of immigration. jwm57:\u00a0\u201cI am a \u2018real American.\u2019 Some of my ancestors were here before 1650, and all immigrated before 1820. Several served in the Revolutionary War, and more recently in the two World Wars. I vote. I pay taxes. I have never been arrested - never even got detention in school. I support the president on this. My ancestors were able to come here legally because there were no restrictions on immigration when they came; I don\u2019t know how my family history would have been different if it were as difficult to immigrate from Europe in the 1700s as it is to immigrate from Mexico today. These young adults did not choose to come here, but those targeted by this change have acculturated and proven themselves as responsible members of our society. We should make at least a partial return to our roots and show some fairness here.\u201d Some people reacting to the decision were legal immigrants or those seeking permanent status. Many of them expressed frustration that greater attention isn\u2019t being paid to their issues. Commenter houstoniano, whose real name is Aldrin Nunes of Houston, said greater attention needs to be paid to legal immigration. \u201cI cannot believe it; I\u2019ve been in this country for 12 years with my family studying, working, paying my taxes and bills and etc. \u2026, never had a problem with justice; I had two little American girls, and I am still waiting in the line to get my green card that I will probably have in 2014. That\u2019s seven years waiting for a document, and people who\u00a0get in this country illegally will have much more privilege than I have and never paid a dime to the government. I am talking about H1B\u00a0work visa, H4 dependent visa and F1 visa.\u201d We followed up with him, and he responded to explain that while Obama\u2019s announcement is a two-year deferral rather than citizenship or amnesty, he believes that the affected people will eventually have a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d that affords them studying, a job and the ability to look forward to getting a green card. Nunes said he wishes he could travel to see his family and his elderly grandmother, but the green card application process makes it difficult. \u201cThis law doesn\u2019t affect me, but it\u00a0is outrageous that the government does not care about the legal immigrants who are making extra efforts to be here legally,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cI want to clarify that I am not against those people receiving this benefit. What I am saying is that people like me should have some kind of consideration at this point.\u201d Another reader, also claiming to be a legal immigrant, expressed stronger emotions in their comment. godcloud: \u201cAs a LEGAL immigrant who got to this country the RIGHT way. Paid my dues and worked really hard to get my citizenship. This really pisses me off! Guess what Obama, here is a voter who can legally vote who is not going to vote for you! By doing this you are making the hard work it takes for a true LEGAL immigrant mean nothing. Stop calling these people immigrants. They are criminals. There is a reason why we call them ILLEGALS. God I hope this guy does not get re-elected.\u201d Lolaz007:\u00a0\u201cObama is MIA on immigration reform that would create a win-win for legal, skilled immigrants and the U.S. While he\u2019s busy pandering to a particular group, he could have taken a stand and been proactive in doing something about improving the process and quotas for legal, skilled immigrants (H1B visa program). And I have to wonder: How do legal immigrants and those who are paying thousands of dollars (I\u2019ve heard that it can cost anywhere from $10-20K) for their work visas feel about Obama\u2019s latest action?\u201d There was some discussion about the political process by which this decision arose. Susan Reaney: \u201cDon\u2019t you just love those executive orders where the president BYPASSES CONGRESS\u2026.NOT!\u201d DelishusCake: \u201cDid I miss the part where they changed our immigration laws, or is he publicly stating that he wants to ignore our laws and just do whatever he feels is best?\u00a0This is really unfair, what a shame. \u2026\u201d Many readers supporting the decision noted that the people in question came over as children. Jayk Wiggins:\u00a0\u201cI am a staunch Republican who 100% agrees with\u00a0this act. If people want to work then let them. These kids deserve just as much of a chance as any spoiled entitled American. If they took your job, then it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019ve got a great friend who went to school for engineering with\u00a0me, also placed at the top of our class, and now has to find work as a car mechanic just to pay his bills. He was brought over when he was 12, has not received any benefits from the government, and has paid far more of his fair share. Far more than most of the whinny racists in this country. Excluding him and others like him from the workforce is only hurting this country.\u00a0I really wish my fellow Republicans were a little more respectful of liberty and a little less ignorant xenophobes.\u201d Some readers explained that their opposition to the decision stems from wanting to prevent illegal immigration. PoppyLee: \u201cGreat. No reason to punish the kids.\u201d groled: \u201cIt\u2019s not about punishing them. This encourages illegals to bring children here and bring themselves. It\u2019s basically bait. I don\u2019t blame the kids. Heck, I don\u2019t blame the parents. Their country sucks and won\u2019t fix itself. But we have laws in place for a reason.\u201d Should people be accountable for their parents\u2019 actions? Guest: \u201cI am shocked at the level of hatred on this blog. These kids are here through no fault of their own; perhaps all of you should be held accountable for what your parents did; so if your father, mother or siblings committed any crime, by your reasoning, you should be held accountable, too \u2026 think about it.\u201d theTH1NKER: \u201cI am being held accountable for my parents\u2019 doings. Despite being valedictorian of my high school, I had to amass huge school loan debt because my dad\u2019s business went into bankruptcy and he couldn\u2019t even buy groceries.\u00a0Twenty years later, I\u2019m still digging out of that hole. If only I was eligible for minority scholarships back then. Hatred isn\u2019t an inherent trait. It\u2019s developed through experiences \u2026 think about it.\u201d And then there was this reader, who says they believe that this decision is an attempt to please various sides. Bob Bichen:\u00a0\u201cA very reasonable compromise. It is time that we come to terms with our love/hate relationship with illegal immigration. We are happy to look the other way when our fruit and vegetables are picked, laundry\u00a0washed and lawns mowed. For those who have worked and/or studied hard in school, and who have no criminal history, there is no justification for deportation, whether they are illegals or their children. The real problem is the broken and overtaxed bureaucracy related to immigration, citizenship applications and work permits. I have no problem deporting criminals, and there are at least some in the illegal category. But for the others, who just want a better life, they are actually a potential asset to this nation, just as our ancestors were who immigrated to this great country in years or centuries past.\u201d Are we taking jobs away from teens, or are teens taking jobs away from themselves? Steve1000:\u00a0\u201cWonderful, American teens have among the highest unemployment rate. Obama has with this act made it even more difficult for them to find work. This pool of illegals will now legally be hired by companies that could not before due to I9 form requirements.\u201d pithed: \u201cIf they are anything like my grandkids, they are too busy texting to even look for a job. Another issue, but I don\u2019t see anyone suffering that much around here. A lot of that \u2018economy is so bad\u2019 is garbage.\u201d Some said the policy could be extended a bit. icetemp: \u201cI think this should go one step further.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0 Alberto R. Gonzales is the former U.S. attorney general and counsel to President George W. Bush. He is currently the Doyle Rogers Distinguished Chair of Law at Belmont University, and counsel at the Nashville law firm of Waller Lansden. By  Alberto R. Gonzales, Special to CNN The right to vote is a precious privilege. It provides the opportunity for every citizen to equally affect the future of our government no matter their last name, ZIP code or skin color. It was my job as attorney general to protect the sanctity of every vote. Based on my experience, voter identification laws serve as an effective deterrent to fraudulent voting. I know there are concerns that such laws discourage voting and hurt minorities. NAACP president: Voter ID requirements are like Jim Crow voter oppression laws However, we should not abandon our efforts against voter fraud. Instead, those concerns are best addressed by vigorous enforcement of existing federal regulations and laws, such as the Voting Rights Act, which provide protections against government actions that adversely affect the voting rights of minorities. I condemn laws that discriminate based on race, and I support reasonable voter identification laws. At the end of the day, I want to see more Americans voting, and states able to easily facilitate the right to vote. The Hispanic vote is important in this election and future elections, and from my view, it is not voter ID laws that will prevent them from voting for President Barack Obama but his economic policies. I grew up in an impoverished neighborhood where families took care of their own and believed government assistance was only for the most needy \u2013 those who could not help themselves. We were poor but not helpless, We viewed ourselves as proud, self-reliant Americans. Just like my parents, many Hispanic families today are struggling just to buy food and gas and pay the rent. Their focus is not yet on the presidential race because they have real concerns that are more pressing. For this reason, I do not think the polls accurately reflect Hispanic support for Obama and believe that support will drop as we approach the election. Despite what the polls may say, many of my Hispanic friends \u2013who are not politically active but identify as Republican or Democrat \u2013 privately confess their concerns about both men. In Obama, they see a gifted president who is able to identify with their struggles and give voice to the powerless, someone who has lived the American dream they wish for themselves and their children. They also see a man who broke his promise to them about immigration reform and someone who champions social policies at odds with religious teaching, such as his recent support for same-sex marriage. As the election season approaches, more Hispanics will evaluate their economic situation and ask themselves whether they are better off than they were four years ago, and whether the president is capable of delivering on his promises and can be trusted to help them achieve their dreams. This is potentially good news for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney because it means he still has time. In Romney, Hispanics tell me they see a successful businessman and experienced chief executive who inspires hope with a positive message, someone who has created jobs and understands the details of economic policy. They see the kind of leader America needs in our current economic plight. They also see a man who is rich and white, someone incapable of understanding what it is to struggle or to want, and unfamiliar with the pain of racial discrimination. But it remains to be seen whether Romney can make a personal connection and convince Hispanic voters that he relates to their problems, cares about their future and can create an environment of opportunity for all Americans. Gonzales says Romney must make personal connection to Hispanics College students tell me they intend to support\u00a0 Obama because they view him as a contemporary, someone who is cool and at ease with technology and late-night talk show hosts. He is a role model and source of excitement. Other students approaching graduation are not as supportive. They will soon enter the job market with few, if any, job prospects and staggering student debt. For them, a successful businessman like Romney might succeed in creating jobs where the president has failed. Hispanics are extraordinarily diverse, and the choice we make on Election Day will be a very personal one. Like all voters, Hispanics will vote their self-interests and vote for their future. That choice has the power to elect the next president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alberto R. Gonzales.",

Stewart, CNN (CNN) \u2013 By now, it has been established that Latino voters are a diverse group and a crucial electorate that will help determine the next president of the United States. But here is what\u2019s new to know about the impact of Latino voters: It will be felt in places one might not expect. \u201cMoving beyond the Southwest and Florida, Latino voters can also influence the election results in \u2018nontraditional\u2019 states like North Carolina, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, \u201d said Matt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions, a polling firm. \u201cThose states have had substantial growth in the Latino population and among voters, based on our analysis of census data and statewide voter rolls.\u201d Florida-based political analyst Charles Garcia noted earlier this year that in North Carolina, the number of registered Hispanic voters has almost doubled to more than 130,000 since the last presidential election. \u201cPresident Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by 14,000 votes,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cIn 2008 there were 68,000 registered Latino voters, and a whopping 84% of them participated in the election.\u201d Polling experts say this shift will affect the 2012 election. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll found 61% of Latino registered voters\u2019 choice for president was Barack Obama, and 27% choose former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Latino voters played a key role in Obama\u2019s 2008 win over Republican John McCain. Nationally, Obama won 67% of Hispanic voters, including the battleground state of Florida, with 57% of the Latino vote. It was only four years earlier that Latino voters in Florida supported President George W. Bush with 56% of the vote in his re-election bid. Nationally, Bush was re-elected with 40% of the\u00a0 Latino vote. Republican strategist Ana Navarro suggests that Romney\u2019s \u201ccampaign needs to wake up and go to sleep every night thinking of the Latino vote\u201d\u00a0 to win the election. And as the American demographic changes, David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, comments that the GOP\u2019s traditional voters are \u201cdying off\u201d. The Republican Party understands the need to court Latino voters to win the White House and continues to make outreach efforts. Demographic changes may be shining a spotlight on the candidates\u2019 efforts, but it is the issues that matter. It comes as no surprise that for Latinos, just as for all Americans, improving the economy is a top concern. But how candidates speak about immigration, even as most Latinos are American citizens,\u00a0 have shaped conversation and discussion that are informing how Latinos vote. Of particular interest has been support of the DREAM Act, a bill that offers a path to citizenship for some minors who entered the country illegally. Additionally, as immigration from Mexico has come to a virtual halt, the future of how the Latino vote is discussed will affect how this electorate is viewed. \u201cThe Latino vote has gone from being an ethnic vote, to an immigrant vote and now back to an ethnic vote, \u201d said Gregory Rodriguez, founder of Center for Social Cohesion at Arizona State University. \u201cThe end of immigration as we know it is redefining Latinos and redefining the so called Latino vote.\u201d Read more about the Latino vote: Would a Latino running mate help Romney, Republicans?

He still has tremendous support.\u201d But Latinos in Arizona are a growing political force and demonstrated their clout last year when they led a successful campaign in recalling former state Sen. Russell Pearce, the Republican who authored Arizona\u2019s controversial law against illegal immigrants that\u2019s now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pearce lost the recall election. \u201cThere\u2019s a very vocal Latino faction in the state of Arizona that felt when they were successful with recalling Russell Pearce \u2026 it was enough to put blood in the water to think that, \u2018Let\u2019s go after Sheriff Joe now,\u2019\u201d Wikfors told CNN. Heightening the political stakes is the fact that Thursday\u2019s legal action against Maricopa County and its sheriff is the Justice Department\u2019s first lawsuit, in the federal agency\u2019s 18-year history in civil police reform work, to stop what it sees as discriminatory and unconstitutional policing. Said Wikfors, \u201cI will tell you that it\u2019s not new for the sheriff to be in a position where you\u2019ve got the federal government in conflict with him on an issue. He\u2019s not a stranger to these types of battles.\u201d Some analysts consider the lawsuit a political maneuver by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cObviously, if this is something unconstitutional, it would have to come to an end, but my fear is that this is political more than anything else,\u201d said Jon Feere, legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, a self-described \u201clow-immigration, pro-immigrant\u201d think tank. \u201cClearly the Department of Justice has limited resources when it files lawsuits, but it\u2019s going against states that are attempting to uphold immigration law and not filing lawsuits against states and communities with sanctuary policies, which clearly undermine federal law.\u201d Critics say the so-called sanctuary policies protect illegal immigrants. In his 18 years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents. Rather than shy away from controversy, he has embraced it, touting his nickname of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Toughest Sheriff\u201d on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation, costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece. His cutting out salt and pepper saved taxpayers $20,000 a year, according to his biography on the sheriff\u2019s website. Another program Arpaio began posts mugshots of all those arrested \u2013 about 300 daily \u2013 on the sheriff\u2019s website as they are booked and processed into jail, according to the biography. The site gets \u201cjust under a million hits daily,\u201d it said. He has been re-elected to five four-year terms as sheriff since taking office in 1993. But last December, the Justice Department said it had found cause to believe the sheriff\u2019s office \u201chas engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the Constitution and federal law\u201d and, under the leadership of Arpaio, discriminated against Latinos through traffic stops, detentions and arrests and against Latino inmates with limited English proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services. The Justice Department also found that Arpaio and the sheriff\u2019s office engaged in \u201ca pattern or practice of unlawful retaliatory behavior against perceived critics of (the office) through baseless criminal charges, unfounded civil lawsuits and meritless administrative actions,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said Thursday. U.S. sues controversial Arizona sheriff Attempts by the Justice Department to negotiate a settlement with the sheriff\u2019s office broke down in February because Arpaio and his department \u201cwould not agree to any settlement that included an independent monitor\u201d to ensure reforms are carried out, said Perez. The Justice Department was \u201cleft with no choice\u201d and filed a civil complaint in U.S. District Court against the sheriff, his department and the county. According to Arpaio\u2019s website, Maricopa has the nation\u2019s third largest sheriff\u2019s department, employing more than 3,400 people. During his tenure, the sheriff banned smoking, coffee, movies, pornographic magazines and unrestricted televisions viewing in jails, according to his biography. The jail system\u2019s inmates \u2013 between 7,500 and 10,000 \u2013 are fed twice daily to cut down on meal costs. The infamous pink underwear came about when Arpaio had all inmate underwear dyed pink after learning inmates were stealing white boxer shorts, the sheriff\u2019s site said. He also ordered pink handcuffs when those began disappearing. Another controversial program: Arpaio\u2019s \u201cchain gangs,\u201d including the world\u2019s first-ever female and juvenile work gangs. The groups clean streets, paint over graffiti and bury the indigent in the county cemetery, providing \u201cthousands of dollars of free labor to the community,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cNo wonder Sheriff Arpaio has been profiled in over 4,500 U.S. and foreign newspapers, magazines and TV news programs,\u201d the office\u2019s website said. Arpaio also briefly starred in the FOX reality show, \u201cSmile: You\u2019re Under Arrest.\u201d It featured the sheriff and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants. Arpaio, 79, served in the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1953, and he was a police officer in Washington and Las Vegas before serving as a federal narcotics agent. He ended his Drug Enforcement Administration career as head of that federal agency for Arizona, according to his website. He and his wife have been married for more than 54 years and have four grandchildren. \u201cArpaio looks forward to many more years as sheriff of Maricopa County,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s website said.",

            "article_content": "Roberts says it seems the federal government doesn't want to know immigration status The solicitor general warns against state \"interference\" in immigration Justice Sotomayor says the federal government's case is \"not selling very well\" The court's ruling will affect similar laws in several other states Parts of Arizona\u2019s sweeping immigration law received a surprising amount of support from a short-handed Supreme Court Wednesday. States throughout the country considering their own tough immigration laws are closely following the proceedings over what has become a thorny issue. Fed up with illegal immigrants crossing from Mexico \u2013 and what they say is the federal government\u2019s inability to stop it \u2013 legislators in Arizona passed a tough immigration law. The federal government sued, saying that Arizona overreached. \u201cIf, in fact, somebody who does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona has no power?\u201d asked Justice Antonin Scalia. \u201cWhat does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?\u201d Phoenix cop calls Arizona's immigration law 'racist,' others say it's necessary 2010: What the AZ immigration law says 2010: Feds vs. state over immigration 2010: AZ governor signs immigration bill Even liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the federal governments\u2019 lawyer that key parts of his arguments were \u201cnot selling very well.\u201d Federal courts had blocked four elements of the state\u2019s Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, known as SB 1070. While intense oral arguments took place among the justices, outside there were competing demonstrations on the courthouse plaza, with the law\u2019s opponents saying it promotes discrimination and racial profiling. Backers say illegal immigration has created public safety and economic crises. At issue is whether states have any authority to step in to enforce immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional question is known as pre-emption. Other states watch for outcome Paul Clement, lawyer for Arizona, told the high court the federal government has long failed to control the problem, and that states have discretion to assist in enforcing immigration laws. But the Obama administration\u2019s solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, strongly countered that assertion, saying immigration matters are under the federal government\u2019s exclusive authority and state \u201cinterference\u201d would only make matters worse. Several other states followed Arizona\u2019s lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. Arizona\u2019s appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. Arizona is the nation\u2019s most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. Opinion: What if justices let states make immigration policy? Justice Elena Kagan did not hear this case. Before taking the bench last year, she had been involved in the administration\u2019s initial legal opposition to the law as solicitor general. A 4-4 high court split would be likely to keep the Arizona law in legal limbo, preventing the four provisions of the law from going into effect but not settling the larger constitutional questions. It would also shift the election-year fight over the issue to other states with current or pending crackdown laws. The four Arizona provisions on hold are: \u2013 A requirement that local police officers check a person\u2019s immigration status while enforcing other laws if \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d exists that the person is in the United States illegally. \u2013 A provision authorizing police to arrest immigrants without warrant where \u201cprobable cause\u201d exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country. \u2013 A section making it a state crime for \u201cunauthorized immigrants\u201d to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification. \u2013 A ban on those not authorized for employment in the United States to apply, solicit or perform work. That would include immigrants standing in a parking lot who \u201cgesture or nod\u201d their willingness to be employed. Although the specific question before the high court relates to the law\u2019s enforcement, the justices could use the appeal to address the broader constitutional questions. Mexican migration slows, but debate isn\u2019t over During the 70-minute arguments, Clement faced relatively little tough questioning from left-leaning members of the bench. \u201cThere will be a significant number of people who will be detained at the stop, or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time\u201d if the state law is allowed to be enforced, warned Justice Stephen Breyer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the provision on carrying registration is especially problematic. \u201cCongress enacted a complete registration scheme which the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary regulations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want the registration scheme to be wholly federal.\u201d But the consistently tough questions were aimed at Verrilli from conservative members of the high court. Even before the solicitor general began speaking midway through the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts framed the debate away from what has become a major complaint about the law: that it would target mostly Hispanic people for scrutiny and detention. \u201cI\u2019d like to clear up at the outset what it\u2019s not about,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNo part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?\u201d Verrilli readily agreed. Later the chief justice raised more serious concerns. When enforcing other law, \u201cthe person is already stopped for some other reason. He\u2019s stopped for going 60 in a 20 (mph zone). He\u2019s stopped for drunk driving. So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all. All that has to do with immigration law is whether or not they can ask the federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not, and then leave it up to you,\u201d Roberts said to Verrilli. \u201cIt seems to me that the federal government just doesn\u2019t want to know who is here illegally or not.\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy echoed the thought, suggesting the federal government is not doing enough on illegal immigration, which might give states discretion to intervene. Suppose, he offered, \u201cthe state of Arizona has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, residents leaving the state because of a flood of immigrants. Let\u2019s just assume those two things. Does that give the state of Arizona any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state wouldn\u2019t have?\u201d Kennedy was echoing what the state had long been arguing, and he later suggested there is such authority. Verrilli argued the law would hurt Washington\u2019s ability to carry out diplomatic relations with other nations, noting, \u201cWe have very significant issues on the border with Mexico.\u201d \u201cWell, can\u2019t you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people?\u201d Scalia asked. \u201cFree them from the jails and send them back to the countries that are objecting. What\u2019s the problem with that? \u201cWe have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d The Justice Department said Arizona\u2019s population of 2 million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or \u201cremovals\u201d involve Mexican nationals. A tale of opposing views in Arizona The court hearing over the illegal immigration law comes at an interesting time. The Pew Hispanic Center this week released a report that found that Mexican immigration to the United States has come to a standstill. The economic downturn in the United States and better conditions in Mexico, along with deportations and other enforcement, has led many to return to Mexico. However, the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants \u2013 from Mexico and other countries \u2013 continue to live in the United States. Even if immigration has slowed to lows not seen in decades, proponents of tough immigration laws want to beef up enforcement ahead of any future pressures. After the arguments, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer expressed hope the state would prevail at the high court. \u201cWe likely will not know the court\u2019s decision for weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am filled with optimism\u2013 the kind that comes with knowing that Arizona\u2019s cause is just and its course is true.\u201d The administration, backed by a variety of immigrant and civil rights groups, says allowing such discretionary state authority would hurt relations between the United States and other countries, disrupt existing cooperative efforts and unfairly target legal immigrants. The legislation has a variety of supporters and detractors. Republican lawmakers, outspoken Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and various state governments were among those filing briefs supporting the law. The Mexican government, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the city of Tucson, Arizona, were among those supporting the Justice Department\u2019s side. The outcome of the Arizona appeal could set important precedent on similar laws pending across the country. The case is Arizona v. U.S. (11-182) and is to be the last argued before the high court this term. A ruling could come in late June, just before the justices recess for the summer.",

            "article_content": "People on both sides have invested time and reputations in the legal fight Phoenix Police Officer David Salgado sees a threat to equal treatment Border resident Glenn Spencer and others monitor the boundary on their own No better symbol of the deep political and social divide over illegal immigration exists than here on the Mexico-U.S. border, along Glenn Spencer\u2019s rural desert property. And no better symbol exists of the contradictions and conundrums from an unresolved government enforcement policy. Halfway down the 104-acre ranch is the state-of-the-art border fence: 18-foot-high steel beams, buried 6 to 8 feet deep to discourage tunneling. Imposing and discouraging. But then the tall ribbon stops, replaced by easily breached, angled beams, no more than 3 feet high. And farther down, no fence at all where it crosses the heavily tree-lined San Pedro River. As dusk approaches, two U.S. Border Patrol pickup trucks amble separately along Spencer\u2019s backyard in search of illegal crossings, which have been slowed but not stopped by these human barriers. The abundant mesquite bushes with their inch-long thorns might prove a more effective screen. The story of the wall \u2013 looking in or looking out, depending on your point of view \u2013 is also the story of two opposing views, embodied by Spencer\u2019s border monitoring group and by Phoenix Police Officer David Salgado. Both have invested their time and reputations in a legal fight now before the U.S. Supreme Court: whether Arizona\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration unconstitutionally intrudes on the Obama administration\u2019s authority. The state law SB 1070 has become a flashpoint for a decades-long national debate over controlling the borders. What the justices decide in coming weeks will have broad implications in this election-year issue, but could also set new legal markers in the equally strident debate over state versus federal power. David Salgado: \u201cIt\u2019s a racist law\u201d For more than two decades, Salgado has been a self-described beat cop in the historic Garfield neighborhood, one of the oldest in Arizona\u2019s capital. As he walked the streets of the mostly Hispanic community with CNN, almost everyone greeted him by name. He said that rapport has helped build trust, and helped solve crimes. But the officer worries the new act may destroy all that. \u201cAfter the law went up, many didn\u2019t want to look at us anymore,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey were just afraid, and that brought division between the police and the Hispanic community.\u201d Salgado was one of the first to sue the state in federal court, trying to block SB 1070 from taking effect. He said he would be forced to detain and question people based on their ethnicity, exposing him to civil lawsuits, something the legislation allows. \u201cI can be sued if I act; I can be sued if I don\u2019t act.\u201d 2010: AZ governor signs immigration bill 2010: What the AZ immigration law says 2010: Feds vs. state over immigration \u201cIt\u2019s a racist law because it basically picks and chooses certain people, and I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said on a recent morning. \u201cI took an oath 20 years ago that said I\u2019m going to enforce all laws and treat everyone equal. \u2026 But I can\u2019t treat Hispanics equally because I\u2019m going to have to profile them.\u201d State officials strongly assert racial profiling would not be tolerated, and a state board has been created to set uniform enforcement standards. The law\u2019s backers say police officers are professionals and stopping crime is based on conduct, not skin color or ethnic background. Other groups filing suit include clergy members, concerned their desert border rescues of illegal crossers, and even neighborhood day care transportation of young Hispanic-Americans, would leave them susceptible to random police suspicion and detention. Salgado\u2019s attorney, Stephen Montoya of Phoenix, says some state officials, including Gov. Jan Brewer, are exaggerating the immigration \u201ccrisis.\u201d \u201cThe whole rhetoric that Arizona is some kind of war zone isn\u2019t borne out,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with state law enforcement officers enforcing federal immigration law if they do so in accordance with federal immigration law, if they get the certification and training required from (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement), if they get the supervision required by federal law from ICE. But unilaterally doing that without any federal involvement? That is a recipe for destruction, and the state has already seen that.\u201d Salgado, who was born in Texas but has lived in Phoenix since age 5, admits his opposition to the law has also divided law enforcement, creating stress with some fellow officers questioning his motives. The city\u2019s union for police officers as well as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio aggressively lobbied for SB 1070. Recently retired Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris is among law enforcement leaders who remain critics. \u201cThe federal government is not doing its job\u201d stemming illegal immigration, Salgado said. \u201cBut when they (state officials) want us to do their job, and where kids are being separated from their parents (in police sweeps), it\u2019s horrible. And that just bothers me as a human being.\u201d He cites as another example his 78-year-old mother, a U.S. citizen like him. \u201cIf she gets nervous, that\u2019s all she\u2019ll do, she\u2019ll speak Spanish. So if she\u2019s driving a car and an officer stops her, that\u2019s all she\u2019s gonna speak, Spanish. And if she hands over her Arizona driver\u2019s license, and our computers are down, well, they can\u2019t verify it. So that officer has a right, under that law, to take my mother from the car to the station to fingerprint her to find out if she\u2019s legal or not. \u201cAnd that becomes personal to me,\u201d Salgado said, getting emotional. \u201cBecause there are many citizens here, especially in Phoenix, Arizona, where they don\u2019t speak English. But they are citizens, and that\u2019s going to violate their rights as an American.\u201d Glenn Spencer: \u201cYou had better protect the people\u201d Some 220 miles south of the capital, the high desert views are spectacular. Isolated orange-colored mountains, saguaro cactus, and javelinas \u2013 pig-like native hoofed mammals \u2013 brighten the arid landscape. Glenn Spencer\u2019s laptop helps provide panoramic vistas, thanks to several cameras mounted on a 46-foot pole next to his ranch house. It is part of a high-tech monitoring system he set up as founder of the privately run American Border Patrol. He says its members are watching because the federal government has not been doing its job. Volunteers, some hundreds of miles away, can use Spencer\u2019s website to spot illegal immigrants and smugglers along a 20-mile stretch, reporting what they see to border protection officials. Spencer \u2013 a retired systems engineer and businessman \u2013 claims that not only the 18-foot wall, but also the smaller barriers abutting his property were put up a couple of years ago by the federal government, after the ABP exposed what were nightly border crossings numbering sometimes in the hundreds. \u201cIt used to be the Wild West, and now it\u2019s gated community here, so I look at that wall and I feel somewhat safe,\u201d which he says is not true of other border regions. Spencer firmly believes his group and the state can and should be assisting the federal government in what he labels a local and national problem. \u201cI think the Supreme Court has to stand up and say (to Washington): \u2018You had better protect the people, and they\u2019re going to protect themselves if you\u2019re not doing your job,\u2019\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to make sure the federal government gets all the help it needs to do the job. You\u2019ve got to do better but you haven\u2019t done it. We\u2019re going to let the states help you out.\u201d ABP engineer Mike King showed off the group\u2019s latest technological advance: what it calls the Sonic Barrier, which can detect humans, vehicles, even aircraft moving within 300 feet of the Mexican border. \u201cIt\u2019s a seismic line that we lay out, and it can be stretched out for an infinite number of miles, and it will detect every single thing that crosses it,\u201d King said. \u201cIt is user-friendly, it doesn\u2019t require a ton of manpower to be watching this, because the sensors do the job for you.\u201d Using solar panels, batteries and digital converters that could someday be linked along 5-mile increments, continually streaming images are sent to a central monitoring site. The cameras are also thermal and can be operated in the dark. King demonstrated by having local Arizona residents walk along the border as test subjects. As they approached the metal fence, a red light and loud siren went off on King\u2019s computer in the ranch offices, alerting the intruders\u2019 presence. Spencer has testified before state committees, trying to get officials to adopt the technology, which he claims would be much cheaper than \u201cvirtual fence\u201d systems being developed by the feds. Spotter planes \u2013 including an unmanned \u201cBorder Hawk\u201d equipped with cameras providing 360-degree digital cameras views \u2013 are also used by ABP, a nonprofit funded mostly by small individual contributions. The group\u2019s work has been criticized by those claiming Spencer and his associates are self-appointed vigilantes, with a virulent anti-immigrant and anti-federal bias. But he broadly pronounces that American civilization is at risk, from security and economic standpoints, because of illegal immigration. \u201cI have nothing against Mexico or Mexicans, but when you import poverty on a massive scale, and you have a population of people who are far below the standard base of income of Americans, you can only expect to run into serious problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is necessary for the state to assist our (federal) government to enforce our law. We are a nation of laws, and I think the state of Arizona wants to make sure it remains that way.\u201d A point of agreement: The issues are complex Both Spencer and Salgado agree the federal government is not doing enough to stem illegal immigration. They also recognize the complexity of the issues, and neither claims to have all the answers. But they disagree on what \u201chelp\u201d is needed. Groups and individuals filing legal briefs to the Supreme Court \u2013 both for and against the law \u2013 number in the hundreds: lawmakers, religious leaders, cities, and issue advocates. SB 1070\u2019s opponents use words like hate, fear, and extremism to describe its effects. Supporters call it patriotic, reasonable, and necessary. Each side brings a unique perspective that must now be sorted out by the high court. What the justices say will be the final word of sorts, but for a border activist and Phoenix cop, the stakes are personal, and will be felt firsthand for years. \u201cThis is the community I was brought up in,\u201d Salgado said of Phoenix. \u201cThis is where I belong.\u201d CNN correspondent Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Federal courts have blocked four key parts of Arizona's law It would require police to check to immigration status if there is \"reasonable suspicion\" The justices could use the appeal to address broad constitutional questions Arizona is the nation's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration The Supreme Court is poised to decide whether Arizona can enforce its controversial immigration law over the strong objections of the Obama administration. Oral arguments will be held Wednesday. A ruling during a presidential election year could generate renewed political attention on an issue that has been building in intensity in recent years. Federal courts have blocked four key parts of the state\u2019s Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, known as SB 1070. Arizona has argued that illegal immigration is creating financial hardships and safety concerns for its residents, and that the federal government has long failed to control the problem. The administration has countered by saying immigration issues are under its exclusive authority and state \u201cinterference\u201d would only make matters worse. The southwest state is the nation\u2019s most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. Arizonan rancher and police officer on opposing sides of the issue Justice Elena Kagan will not hear this case, because as solicitor general, before taking the bench last year, she had been involved in the administration\u2019s initial legal opposition to the law. A 4-4 high court split would be likely to keep the Arizona law in legal limbo, preventing the four provisions of the law from going into effect, but not settling the larger constitutional questions. It would also shift the election-year fight over the issue to other states with current or pending crackdown laws. The four Arizona provisions currently on hold are: \u2013 A requirement that local police officers check a person\u2019s immigration status while enforcing other laws, if \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d exists that the person is in the United States illegally. \u2013 A provision authorizing police to arrest immigrants without warrant where \u201cprobable cause\u201d exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country. \u2013 A section making it a state crime for \u201cunauthorized immigrants\u201d to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification. \u2013 A ban on those not authorized for employment in the United States to apply, solicit or perform work. That would include immigrants standing in a parking lot who \u201cgesture or nod\u201d their willingness to be employed. Although the specific question before the high court relates to the law\u2019s enforcement, the justices could use the appeal to address the broader constitutional questions. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah and South Carolina. Arizona\u2019s appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said she is confident the high court will rule for the state. \u201cThis case is not just about Arizona. It\u2019s about every state grappling with the costs of illegal immigration. And it\u2019s about the fundamental principle of federalism, under which these states have a right to defend their people,\u201d the Republican governor said in a statement released after the Supreme Court agreed to decide the matter. \u201cArizona has been more than patient waiting for Washington to secure the border. Decades of federal inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation and states deserve clarity from the court in terms of what role they have in fighting illegal immigration.\u201d At issue is whether states have any authority to step in to enforce immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional question is known as \u201cpre-emption.\u201d Arizona officials will tell the justices they are merely assisting and cooperating with federal authorities, action they say Congress has blessed. But the administration \u2013 backed by a variety of immigrant and civil rights groups \u2013 says allowing such state authority would hurt relations between the United States and other countries, disrupt existing cooperative efforts and unfairly target legal immigrants. In a rhetorical rematch of last month\u2019s separate arguments over the Obama-backed health care reform law, private attorney Paul Clement will make the case for Arizona while Solicitor General Donald Verrilli will articulate the federal government\u2019s position. The legislation has a variety of supporters and detractors. Republican lawmakers, outspoken Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and various state governments were among those filing briefs supporting the law. The Mexican government, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the city of Tucson, Arizona, were among those supporting the Justice Department\u2019s side. In its petition to the high court, Arizona says it is the nation\u2019s busiest illegal entry point, with many people streaming in from neighboring Mexico. \u201cArizona bears the brunt of the problems caused by illegal immigration. It is the gateway for nearly half of the nation\u2019s illegal border crossings,\u201d said state officials. \u201cBeyond the obvious safety issues, the fiscal burdens imposed by the disproportionate impact of illegal immigration on Arizona are daunting. Arizona spends several hundred million dollars each year incarcerating criminal aliens and providing education and health care to aliens who entered and reside in the country in violation of federal law.\u201d Civil rights and minority groups\u2013 as well as some law enforcement agencies\u2013 worry the law would only encourage racial profiling, drain vital and scarce law enforcement resources, hamper investigation of more serious crimes, and cripple relations with immigrant communities. In a CNN/ORC International poll last fall, 52% of those surveyed said illegal immigration was extremely or very important to their vote for president. But a similar poll in March showed only 4% saying it is the most important issue facing the United States today, while 53% said the economy is the top issue. While a federal judge in 2010 stopped enforcement of the most controversial provisions, other parts of SB 1070 were given the go-ahead, including a ban on \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d or municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. Judge Susan Bolton\u2019s ruling also allowed a provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic. And her order allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants to take effect. A federal appeals court in San Francisco subsequently sided with the Justice Department, largely on the argument that federal immigration policy \u2013 as well as America\u2019s standing in the world \u2013 would be greatly undermined if individual states adopted their own separate immigration laws. Doing so, the court concluded, essentially meant a given state would be adopting its own foreign policy, one that may be in opposition to national policy. \u201cThat 50 individual states or one individual state should have a foreign policy is absurdity too gross to be entertained. In matters affecting the intercourse of the federal nation with other nations, the federal nation must speak with one voice,\u201d Circuit Judge John Noonan wrote in a concurring opinion. The Arizona appeal could set important precedent on similar laws pending across the country. In the first half of 2011, state legislatures in all 50 states and Puerto Rico have introduced a record number of bills or resolutions relating to immigrants or refugees, according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Through June, states had introduced 1,592 such bills or resolutions, compared to 300 in 2005. The case is Arizona v. U.S. (11-182) and is to be the last argued before the high court this term. A ruling could come in late June, just before the justices recess for the summer.",

            "article_content": "University of Texas defends its admissions policy Arguments before Supreme Court will be held in the fall The case will be one of several controversial matters the court is hearing The University of Texas says race is one of several factors considered for admission The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to tackle another election-year blockbuster and will decide whether the University of Texas\u2019 race-conscious admission policies violate the rights of white applicants. If health care reform, illegal immigration crackdowns, voting rights and TV indecency were not enough, the court is poised to add to its high-profile docket, wading into the divisive issue of state-mandated racial diversity and affirmative action. Oral arguments would be held this fall, ensuring the court \u2013 however it decides the appeal \u2013 will be a major campaign issue. A ruling, however, will not likely be issued until early 2013. Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors \u2013 such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience \u2013 designed to create a diverse campus. The high court has had an evolving record on the discretion of state officials to decide who attends their institutions. The justices in 2003 said state universities can narrowly tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant\u2019s race. That landmark case from the University of Michigan is the subject of current but separate appeals over a state ballot measure designed to eliminate any racial criteria. A divided federal appeals court in July concluded the voter-approved ban on \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d at public colleges and universities was unconstitutional, and \u201calters Michigan\u2019s political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities.\u201d The Texas case is complicated over the issue of \u201cstanding\u201d and whether Fisher should even be allowed to bring her lawsuit. She graduates this spring from Louisiana State University, where she went after being rejected by the University of Texas \u2013 and Texas officials had argued she would then have no live controversy or claim necessary for the high court to intervene. They said her only \u201charm\u201d would be trying to recoup nonrefundable application fees. In accepting the case, the high court made no mention of whether the standing issue would affect its ultimate ruling. The court also announced Justice Elena Kagan will not participate in the case since she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration\u2019s solicitor general before joining the high court. That leaves the possibility of a 4-4 ruling, meaning Fisher would not prevail and leaving undecided the larger constitutional questions presented. Fisher\u2019s attorneys made the strategic decision to sue as an individual instead of bringing a class-action discrimination claim, which would have made it easier in some respects. Groups opposed to the state\u2019s policies applauded the court\u2019s decision to get involved. \u201cUsing race in admissions decisions, to achieve diversity, amounts to stereotyping people by their race,\u201d said Joshua Thompson of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed a legal brief in support of Fisher. \u201cRacial diversity in a student body does not guarantee a diversity of experience and perspectives. It is unrealistic and wrong to try to pigeonhole people by their race.\u201d In a statement issued after the high court agreed to hear the case, the University of Texas defended its admissions process, saying \u201cit is vital for the university to weigh a multitude of factors when making admissions decisions about the balance of students who will make up each entering class.\u201d \u201cWe must have the flexibility to consider each applicant\u2019s unique experiences and background so we can provide the best environment in which to educate and train the students who will be our nation\u2019s future leaders,\u201d the statement said. At the time, the state of Texas provided automatic admission to its flagship university for in-state students finishing in the top 10% of their high schools. Fisher just missed that opportunity, so had to compete in the larger pool of students seeking admission to the highly competitive school. The state has since narrowed that admissions window to the top 8%. The Michigan case was divisive in 2003, with Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor the swing vote. \u201cIn order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThe (Michigan) Law School\u2019s educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer.\u201d But Justice Clarence Thomas was among four conservative justices who found the policies unconstitutional. \u201cThe Law School, of its own choosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy.\u201d Despite that high court ruling, some states, including California, do not allow race considerations in college admissions. The issue now before an arguably more conservative high court is whether the Texas policies should be re-evaluated, as states have had nearly a decade to put such diversity considerations into place. It also gives greater intensity to the Supreme Court overall in an election year. The justices next month will take on a challenge to the health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama, perhaps the biggest issue the court has tackled since the dispute over the 2000 presidential election. In April, Arizona\u2019s controversial illegal immigration law will be argued. Legal analysts say the justices will publicly avoid the politics of these hot-button issues, and focus on the law, but many said they wonder what long-term effect these cases will have on the judiciary\u2019s reputation. \u201cWe\u2019re in a little bit of a political death spiral for the Supreme Court, as ideologues in politics, on the left and right, attack justices with whom they disagree, maybe decreasing the public\u2019s confidence in the Supreme Court,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington lawyer and publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. \u201cAnd as they take up health care, affirmative action, abortion \u2013 cases (that) inevitably are going to be coming, immigration \u2013 all of those issues \u2013 there are going to be more excuses to attack the justices, which is unfair and sad, but we don\u2019t yet see a way out.\u201d",

            "article_content": "By the CNN Wire Staff (CNN) \u2013 The number of anti-government groups in the United States grew dramatically in 2011 for a third year, fueled by a rising tide against President Barack Obama, the struggling economy and illegal immigration, a report released Thursday finds. The three-year trend amounts to an \u201castounding\u201d 755% growth since 2008, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center report \u201cThe Year in Hate & Extremism: The Patriot Movement Explodes.\u201d The report attributes the growth to \u201csuperheated fears generated by economic dislocation, the changing racial makeup of America, and the prospect of four more years under a black president who many on the far right view as an enemy to their country.\u201d Since its start in 1994, the so-called Patriot Movement has fluctuated in size based on political events \u2013 peaking in 1996 after the Oklahoma City bombing before fading to relative obscurity in 2000, according to the report. Its most recent rise can be traced to late 2008 \u2013 the start of the economy\u2019s collapse and the election of Obama as president. \u201cEven as most of the nation cheered the election of the first black president that November, an angry backlash developed that included several plots to murder Obama,\u201d the report says. \u201cMany Americans, infused with populist fury over bank and auto bailouts and a feeling that they had lost their country, joined Patriot groups.\u201d The SPLC pointed out a particularly alarming rise in the \u201csovereign citizens movement,\u201d what it calls a subset of the Patriot Movement. \u201cSovereign citizens, whose ideology first developed in white supremacist groups, generally do not believe they are obliged to pay federal taxes, follow most laws, or comply with requirements for driver\u2019s licenses and vehicle registrations,\u201d the report says. \u201cThey also typically believe that filing certain documents can relieve them of debt or bankruptcy proceedings or even bring them millions of dollars from secret government accounts.\u201d High-profile arrests have been made in recent years to stop alleged plots against law enforcement officers from being carried out by suspected militia groups: \u2013 Nine members of the Michigan-based Hutaree militia were arrested and charged in March 2010 with seditious conspiracy, attempted use of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 weapons of mass destruction, teaching the use of explosive materials and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence. The government said alleged ringleader David Stone Sr.\u2019s plan was to create his own country carved out of four Michigan counties, then defend that country against attack by the \u201cOne World Order\u201d army. The group allegedly planned to incite that attack by making a false 911 complaint, shooting any police who responded and then attacking attendees at the funerals of those officers with improvised explosive devices. \u2013 An alleged plan by followers of the Alaska Peacemakers Militia to kill state troopers and a judge was thwarted in March, according to the SPLC. \u2013 Four men were arrested in November in an alleged plot to kill government workers and produce a deadly biotoxin to spread on highways in several major U.S. cities. FBI agents identified them as part of a fringe militia group. In addition to the rise in anti-government groups, the number of hate groups operating in the United States also grew in 2011, though less dramatically, from 1,002 in 2010 to 1,018 last year. Bucking that trend, however, was a substantial drop in the number of \u201cnativist extremist\u201d groups \u2013 \u201corganizations that go beyond normal political activist to harass individuals they suspect of being undocumented immigrants.\u201d That drop, the report says, can be attributed in part to an increase in hard-line anti-illegal immigration legislation in states such as Alabama and Arizona. Still, the report warns that the American radical right movement could continue to grow if Obama is re-elected to a second term. \u201cIf he wins re-election next fall, the reaction of the extreme right, already angry and on the defensive as the white population diminishes, could be truly frightening,\u201d the report concludes.

Two days after NAACP President Ben Jealous \u2013 along with organizer the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson \u2013 were joined by thousands of people, both young and old, to mark the 47th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, their journey through Alabama continues. Participants say this year \u2013 an election year \u2013 is about more than just remembering, it\u2019s about raising consciousness. \u201cRight now, we are seeing the Voting Rights Act attacked more consistently across the country than we have seen since it was passed.\u201d Jealous said. Since crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Sunday, marchers are continuing on to Montgomery to bring attention to what they call a modern-day attack on voting rights. \u201cWe need people to understand that not only is history not very distant, but we stand on the precipice of repeating it,\u201d Jealous said. The NAACP leader said strict voter ID laws that won\u2019t allow people to vote without a driver\u2019s license or passport are unnecessary and will make it difficult \u2013 and in some cases impossible \u2013 for 5 million people to vote. \u201cWe need to make sure that the principle of one person, one vote, is respected,\u201d he said. New marchers \u2013 including a Latina student from Idaho who came with other members of a campus organization called Movimiento Activista Social, and senior citizens from Boston \u2013 all made the trip to Alabama to fight voting restrictions nationwide. Some older activists came to relive a turbulent time in American history. As a girl, Amelia Boynton, who was born in 1911, sent a letter to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. asking him to participate in the march. This time, she couldn\u2019t make the journey on foot, so Boynton is being driven along the route. She is joined by another elderly woman who was 11 and a member of the NAACP youth council on March 7, 1965. On that day, protesters fighting for the right to vote tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and were beaten back by police officers and attacked by dogs. The brutal attack became known as Bloody Sunday. This month, the Alabama House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution to gather and preserve a collection of accounts from current and former members of Congress who were involved in civil rights marches in the state. Jealous agrees that is important that people know and remember the legacy of Selma. \u201cWe need people to know what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need students to know that people risked their lives.\u201d Participants will have walked more than 20 miles by the end of day Tuesday. Once the walking ends, marchers will gather for the evening at Macedonia Church and sleep on cots, NAACP spokesman Derek Turner said. The march, which was primarily organized by the National Action Network with support from the NAACP, AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, National Council of La Raza and other groups, is expected to end Friday on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery  with a call to repeal voter ID laws and Alabama\u2019s HB56, a strict anti-immigration law.",

Follow @cnnlia for more updates on other Latino in America stories. By Rafael Romo, Senior Latin American Affairs Editor (CNN) \u2013 If there was still any doubt about Mitt Romney\u2019s position on immigration, it was erased last Thursday during the CNN Republican presidential debate in Mesa, Arizona. The former Michigan governor referred to Arizona\u2019s controversial HB1070 law as \u201ca model\u201d for the nation. The initiative approved in 2010 that cracks down on illegal immigration has been denounced by Hispanic and immigration rights groups as extreme. Romney also said that \u201cthe right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona \u2026 I\u2019ll also complete the (border) fence. I\u2019ll make sure we have enough border patrol agents to secure the fence and I\u2019ll make sure we have an (employment eligibility federal database) E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers.\u201d Hispanic voters won\u2019t decide Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Arizona and Michigan, because few are registered as Republicans in those states; but it will be an entirely different story during the November presidential elections. Arizona\u2019s Hispanic voters could give the candidate of either party enough of a margin to win the state in November. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, Arizona has 766,000 eligible Hispanic voters, close to 20% of all eligible voters in the Grand Canyon state. Making statements that can be perceived as anti-immigrant is risky, according to Jennifer Sevilla-Korn, the executive director of the Hispanic Leadership Network, a center-right advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. \u201cTone and rhetoric absolutely matter, because the use of language that can be perceived as inflammatory turns the Hispanic community off even if they agree with the candidate on other issues like how to deal with the economy and fiscal responsibility,\u201d Sevilla-Korn said. Mark Lopez, associate director at the Pew Hispanic Center, said, \u201cLatinos have played a growing and important role in the nation\u2019s presidential elections over the last few election cycles. There are now more than 21 million Hispanics who are eligible to vote, and Latinos reside in some key states.\u201d According to the U.S. Census, in the 2008 presidential election, Latinos represented 13% of all voters in Colorado, 14% in Nevada, 15% in Florida, and 38% in New Mexico. Those four states will likely be swing states again in 2012. \u201cEven the participation rate among Hispanics in presidential elections has been growing\u201d in those states, says Lopez. In 2004, former President George W. Bush won more than 40% of the Latino vote. Four years later, 67% of Hispanic voters went for Barack Obama. Experts say anybody getting that kind of support from Latinos next year, whether Democrat or Republican, has a good chance of winning the presidency. Florida-based political analyst Charles Garcia says he\u2019s confident Latino voters will decide the U.S. presidential election in 2012. He points to states like North Carolina, where the number of registered Hispanic voters has almost doubled to more than 130,000 since the last presidential election. \u201cPresident Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by 14,000 votes,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cIn 2008 there were 68,000 registered Latino voters and a whopping 84% of them participated in the election.\u201d According to research done by the CNN Political Team, based on U.S. Census figures there will be 15 swing states in the 2012 presidential elections: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. In a tight race, Garcia said, Hispanic voters could be the margin of victory in 12 of the 15 swing states. The reason? The number of eligible Latino voters in those states has grown by more than 700,000 in the last four years. \u201cSo the important message for the Latino community that\u2019s living in one of these 15 swing states is \u2018Get off your couch and go register to vote because you\u2019re going to determine the next election\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s powerful,\u201d Garcia said. On the Democratic side, Garcia points out, President Obama hasn\u2019t delivered on a promise he made while campaigning: comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done is he has deported 400,000 immigrants a year \u2013 a total of 1.2 million so far \u2013 and he hasn\u2019t delivered on the Dream Act,\u201d Garcia said. The Dream Act is a bill that would give a path towards citizenship to undocumented young people attending college or serving in the armed forces. As the GOP primaries play out and as the focus shifts toward the general election in November, Latino voters likely will find themselves more and more the focus of candidates\u2019 attention in those key swing states. Which candidate will get those voters\u2019 attention in the polling booth is a question that will be answered in the weeks and months ahead.",

By Nick Valencia, CNN (CNN) - It\u2019s a Thursday in early February, and Fernando Romero, the Godfather of Latino politics in Nevada, is stressed out. Two days ago, Ruben Kihuen, the Democrat who was trying to become the state\u2019s first ever Latino congressman announced he was dropping out of the race. \u201cIt\u2019s a big let down for the community,\u201d Romero says of Kihuen\u2019s decision. \u201cThe [Latino] voters were inspired to come out to vote, but right now we\u2019re finding it difficult to burn a fire under their butts.\u201d Nevada\u2019s Latino population grew 81 percent from 2000 to 2010, and many here thought this candidate and this race would be their chance to flex some new political muscle and be represented by one of their own. \u201cWe were hanging our coats on him,\u201d Romero says of Kihuen. Turns out a lot of people were \u201changing their coats\u201d on this little-known newcomer who went from 9-year old immigrant from Mexico to invited guest at the president\u2019s most recent State of the Union address. Democratic strategists hoped the excitement surrounding his race would lead to big Latino voter turnout that would in turn help President Obama\u2019s bid for a second term. Latino voters across the country, not just in Nevada, are this presidential election\u2019s \u201cFlorida Florida Florida.\u201d Both parties\u2014and the national media\u2014are focusing on this group, waiting to see how or if they will vote in November. This week\u2019s cover story in Time Magazine, \u201cWhy Latino Voters Will Swing the 2012 Election\u201d says it\u2019s a numbers game. Andres Ramirez, an architect of the Kihuen campaign is also the National Vice Chair of the DNC\u2019s Hispanic Caucus. He says there has been an increase of 2 million Latino voters nationally for every presidential cycle since 1996. In 2008, roughly 85% of Nevada Latinos turned out to vote for President Obama, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. That record number propelled the freshman senator to win a state that voted for George W. Bush four years earlier. In 2012, 1 in 4 constituents in the state of Nevada are Latino, representing 15% of all registered voters. With a majority of those voters registered Democrat, Ramirez says the numbers are in place to help the party keep Nevada from going red in 2012. Other states with a large or growing Latino population paint a similar picture. The numbers are there and Latino voters are ready to be persuaded, but it\u2019s not clear whether it will be the Republican candidate or President Obama who will have the message and the platform that resonates strongest. Much has changed in Nevada since 2008, and according to Romero, who is the president of the non-partisan group \u201cHispanics in Politics,\u201d Latinos in Nevada are now \u201cdisillusioned\u201d and \u201cuninspired\u201d with regard to President Obama. With Kihuen out of the race, Romero says that could spell trouble for Obama\u2019s re-election bid in a key battleground state. \u201cThe president just isn\u2019t doing it,\u201d Romero says of Obama. Otto Merida, the CEO and founder of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, agrees that President Obama should not assume that Latinos will back him again this time. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Latino voters will vote for a Republican for president in 2012\u2026it\u2019s that they won\u2019t come out to vote at all.\u201d A registered Republican, Merida says even he feels the fallout of the end of the Kihuen campaign. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that Ruben dropped out. He produced a lot of excitement, even for Republican Latinos. He had the youth out on a Saturday, knocking on 3,000 [doors] or something. I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\u201d Merida and Romero both collaborated on Kihuen\u2019s campaign. The crossing of party lines among the Latino community leaders highlights the priority for both men: mobilizing the Latino vote in Nevada. No stranger to working with Democrats, Merida says he \u201cgot caught up in the hope\u201d and voted for President Obama in 2008. He doesn\u2019t plan to vote for him again this time around. Brookings Institution fellow and political analyst David Damore agrees that Nevada will be competitive in 2012, attributing that largely to the power of the Latino vote. \u201cNevada has the large concentration of Latinos; it\u2019s a fast growing state for that demographic. But the state is a place very much so in flux,\u201d Damore says. \u201cIt was a pretty Republican state, but it\u2019s swinging. You have a lot of grass roots groups mobilizing.\u201d Ramirez, Kihuen\u2019s former campaign manager is still confident Latinos will show up. He points to \u201ctwo natural things: growth within the Latino community [in Nevada] and increased efforts around new voter registration.\u201d He told CNN by phone that \u201cthe fear that Latinos won\u2019t come out to vote is being exaggerated. It\u2019s been a concern for every election cycle, but nothing shows Latinos won\u2019t turn out.\u201d Damore of the Brookings Institution adds, \u201c[Latinos] are going to be disillusioned with Obama and Ruben was a fairly charismatic guy to help supplement the vote, but the Dems don\u2019t have to deliver much when the candidate running against them is fiercely anti-immigrant. My guess is [Latinos] may not love what Obama\u2019s done, but then they\u2019ll look at the alternative and vote for Obama.\u201d Merida believes the uncertainty currently brewing in the battleground state is a case study of what the Obama re-election team will face across the country. \u201cThe problem is many people want the Hispanic community to have one issue, which is immigration. That\u2019s very important, but at this time our economy and education is paramount to what\u2019s going on. Those are big issues that affect the whole country, including Hispanics. In southern Nevada, for instance, we have a 50% dropout rate in high school for Hispanic students. We need more state resources for our teachers, and so forth,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou can look at what goes on here and you can see where the country will go,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat validates Nevada is we have a community here that represents the country. In terms of our Hispanic percentages, Black percentages, and other minority groups, we are the country. We represent the country.\u201d",

By Rafael Romo, Senior Latin American Affairs Editor (CNN) \u2013 It\u2019s a greeting that always makes Mark Jobe smile: \u201cI really loved today\u2019s Mass, Father Mark.\u201d Jobe is the senior pastor of New Life Community Church, which has 14 campuses across Chicago and its suburbs. He said he hears those words at least once a month, usually from newcomers \u2013 Hispanics raised in the Catholic faith who\u2019ve started attending his non-denominational Christian church. When Jobe launched New Life Community Church 25 years ago, the Midway neighborhood where his main campus is located was primarily populated by descendants of Polish, Lithuanian and Italian immigrants. Now, the neighborhood is primarily Hispanic. Jobe estimates that as much as 70% of New Life\u2019s 6,000 members are Hispanic. \u201cThey don\u2019t typically undermine [the church] where they came from,\u201d Jobe said. \u201cThey value the tradition, but what they often tell me is that they were not learning as much about the Bible and how it relates to their life today.\u201d The shift at New Life Community Church in Chicago is a reflection of a national trend, according to Luis Lugo, director of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. \u201cWhile three-quarters of first-generation Hispanics [in the United States] are Catholic, the percentage for second- and third-generation Latinos goes down to less than 60%,\u201d Lugo said. \u201cGeneration makes a huge difference. Later generations are much more likely to be converts.\u201d Why does it matter? According to the Pew Forum, there are key political differences among Latinos based on their religious preference. Hispanic Catholics tend to vote Democrat by a two-to-one margin while Evangelicals and Pentecostals are evenly split between the two parties. In 2004, then President George W. Bush won 60% of the Latino evangelicals, a percentage that political parties are likely to pay attention to as they develop their strategy for the 2012 presidential election. Hispanic evangelicals and Pentecostals tend to be more politically active than Catholics, have higher rates of citizenship and exercise their right to vote. As more than 150 conservative Christian leaders will take part in a two-day meeting this weekend to consider unifying their support behind one Republican candidate. The leaders include well-known evangelicals such as Focus on the Family founder James Dobson and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, but also the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. Politically speaking, Pew\u2019s Lugo describes Latino evangelicals as \u201cbig government, social conservatives.\u201d They tend to favor strong education, jobs and health programs, even above immigration. Still, they are staunchly conservative when it comes to issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. The Catholic church is taking note that attracting Latino churchgoers isn\u2019t just a matter of hosting Spanish-language services. Alejandro Aguilera-Titus, director of Hispanic ministry for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt\u201d that second- and third-generation Latinos are not flocking to the Catholic church the way their parents did. But he says in recent years the conference has launched a number of initiatives to attract them. In Miami, a program called J\u00f3venes Para Cristo, or Youth for Christ, is part of the outreach effort, along with Pascua Juvenil, or Easter Youth, in southern California. Both initiatives focus on personalizing religious experiences and emphasizing the Holy Spirit and \u201ca joyful expression of faith\u201d through music \u2013 much like evangelical churches. \u201cFor many years, it was assumed that [Hispanic] kids would just assimilate into the existing programs for children and youth and that was the wrong assumption to make,\u201d Aguilera-Titus said. Jobe, the Chicago pastor, was born in Indiana, but grew up in Costa Rica and Spain with missionary parents. Fluent Spanish makes it easier for him to relate to Hispanic newcomers, he said, but most of the Latinos attending his church are second- or third-generation Hispanics who preserve their ancestors\u2019 culture, but no longer speak their language. \u201cA lot of them are like my wife, Dee,\u201d Jobe said. \u201cHer grandparents came from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. Her parents spoke Spanish as a second language and the kids know a few words in Spanish, but none of them really speaks the language.\u201d Nicole Sandoval Williams, 29, is a Latina Los Angeles native who was raised Catholic, but became a born-again Christian in college. She felt the religion of her parents and grandparents was no longer relevant, which led her to consider some different ideas. \u201cAs a third-generation Mexican-American, I was not as connected to my roots as my parents and grandparents,\u201d Sandoval Williams said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to find out for yourself what you believe in.\u201d",

But what else will be front and center in the New Year? By the Numbers: Politics in 2013 Here are five other things to keep your eyes on: 1. Gun control: The shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, have moved gun control to the top of the \u201cto do\u201d list for the White House and many in Congress. While past mass killings have stirred talk of gun control, the killing of 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School by a man armed with a semi-automatic rifle seems to have changed public opinion. The wild ride to Election Day \u201cA discussion has reemerged as to what we might do not only to deter mass mass shootings in the future but to reduce the epidemic of gun violence that plagues this country every single day and it\u2019s encouraging that people of all different backgrounds and beliefs and political persuasions have been willing to challenge some old assumptions and change long-standing positions. That conversation has to continue but this time, the words need to lead to action,\u201d said the president, vowing to take action. Obama: Proposals to address gun violence due by January The president tapped Vice President Joe Biden to head a task force to report back in a month on ways to prevent future mass shootings. \u201cThis is not some Washington commission.  This is not something where folks are gonna be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside.  This is a team that has a very specific task to pull together real reforms right now,\u201d added the president. Obama:  \u2018Something fundamental in America has to change\u2019 While there\u2019s action Obama can take through executive orders, the big question centers on what Congress will do and whether lawmakers will buck the National Rifle Association and push through new gun control measures early in 2013. 2. Immigration reform: It may take a slight back seat due to the elementary school shootings and the new emphasis by the White House on gun control, but add illegal immigration reform to Obama\u2019s \u201cto do\u201d list in 2013. At a news conference in November soon after his re-election, the president said that he expected an immigration reform bill would be introduced soon after his inauguration, adding that \u201cwe need to seize the moment.\u201d Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform Obama told reporters that he hoped for a comprehensive bill that would include border security, enforcement measures for companies that employ undocumented workers, and resolving the status of the 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States. \u201cI am very confident we can get immigration reform done,\u201d added the president. And this time around, he may have support from some Republican lawmakers, who acknowledge that after their crushing defeat by the president among Latino voters in the November election (National exit polls indicate the president captured more than 70% of the Latino vote), it\u2019s time for the GOP to consider compromise on the issue of immigration reform. 3. Future of the GOP: As Republicans try to rebound from a disappointing 2012 election, where they failed to pick up the White House or win back the Senate, there seem to be two game plans. Some in the GOP have called for a \u201cbigger tent\u201d party that would be more representative and inclusive of the changing demographics of American voters. Others say moderating is the wrong way to go, and that the party needs to stay true to its conservative roots. How this discussion plays out in 2013 and beyond will be fascinating to watch. Opinion: What the tea party cost the GOP Short term, keep your eyes on the Republican National Committee as it completes its comprehensive look at what went right, wrong, and what to fix. \u201cIn order to get back in the game, you\u2019ve got to look at and do a full autopsy of what happened,\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus told CNN about a month ago. We could see some recommendations from the report start to surface in late January, when the party committee holds its annual meeting in Charlotte. 4. Campaign politics: Who says there\u2019s no real action on the campaign trail the year after a presidential election? We\u2019ve always got gubernatorial elections to watch in New Jersey and Virginia the year after the race for the White House. And both should be very interesting this time. Virginia is shaping up to be a battle between Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a tea party-backed and controversial conservative, and Terry McAuliffe, the often outspoken former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The New Jersey race may not be as riveting now that Newark\u2019s Democratic Mayor Corey Booker decided against a bid. But the fact that the Republican candidate is the tough talking popular governor, Chris Christie, means that we\u2019ll have a full year of watching him on the campaign trail and a full year to wonder if his re-election bid is just a warm up act for a 2016 attempt at higher office. Two high-profile governors races ensure 2013 won\u2019t be quiet year But wait, there\u2019s more. Thanks to the president\u2019s nomination of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, it looks like we\u2019ll have a special election in June 2013 to fill the final year and a half of Kerry\u2019s term. And that could give outgoing Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who was just defeated in the November election, a chance to return to the Senate. Meanwhile, three Democratic congressmen are already making moves to run for Kerry\u2019s seat. All the action up in Boston will draw national attention. Markey picks up major support for Senate bid, including from Kerry If that\u2019s not enough, we already have three special elections in 2013 to fill vacant House seats. 5. The race for 2016: Call this the pre pre-season. While it may seem absurd to many people that we are already talking about the next presidential contest when the 2012 election is barely in our rear view mirror, this is the world we live in. So get used to it. Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t even stepped down yet as secretary of state and there\u2019s already constant speculation as to whether she\u2019ll run again for the White House. While no decision from her on any future bid for president is expected in 2013, expect speculation about her future political plans to intensify throughout the new year. Opinion: For 2016, Bush vs. Clinton Same thing, on a lower level, for Vice President Joe Biden. On the Republican side, we\u2019re already starting to look at Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and Christie, through the 2016 prism. In reality, with the real start of the 2016 campaign still about two years away, now\u2019s the time for these possible candidates to make speeches, meet and greet donors, campaign for fellow Republicans in the 2013 and 2014 elections, and write books. And we\u2019ll be here to cover it all.",

            "article_content": "President speaks to NBC for nearly 30 minutes Interview covers subjects like taxes, security at foreign embassies, gun control Obama plans to introduce immigration legislation in next year He thinks Chuck Hagel would be qualified to be next secretary of defense President Barack Obama appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d on Sunday, talking about the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d negotiations and priorities for his administration in his second term. The president told host David Gregory that he was optimistic something will be worked out to keep tax rates from rising on Tuesday \u2013 but if not, his first piece of legislation for the next Congress will be a bill to reduce tax rates on most Americans. Obama slams GOP \u2018priority\u2019 as fiscal cliff hours away The president also spoke about his second term and what he wants to accomplish. Here are highlights of what he said: Obama 'optimistic' for fiscal cliff deal Obamacare: What's next? Obama nomina a Kerry Gun control after the Newtown killings \u201cSomething fundamental in America has to change,\u201d said Obama, who visited on December 16 with families of victims of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings. The president said Sunday he will put forth a proposal next year to change firearm laws. Among the things the legislation will address are assault-style rifles, high-capacity ammunition magazines and background checks on all firearm sales. His comments echoed those made five days after the shootings in Newtown, where a gunman killed his mother at home, then 20 children and six adults at an elementary school. Obama said he hopes that the Newtown killings spur Americans to take action and not let the shootings feel like \u201cone of those routine episodes,\u201d the emotions of which fade with memory. \u201c\u201dIt certainly won\u2019t feel like that to me. This is something that, you know, that was the worst day of my presidency,\u201d he said. The president said he wanted to listen to all the parties involved in the gun control debate but was skeptical about the National Rifle Association\u2019s call to put armed guards in every school as the only solution. Obama said December 19 that a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden will have legislative recommendations in January. Benghazi attack Obama said the security failures that led to the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, were \u201csevere,\u201d but he blamed human mistakes. \u201cThere was just some sloppiness \u2013 not intentional \u2013 in terms of how we secure embassies in areas where you essentially don\u2019t have governments that have a lot of capacity to protect those embassies,\u201d he said. The State Department will implement all of the 29 recommendations by a review board headed by veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering. The FBI also has some \u201cvery good leads\u201d into who carried out the September attack that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others, Obama said. Among the recommendations in the report sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas. \u201cBut we\u2019ll try to do more than that,\u201d Obama said. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice The president said verbal attacks on Rice for her comments on the Benghazi investigation were \u201cpuzzling.\u201d \u201cOf all the people in my national security team, she probably had the least to do with anything that happened in Benghazi,\u201d he said. Rice said on Sunday news programs in the days following the attack that it was the result of a protest against an online anti-Islam film. She was heavily criticized for those statements, to the point that she withdrew her name from consideration as the next secretary of state to avoid what she called a \u201clengthy, disruptive, and costly\u201d confirmation process. Critics said Rice\u2019s comments were out of line with the true intelligence about the incident and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism. \u201cMost Americans recognize that these were largely politically motivated attacks as opposed to being justified,\u201d Obama said. Next secretary of defense He has yet to make a decision as to who to nominate for secretary of defense, Obama said. Sources have said they think the president will pick Chuck Hagel, a Republican, who has met with controversy since his name has been connected with the position. Gay rights groups, which were strong supporters of Obama\u2019s election campaigns, have hit Hagel for questioning in 1998 whether a nominee for an ambassadorship was suitable because he was \u201copenly, aggressively gay.\u201d Obama, without calling Hagel his preferred candidate for the job, said: \u201cI\u2019ve served with Chuck Hagel (in the U.S. Senate). I know him. He is a patriot. He is somebody who has done extraordinary work.\u201d Hagel has apologized for those comments, Obama said. He added that he didn\u2019t see anything in Hagel\u2019s political record that disqualified him as a potential nominee. Hagel currently is the co-chairman of the president\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board. Leon Panetta, who has been secretary of defense since July 2011, has indicated he wants to return to private life next year. Four issues for the next term When asked about his priorities for the next four years, Obama listed immigration, the economy, energy and debt reduction. He will introduce legislation to fix a broken immigration system in 2013, he said. \u201cWe have talked about it long enough,\u201d He said. \u201cWe know how we can fix it.\u201d Obama also wants to fix America\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cIf we are putting people back to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, in part paid for by some of these broader long-term deficit reduction measures that need to take place, that will grow our economy,\u201d he said And he wants to increase further the amount of energy, especially green energy, that America produces. \u201cWe are producing more energy and America can become an energy exporter. (The question is) how do we do that in a way that also deals with the environmental challenges that we also have at the same time,\u201d Obama said. But the most pressing quandary is the fiscal cliff. \u201cIt is going to be very hard for the economy to sustain its current growth trends if suddenly we have a huge bite taken of the average American\u2019s paycheck,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Die-hard conservatives blame Mitt Romney, electoral fraud and liberal conspiracies Few discuss demographic shifts in America Anti-Obama sentiments abound in conservative post-election commentary One blogger proposes an Electoral College boycott Step by step, die-hard conservatives are confronting their grief over President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election. But judging from blog posts and other public pronouncements, many remain stuck somewhere between denial and anger, very far from acceptance. So far this week, prolific blogger Judson Phillips on Tea Party Nation has called for boycotting the Electoral College to prevent validating the election result and lamented the triumph of liberalism in destroying national unity and therefore America\u2019s greatness. Over at RedState.com, a more sophisticated political analysis echoes calls by Republican leaders to better communicate conservative principles instead of softening or dropping them. Founder and CNN contributor Erick Erickson, who rejected any talk of electoral fraud or an unfair Obama victory, wrote Tuesday that \u201cthere\u2019ll be no hand-wringing here and there sure as hell won\u2019t be any apologies for fighting for what we believe in.\u201d \u201cRepublicans are not successful when they run campaigns as the rich patrician out to make government more efficient so it can be more helpful,\u201d said another Erickson post Tuesday. \u201cRepublicans win with conservative populists who run as men who pulled themselves up in life fighting big government and its cronies.\u201d Some acceptance has been necessary. On Tuesday, tea party favorite Rep. Allen West of Florida conceded in his race for re-election after initially alleging electoral fraud. Little of the discussion focuses on the changing demographics of the country, identified by exit polls and many analysts as a major factor in both Obama\u2019s 2008 victory to become the nation\u2019s first African-American president and his re-election on November 6. In particular, Obama received overwhelming support from the nation\u2019s fastest-growing demographic \u2013 Hispanic Americans \u2013 to cause some high-profile conservatives including Fox radio and television host Sean Hannity to soften their stance on immigration reform. Overall, though, hard-core conservatives continue to reject that they are a minority in a country built on the core principle of liberty that they embrace. Instead, the initial reactions and subsequent attempts to explain what happened sought scapegoats, such as what right-wing critics describe as a deficient Republican challenger in Mitt Romney, electoral theft or a liberal-dominated media industry that is part of a broader Marxist effort dating back decades to undermine the nation. Study: Fox, MSNBC got more extreme On November 10, Phillips alleged that more votes than registered voters in several Florida precincts were part of Democratic efforts to \u201csteal the election\u201d against West. There was no immediate posting Tuesday in response to West\u2019s concession. Six days later, Phillips took aim at Romney, calling the former Massachusetts governor a \u201cflip-flopping liberal who ran a content-free campaign.\u201d In a response to Phillips\u2019 post, one writer ranted about what he alleged were \u201cthe sexual perversions and drug use of the Obamas,\u201d the president\u2019s \u201cforged birth certificate\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud of biblical proportions.\u201d \u201cWhy are we talking secession instead of removing the New York Times and supporting citizens\u2019 Grand Jury indicments against this unbelievable treason, felonies and usurpations raining down on us on a daily basis?\u201d said the post attributed to Royce Latham of Penngrove, California. Timothy Stanley: Don\u2019t dismiss secession talk On Sunday, Phillips proposed an action plan \u2013 getting Electoral College voters in states won by Romney to boycott the validation of the election result by the December 17 deadline. \u201cThe 12th Amendment specifies the quorum or the necessary number of states for the College to act, is 2/3,\u201d Phillips wrote. \u201cIn other words, if 17 states refuse to participate, the Electoral College does not have a quorum.\u201d Without a quorum to decide the presidency, he continued, the Republican-led U.S. House will decide and presumably choose Romney. Phillips acknowledged such a move would set a \u201cdangerous precedent,\u201d but added that \u201cthe situation is so grim we really have no other choice.\u201d \u201cDoes anyone really believe America can survive four more years of Barack Obama?\u201d he wrote, saying the president will seek to \u201ctransform America from that shining city on a hill into a third world shantytown, with massive unemployment and a corrupt government.\u201d What\u2019s next for Obama election organization? The next day, Phillips sounded more resigned, lamenting what he called \u201cthe triumph of liberalism in America\u201d that he said was \u201cdestroying our national unity and by extension destroying the freedom.\u201d \u201cIn America, until now we have always identified ourselves as Americans,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe balkanization that has been pushed by the hard left has one goal in mind.  That is the end of America as a great nation. They are perilously close to succeeding.\u201d Tuesday brought his attack on a carbon tax being discussed by some on both sides in Congress as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contributed to climate change. While challenging \u201cthe mythical man-made global warming,\u201d Phillips also said a carbon tax would create a \u201cmassive new tax stream\u201d for liberals bent on growing government. U.N.: Greenhouse gases set record in 2011 The focus on a single issue certain to generate legislative and public debate signaled some change in the response to the election. To Phillips and other conservatives, any increase in revenue goes against their goal of shrinking the federal government by cutting spending. \u201cIt is time for conservative activists to make the case to the American people that we have far more government than we can afford, or than we want, no matter what our politicians may think, or what deals they may be willing to cut with each other to keep spending other people\u2019s money until we are all bankrupt,\u201d said a Tuesday post on Tea Party Nation by Bruce Donnelly of Fox River Grove, Illinois. GOP, Dems seek common ground on fiscal cliff Donnelly called for \u201corganizing voters to rein in the politicians, rather than let them keep playing the game by their rules with our money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worth your effort to organize voters in your community and apply real political pressure for change, because if we just keep playing the game by their rules, your own financial situation will keep getting worse, rather than better,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe politicians keep offering free stuff with other people\u2019s money, playing us all for fools. It\u2019s time to wake up the voters in every corner of America to the fact that they have been conned by these snake oil salesmen and their well-rehearsed lies and false promises,\u201d Donnelly said. In the end, a reviled Democrat in the White House may mean more followers of conservative websites such as Tea Party Nation and RedState.com. No one seems happy about the better business prospects, at least for now.",

Lindsey Graham and John McCain for their \u201coutrageous\u201d comments saying they would block U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice if she is nominated for secretary of state. \u201cIf Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after someone they should go after me,\u201d Obama said at a White House news conference on Wednesday.  \u201cWhen they go after the U.N. ambassador apparently because they think she\u2019s an easy target, then they\u2019ve got a problem with me.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, Graham and McCain said they would use parliamentary means to hold up her nomination, should it be made, over her characterization of the deadly September attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Rice was dispatched to several talk shows, where she said the incident involved a \u201cspontaneous\u201d demonstration. Senior administration officials later said Rice was speaking from talking points prepared for official use and the word \u201cspontaneous\u201d was a poor choice to describe what is now understood to have been a terrorist attack. The assault killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans and was a flashpoint n the just completed presidential election campaign. Transcript: Obama news conference Rice is among the potential nominees to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has said she does not wish to serve in Obama\u2019s second term but is willing to stay on until her replacement is confirmed by the Senate. McCain to Obama: Not picking on anyone McCain, Graham after Susan Rice on Libya McCain took to the floor of the Senate about an hour after Obama\u2019s remarks and said that the president and other statements by officials on the attacks were \u201cnot true.\u201d \u201cThe president of the United States did not tell the American people the truth about the attacks that took four brave Americans\u2019 lives that went on for eight, seven hours, for which we were totally unprepared. Mr. President, four brave Americans died. It has now been eight weeks. The American people have received nothing but contradictory statements from all levels of our government,\u201d he said, pounding his hand on the lectern. Graham: I don't trust Susan Rice McCain charged that \u201cthis president and this administration has either been guilty of colossal incompetence or engaged in a cover up, neither of which are acceptable to the American people.\u201d Graham responded to Obama with a sharp statement of his own: \u201cMr. President, don\u2019t think for one minute I don\u2019t hold you ultimately responsible for Benghazi. I think you failed as commander-in-chief before, during, and after the attack. Live blog: President Obama\u2019s news conference Asked off the Senate floor how personal the exchanges between the senators and Obama got, Graham said, \u201cWell, you know, all I can say is I do hold him responsible.  If he\u2019s worried about me not holding him responsible, he\u2019s wrong.\u201d \u201cI want to work with him on the fiscal cliff.  I want to work with him on immigration. I\u2019d like to work with him on other things that we need to do as a nation but I\u2019m not gonna give him a pass here,\u201d Graham said. Asked if he thought Rice should step down, Graham said, \u201cI\u2019m not asking her to step down.  I\u2019m just not going to promote anybody that I think is up to their eyeballs in the debacle.\u201d Graham: I don't trust Susan Rice The scandal's impact on the military In his remarks on Wednesday, Obama defended Rice\u2019s earlier televised comments, saying \u201cshe made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her.\u201d He said he is open to the appointment for Rice, although he said has not yet decided who he will advance when Clinton steps down. Speculation has also centered on U.S. Sen. John Kerry for secretary of state or defense. Rice previously served as assistant secretary of state under former President Bill Clinton and was a foreign policy adviser to Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. Graham and other Republicans have not only questioned her statements, but also why the administration put her forward, rather than another top official who might have been more directly connected to the Libya situation. \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t trust her is that I think she knew better, and if she didn\u2019t\u2019 know better, she shouldn\u2019t be the voice of America,\u201d Graham said. Obama\u2019s opening bid on taxes Both Graham and McCain have called for a select committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks, including the U.S. response and preparations, such as whether the consulate had adequate security. \u201cI just want to find out what happened in Benghazi in a coordinated fashion that the work product would be accepted by the American people,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI\u2019ve got some firm opinions.  I think it was poorly handled.  But we\u2019ll never know.  I think it\u2019s a symptom of a greater problem.\u201d He reiterated his call for one committee to investigate. \u201cInstead of going off in three different directions, where you don\u2019t coordinate your questions, and having people testify multiple times, let\u2019s put one committee together. Democrats will lead it. They should, they\u2019re in charge.  And find out what happened. \u201cI\u2019m dying to know \u2013 Mr. President, I\u2019ve got a simple question: Did you know the consulate was attacked in June?  And if you do know it was attacked in June, why didn\u2019t you do something about protecting it?\u201d But Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who has joined forces with Graham and McCain in calling for a select committee investigation of Benghazi, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that she would put a hold on any Rice nomination until she answered questions. \u201cThen then I will reassess what her answers are on those questions,\u201d Ayotte said. \u201cI have serious concerns about where we are right now and trusting what she has to say, but I\u2019m willing to listen to what she has to say,\u201d Ayotte added. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d that someone should lose their jobs over Benghazi but Rice should not be the issue. He said security questions are paramount. \u201cI think really the more important question isn\u2019t really about whether it was caused by terrorism or whether it was caused by a movie,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it was terrorism, but I think the more important question is why were there no Marines guarding our ambassador. Who made the decision \u2013 not an immediate\u2026 decision, but a month-long desk decision to send an ambassador into a war-torn country without any uniformed Marines.\u201d Paul said he did not want to \u201cpre-judge\u201d any nomination for the secretary of state.

            "article_content": "Democrats cheer gains of women, but experts say power is not yet among them There are few women in either party who hold key roles on powerful House committees True test will be increase in leadership roles, sponsoring legislation, political experts say When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced that she would seek to keep her leadership role she stood flanked by a cheering phalanx of her female colleagues. Pelosi, who prior to the Democratic Party\u2019s loss of the House in 2010 served as its first female speaker, sandwiched her announcement between pointed comments about the Democratic agenda and how she sees her party\u2019s policies as helpful to women. Pelosi said she would vie to keep her leadership role \u201cin order to continue work on empowering women.\u201d But as even Democrats exult an election which saw, for the first time in history, women and minorities net the majority of House seats on their side of the aisle and a record 16 Democratic seats in the Senate, political experts warn against premature celebration. Pelosi to run again for Democratic leader An increase in the number of women does not automatically translate into increased political power. Democrats may have been able to woo female voters and throw tremendous support behind getting women elected to office, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that is how they govern,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. \u201cMoving forward in the direction that will improve women\u2019s social, economic and political autonomy takes time,\u201d she said \u2013 time and the type of power that House Democrats currently lack. Murray: Diversity is better for nation Minorities, women helped Obama win Boehner: GOP has 'some work to do' New U.S. House: Women and minorities to the left; white men to the right Democrats are the minority in the House and do not have control of that chamber\u2019s most powerful committees. That means they have far less control over the types of legislation that comes out of those committees. And even within the Democratic House caucus, women are far outnumbered and outranked on some of the most powerful committees. \u201cThe most traditional measure (of political power) would be leadership positions, not just ranking positions on key committees but any membership on these committees,\u201d Lawless said. There is only one Democratic woman, Rep. Shelley Berkley of Nevada, on the powerful House Ways and Means committee, which oversees tax writing, revenue and entitlement programs. There are other male lawmakers ahead of her with seniority to serve as ranking member. The ranking Democrats on the Appropriations, Budget, Education and the Workforce and Energy and Commerce committees are also all men. New York Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, one of the longest-serving women in Congress, is the ranking member on the House Rules Committee. While the Senate has a greater share of women in leadership positions, there are no Republican women in top leadership roles. There are also other questions of whether women indeed have an equal place at the political table, Lawless said. Lawless added that there are questions, like who is sponsoring significant pieces of legislation? Who are the most outspoken members regarding women\u2019s issues? Are women leading the discussions on the fiscal cliff? With their big political win, the new American electorate has arrived Those questions will perhaps best be answered when the new Congress convenes in January. However, with such dramatic demographic and ideological differences in the House \u2014 women and minorities make up the majority on the left, white men are the majority on the right \u2014 Congress is likely headed for more partisan gridlock, said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report. For example, \u201cIt will be more difficult to pass a bill to address the debt,\u201d he said. The two parties and their newly remade majorities also will likely be at loggerheads on such issues as entitlement spending, immigration and health care reform, political experts say. In the upcoming policy debates, the Republican side of the aisle will find it tougher to utilize their dwindled female corps to reach out to their Democratic compatriots, political experts say. \u201cFor Republican women it was a bad night,\u201d Michele Swers, a Georgetown University professor of American government, said of Election Night. In the House, a number of Republican women lost races including Saratoga Springs, Utah, Mayor Mia Love, a Mormon of Haitian descent and rising Republican Party star who was given a high-profile speaking role at the Republican National Convention in August. Others, such as tea party favorite and former presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota narrowly kept their seats. The majority of the Republican-held House seats are occupied by white men. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington, the GOP\u2019s top woman in the House, was elected Republican Conference Chairman on Wednesday, despite the fact that Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, threw his support behind Rep. Tom Price of Georgia. \u201cThey\u2019re somewhat limited,\u201d Lawless said of the GOP leadership\u2019s ability to put forth women on key issues. \u201cOnly 10% of the Republican Congress is women. To the extent they want to be inclusive, it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s dozens and dozens of women who can speak for them. The lack of numbers hurts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama expects immigration bill to be introduced after inauguration Obama offered fierce defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice over Benghazi comments Obama said unaware of any disclosure from Petraeus scandal that could harm national security President opened door to compromise regarding the impending fiscal cliff President Barack Obama said Wednesday he was unaware of any disclosure of classified information from the scandal engulfing former CIA Director David Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, that could damage national security. \u201cI have no evidence at this point from what I\u2019ve seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,\u201d Obama said in his first post-election news conference. Obama, addressing the ongoing controversy for the first time publicly, said Petraeus tendered his resignation because his actions \u201cdid not meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the CIA.\u201d The former four-star general admitted last Friday that he had had an extramarital affair with a woman who was later identified as a co-author of his biography. Obama: Fiscal cliff a 'solvable' problem Obama: 'Outrageous' to sully Rice's name McCain, Graham after Susan Rice on Libya The FBI is also investigating Allen over his contacts with another woman whose complaints about anonymous, harassing e-mails led to the discovery of the Petraeus affair. When asked if he should have known about the investigation into his former CIA chief earlier, the president said he is \u201cwithholding judgment\u201d because all of the information is not yet available. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait and see \u2026 how this whole process unfolded,\u201d Obama added. The scandal has threatened to complicate Obama\u2019s focus on critical negotiations with Congress over spending cuts and taxes. It has also raised questions surrounding the CIA\u2019s response to congressional inquiries into the September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. On that matter, Obama offered a fierce defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who has come under scrutiny for public comments in the days following the attack in which she placed blame for it on a mob enraged by an anti-Muslim video. The president said Rice was speaking with the information provided by the intelligence community and has acted with \u201cskill, professionalism, toughness and grace.\u201d In response to statements Wednesday from Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said they would block a potential Rice nomination for a Cabinet position, Obama said if the lawmakers want to \u201cgo after somebody, they should go after me. I\u2019m happy to have that discussion with them.\u201d \u201cFor them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and besmirch her reputation is outrageous,\u201d he said. On another pressing foreign policy issue, Obama said he was not ready to arm the Syrian opposition movement, saying that the nation needed to avoid indirectly providing weapons to groups or people who would seek to harm Americans or Israelis. The United States is supporting a new coalition of Syrian dissidents and is seeking to accelerate assistance in their effort to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to leave office. On budget matters at home, Obama opened the door to compromise regarding the impending fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts. The president said he was encouraged by recent comments from members of the Republican Party surrounding the need for more revenue from the wealthiest Americans as part of a plan to reduce the deficit. \u201cBoth parties voted to set this deadline, and I believe both parties can make these decisions together \u2026 in a balanced and responsible way,\u201d Obama said. Obama stood by his previous statements about tax rates. He called on House Republicans to agree to Senate-passed proposals that would extend current tax rates for those making $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher levels for those making over that amount and insisted he would not accept a lower tax rate for the wealthiest 2% of Americans. His comments should not come as a surprise, he said, given his statements during the election. \u201cI\u2019ve got one mandate to help middle class families and families working hard to get into the middle class,\u201d Obama said. He specifically referenced a letter he received from a man in Tennessee who said he did not vote for Obama. The voter said he was watching Obama\u2019s comments recently on CNN about the fiscal cliff and said his hope \u201cis that we can make progress in light of personal and party principles, special interest groups, and years of business as usual. We\u2019ve got to work together and put our differences aside.\u201d After reading from the letter, Obama added: \u201cI couldn\u2019t say it better myself. That\u2019s precisely what I intend to do.\u201d The president is often criticized for not forging relationships with Congress, to the detriment of his agenda. On Wednesday he acknowledged that history and said he can \u201calways do better.\u201d His relationships haven\u2019t \u201calways manifested itself in the kind of agreement I\u2019d like to see between Democrats and Republicans,\u201d he said. Obama is set meet with major CEOs following his news conference, some of whom flexed their political muscle to defeat Democrats in elections last week. He is expected to find backing for some of the administration\u2019s positions ahead of negotiations with Congress on avoiding the fiscal cliff. Leaders of the largest companies have indicated they are holding back hiring and spending because they are worried about Washington gridlock over the fiscal cliff. The president sat down Tuesday with labor leaders and the heads of six independent groups involved in organizing grassroots support for progressive causes and told them that he intended to allow the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans while preserving them for middle-income earners, according to several people at that meeting. \u201cThe president was very strong on saying there\u2019s going to be an end to the Bush tax cuts one way or another,\u201d said one participant who requested anonymity to discuss the off-the-record meeting. Obama is to meet with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the White House on Friday. The president took on two other issues that he has said he will address during his second term: immigration and climate change. An increase in the Hispanic vote that helped him win battleground states, created an opening, Obama said, to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something he and members of Congress failed to pass during his first term. He expects a bill to be introduced soon after his inauguration in January, adding an agreement should address border security and pathways to citizenship for thousands of illegal immigrants if they go to college or serve in the military. Obama also reaffirmed his belief that \u201cclimate change is real\u201d and is \u201cimpacted by human behavior and carbon emissions.\u201d He said it could be tackled if members of both political parties are prepared to make some \u201ctough political\u201d decisions. The last time Obama held a full-blown news conference at the White House, his first campaign rally was two months away and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum looked to have the upper hand over Mitt Romney in the GOP presidential primaries. To be sure, in some ways the political landscape has changed dramatically since Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on March 6:  He is now assured of four more years in the Oval Office and can claim fresh leverage in his dealings with Republicans over reaching a budget deal. But in many ways, the political environment closely mirrors what it looked like eight months ago: Republicans remain in control of the House of Representatives, the GOP leadership maintains it is opposed to any measure that will raise tax rates on the nation\u2019s top earners and the president\u2019s approval rating remains stubbornly stuck around a less-than impressive 50%. Moreover, with election-year politics having largely rendered Congress unproductive over the past year, many of the same issues remain at the forefront as they did the last time the president held a formal news conference \u2013 namely the ballooning national debt, the tepid economic recovery, unrest in the Middle East and the specter of a nuclear Iran. To be fair, Obama has taken the national media\u2019s questions in other forums since his March news conference, most recently in late August when he made an unannounced stop at the regular White House briefing in the midst of the heated campaign and a week before the start of the Republican National Convention. But he only took four questions that day and the entire session lasted less than 30 minutes. Moreover, the president ran for re-election while largely ignoring White House reporters in favor of local outlets and entertainment shows. Pressed on why he wasn\u2019t taking more questions from national media outlets, Obama campaign aides said the president could reach more battleground voters via local news than through network television programs or national publications. Fiscal cliff headache for middle class Those interviews were largely filled with predictable softball questions, though it should be noted that one Colorado news anchor drew wide praise for aggressively questioning the president over conflicting White House accounts in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The president also showed a preference for more light-hearted forms of media during the course of the campaign, granting interviews with comedians Jon Stewart and Jay Leno, daytime talk show \u201cThe View,\u201d and MTV\u2019s Sway Calloway. Again, Obama aides stressed the president was likely to reach more undecided voters through these programs than traditional news shows. But critics, including some who are part of the very press corps Obama appeared to be ignoring, questioned whether the president was attempting to dodge more hard-edged questions. Indeed, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked last week if the president\u2019s more or less avoidance of the White House press corps over the last eight months showed a \u201ccertain amount of disdain\u201d for them. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Carney replied. \u201cAbsolutely not. The president was out there campaigning for re-election and giving interviews daily to reporters \u2026 from news organizations across the country, from regional newspapers and television stations, and answered a lot of tough questions.\u201d Poll: Public concern over effects of the \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 Alex Mooney and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Women and minorities now make up majority of Democratic caucus in the House After election, House Republican caucus is more white and more male Differences could lead to showdowns and gridlock over immigration, health care and the debt When the incoming U.S. House freshmen of the 113th Congress take their class photo, the image will reflect two very different visions of the nation. On the Democratic side: Women and minorities \u2013 a coalition that, along with young voters, largely helped re-elect President Barack Obama \u2013 collectively will for the first time in the nation\u2019s history outnumber white male Democrats. On the Republican side: The majority of the House seats will be held by white men \u2013 a group which far outnumbers the now dwindled numbers of House GOP women and minorities after the losses of two minority members and about a half dozen women from that caucus. \u201cThey say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Well the picture that you see before you is worth millions of votes, millions of aspirations and dreams of the American people for problem-solvers to come to Washington to get to the job done, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in welcoming the incoming freshman class to the Capitol for orientation. Murray: Dems have to 'stand firm' Boehner: GOP has 'some work to do' Congress, get to work! Minorities, women helped Obama win Pelosi\u2019s guessing game \u201cToday we officially welcome our Democratic freshmen to Washington. They are extraordinary leaders who will make our House Democratic caucus the first caucus in history, in the history of civilized government, to have a majority of women and minorities in the caucus.\u201d It also symbolizes something else that is more troubling politically. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a sign that both parties are distilling to their core, and they are living in parallel universes,\u201d said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report. The stark demographic and ideological differences now reflected in the House will also likely lead to increased partisan showdowns over entitlement spending, education, health care and immigration reform, political and cultural experts say.  Studies and polls have shown, for example, that women tend to be more supportive of government spending than men, and those attitudes might have helped influence women\u2019s choice for president, said Michele Swers, a Georgetown University American government professor. \u201cYou can draw a clear line between the changing demographics of the parties and the polarization (likely to follow),\u201d Wasserman said. The shift is the result of an increase in the Hispanic population and concerted efforts among the Democratic leadership to recruit and support female and minority candidates coupled with the effect of redistricting, which created large majority minority districts in states such as California, Florida and Texas. 2014 battle for the Senate starts now Democrats picked up three seats in the election so far and lead in five others yet to be resolved. A sixth race will be decided in a runoff between two Republicans. In the heavily contested race to win the newly created 9th Congressional District seat in Arizona, TV ad dollars from a Democratic super PAC helped Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, a former state senator, defeat Republican Vernon Parker, the former mayor of Paradise Valley. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019re seeing a record number of Democratic women elected to office,\u201d said Jess McIntosh, a spokeswoman with Emily\u2019s List, an organization that works to help pro-choice, Democratic women get elected to office, on Election Night. Her group supported Sinema. \u201cIt says voters saw a clear contrast between the parties \u2026 there was an absolute rejection of extremist Republican (proposals).\u201d Though there has been an increase in women elected to federal office, there is still room for progress, Jennifer Lawless, director of Women & Politics Institute at American University, said. \u201cObviously this is movement in the right direction,\u201d Lawless said, adding women are still underrepresented in federal offices. \u201cWomen are 50% of population, so I\u2019m not sure we should be breaking our arms patting ourselves on the back,\u201d Lawless said. And with those redrawn districts comes increased polarization. Moderate Senate Democrats eye midterms warily \u201cWhat Republicans (in state legislatures) did in redistricting was purge a lot of blacks and Latinos out of their congressional districts,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cNon-white voters are sufficient to win those seats.\u201d Losses among moderate, white, male \u201cblue dog\u201d Democrats and Republican women and minorities further helped change the face of Congress, Wasserman said. House Republicans lost one African-American, one Latino and a net of six women, he said. House Republicans lost one of their few African-American members when Florida Rep. Allen West appeared to have been defeated by Democratic businessman Patrick Murphy, although West refuses to concede and demands a recount. Blue dog Democrats Leonard Boswell of Iowa, Ben Chandler of Kentucky and Larry Kissell of North Carolina all lost their races. The House\u2019s congressional makeover occurs as a battle looms over immigration reform, which could not only test the new-found political sway of minorities but also the Republican Party\u2019s ability to redirect on the issue, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cStrategically, Obama needs to identify pro-immigration Republicans and get them on board pretty quickly. He\u2019s got to figure out which Republicans are hip and realize the game has got to change on immigration and help protect them (so) they feel comfortable enough to defect,\u201d Gillespie said. Republican leaders know that there are challenges ahead. Many issues same since Obama\u2019s last news conference \u201cIt\u2019s clear that as a political party, we\u2019ve got some work to do,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner told reporters after the election. \u201cThe principles of our party are sound,\u201d but the question is, \u201chow we talk about who we are as a party?\u201d But politically, Republicans, who hold control of the House, have little incentive to compromise, Wasserman said. \u201cA lot of people who anticipated Republicans would lick their wounds \u2026 there\u2019s no incentive for House Republicans to fold,\u201d he said. For now, at least. Republicans \u201ccan\u2019t continue to write off demographics,\u201d Lawless told CNN. Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters \u2013 who, according to U.S. Census figures released earlier this year, now represent more than half of the nation\u2019s population born in the past year \u2013 will become more of a power base in traditional Republican strongholds such as Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend across the Southwest all the way to California, experts say. When that happens, Congress could see the type of political alliances that are now considered rare. \u201cWe\u2019re a country that has always presumed male leadership, has always been most comfortable with white male leadership and we\u2019re watching the transition of that notion,\u201d said Mark Anthony Neal, a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University.

            "article_content": "The president has first scheduled White House news conference in eight months on Wednesday Will Obama interpret the election results as a mandate going into second term? Obama has said he thinks he can tackle immigration reform. How will he lead on the issue? How will president address foreign policy team immersed in turmoil? President Barack Obama is scheduled to have his first news conference since March on Wednesday. It will be the 16th of his presidency and the first since his reelection last week. CNN\u2019s daily Gut Check asked those that cover Washington for what they\u2019ll be watching for. Here are five things: 1. Does Obama see a mandate? Post-election news conferences always have an air of history to them as they set the initial tone for the next two to four years of an administration. Who could forget Obama\u2019s dubbing 2010 a \u201cshellacking\u201d after Democrats were crushed in the midterms, or the newly re-elected George W. Bush on Nov. 4, 2004, smirking at cameras as he declared, \u201cI pledged to reach out to the whole nation. And today, I\u2019m proving that I\u2019m willing to reach out to everybody by including the White House press corps.\u201d Will Obama himself claim a mandate as he pushes Congress to deal? And if he does, will he say, \u201cThe American people are with me on this,\u201d or will he be specific as to his interpretation of why he feels he earned the majority of America\u2019s votes? Many issues same since Obama\u2019s last news conference 2. Standing by his man With the scandal involving former CIA Director David Petraeus heating up just as the Afghanistan war enters a crucial phase, CNN\u2019s chief political analyst Gloria Borger tells Gut Check, \u201cThe president\u2019s vote of confidence in Gen. (John) Allen\u201d will have her eye tomorrow. Will Obama stand by his top commander unequivocally? The Petraeus scandal: What we know Obama meets labor leaders Obama 'surprised' by Petraeus scandal Norquist: Tax cuts should be extended 3. New second-term relationships Senior Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash asks, \u201cWill the president do in his second term what Republicans as well as Democrats on Capitol Hill complain he didn\u2019t do in his first \u2013 reach out? \u201cHe told Jessica Yellin in her documentary that he doesn\u2019t have time to socialize because he has two young daughters. But he\u2019s got to eat lunch, right? Have coffee in the morning? Will he vow to make more of an effort to get to know lawmakers in his second term? By all accounts \u2013 especially from Democratic lawmakers \u2013 not doing that hurt him in his first term. Maybe he\u2019ll make more time over the next four years.\u201d Obama demands fast action on fiscal cliff 4. Taking the lead on immigration CNN\u2019s White House Producer Lesa Jansen writes, \u201cI want to hear from the president on his strategy for passing bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cAfter winning back the White House with an astounding 71% of the Latino vote, can the president lay out a plan to tackle the immigration issue? Republicans are apparently ready to sign on but House Speaker John Boehner recently said it is the president who must lead. Appearing on the Spanish-language television network Univision before the election, Obama said the \u2018greatest failure\u2019 of his presidency was not being able to pass immigration reform. Will this issue help to shape the Obama legacy?\u201d Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform 5. National insecurity CNN\u2019s Security Clearance Blog Editor Adam Levine tells us, \u201cI want to hear how convincing the president is about his foreign policy and national security being on terra firma given the abrupt departure of Petraeus, the investigation of the top commander in Afghanistan who is in the middle of planning the U.S. endgame in the war and the expected departure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \u201cWhile second-term departures of top officials are expected, the abrupt developments of this past week impact people at the helm of some of the sensitive foreign policy issues facing the nation. It also comes as his administration is marching up to the Hill to brief Congress on what happened in Libya. The scandals will pass but can Obama convince the nation his White House is not embroiled and distracted?\u201d Analysis: Will national security scandal create national security risk?",

Instead Boehner pointed to getting rid of some corporate and personal tax loopholes and eliminating some deductions that would bring in new money to the treasury. \u201cIf we clean up the code, make it simpler, the tax code will be more efficient. The current code only collects about 85% of what\u2019s due the government and it\u2019s clear that if you have a simpler, cleaner, fairer tax code that efficiency, the effectiveness and efficiency of the tax code increases exponentially.\u201d Pressed for specifics, Boehner repeatedly wouldn\u2019t give any, stressing he didn\u2019t want to limit any options available to him or the White House. Obama, Boehner begin year-end duel over fiscal cliff The speaker argued reforms to entitlement programs, which he said were major contributors to the exploding deficit, must be part of any final deal. \u201cThis is year two of a 25-year demographic bubble that \u2013 wasn\u2019t like anyone couldn\u2019t see it coming. 10,000 baby boomers, like me, retiring every day; 70,000 a week. It\u2019s 3.5 million this year and this is just the second year of the 25-year baby boom bubble and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s money in Social Security or Medicare. This has to be dealt with.\u201d But congressional Democrats continue to maintain that any changes to these programs should come only from reductions to providers, not any changes to benefits \u2013 an issue that is likely to be thorny as the talks move from the stage of both sides saying they want a deal to actually discussing the nitty gritty. CNNMoney: What is the fiscal cliff? The speaker seemed to brush off the notion that he would have a tough time getting fellow House Republicans to sign on to whatever agreement he discussed with the White House. \u201cWhen the president and I have been able to come to agreement, there\u2019s been no problem getting it passed here in the House,\u201d Boehner said flatly. GOP struggling for answers amid disarray A senior aide to a top House conservative who hasn\u2019t always agreed with Boehner told CNN, \u201cFor the most part, you\u2019re going to see people give the speaker a chance to see what he can do.\u201d \u201cWe all understand the president won re-election, we won re-election, we\u2019re in an interesting position and we\u2019ll have to figure out the best way to get through all this,\u201d this aide said, but noted that Boehner is continuing to stick with the GOP position that revenue only comes from growth from tax reform. Got questions about the fiscal cliff? We\u2019ll get the answers Another senior House Republican aide said that top GOP leaders were reaching out informally to rank-and-file members to take their temperature. Congress returns next week for its lame-duck session and faces enormous pressure to come up with a deal to avert the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d \u2013 the combination of the Bush-era tax cuts that are expiring at the end of the year and the across-the-board automatic spending cuts that are due to kick in starting in January. Boehner restated his stance that he thinks only a temporary \u2013 one-year \u2013 agreement should be discussed during the lame-duck Congress, but the broader so-called \u201cgrand bargain\u201d deal would need to wait until the next Congress. Obama demands fast action on fiscal cliff, including tax hike on wealthy \u201c2013 should be the year we begin to solve our debt through tax reform and entitlement reform,\u201d Boehner said. While the president beat GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney handily on Tuesday night and Democrats picked up seats in both the Senate and the House, Boehner asserted his own power in the negotiations. \u201cThe American people re-elected a Republican majority, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that our team, in a very difficult year, was able to maintain our majority.\u201d But the Ohio Republican conceded, \u201cAs a political party, we\u2019ve got some work to do.\u201d After Romney lost by a huge margin among Hispanic voters, Boehner shifted his stance on immigration, saying in an interview with ABC on Thursday night that he was \u201cconfident\u201d both sides could agree to a comprehensive immigration reform proposal. But he appeared to walk back how broad of a proposal he could back on Friday saying, \u201d I\u2019m not talking about a 3,000-page bill, what I\u2019m talking about a common-sense, step-by-step approach that would secure our borders, allow us to enforce the laws and fix a broken immigration system. But again on an issue this big, the president has to lead.\u201d When pressed if he was now supporting a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers, Boehner declined to answer.",

            "article_content": "Election shows country less conservative than popular belief suggests, some analysts say Others say it means the country is even more \"racially polarized\" than people believed Results marked a series of cultural firsts on race, same-sex marriage, marijuana, gender \"The '60s culture wars won, and that's a legacy we're seeing,\" Julian Zelizer said. America woke up Wednesday, looked into a giant mirror made up of millions of votes and saw how it has been changing for decades. It wasn\u2019t just President Obama\u2019s re-election and the diverse coalition of minorities, women and youth that kept him in power. For the first time, voters approved same-sex marriage in three states. Margaret Hoover, a Republican analyst and CNN contributor, called it \u201ca watershed moment.\u201d Meanwhile, Wisconsin elected the country\u2019s first openly gay U.S. senator. Two states legalized the recreational use of marijuana. A record 20 women will be serving in the U.S. Senate. And a record number of new Asian-American and Latino representatives were elected to Congress. 2 men, 2 speeches, 1 unifying message Obama's second term agenda Taking stock of tea party after election Minorities, women helped Obama win All this would have been unthinkable a generation ago, as would the idea the country would elect, let alone re-elect, its first black president. Tuesday\u2019s election showed that the United States is redefining what it means to be an American, some political and social observers say: The country is less conservative than popular belief suggests. It\u2019s no longer the same America. The nation has arrived at a \u201cnew normal.\u201d Others say the election showed that America is \u201cfractured\u201d and even more \u201cracially polarized\u201d than many people believed, while some analysts caution against reading too much into any one election. Americans may have awakened Wednesday to the same balance of power in Washington \u2013 same president, same divided Congress \u2013 but in many ways they also woke up to the sense that things outside the Beltway might never be quite the same. James Carville: GOP routed by reality The America that gave the president a second term and ushered in a string of cultural firsts was formed at a time of dramatic changes that were starting to take root just around the time Obama was born in 1961. \u201cThe \u201960s culture wars won, and that\u2019s a legacy that we\u2019re now seeing,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, political historian at Princeton University and CNN contributor. \u201cDoing away with taboos\u201d \u2013 about race, sexuality, drugs and gender roles \u2013 accompanied a rejection of government control over sex and drugs, particularly marijuana, he said. \u201cMost of America, even in the red states, moved in a more liberal direction, even in areas where they\u2019re conservative on taxes and government spending.\u201d Now, more and more children of the \u201960s have kids of their own who are not only old enough to vote but who are politically active, reaching out to other new voters and reshaping the political spectrum, he said. So the same growing population that wants government to stay out of same-sex relationships, marijuana use and contraception also wants a racially inclusive government, analysts said. That\u2019s where Democrats have succeeded and Republicans lag far behind. It\u2019s a reality Republican analyst Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, described as he was absorbing the \u201cbeating\u201d the GOP took Tuesday. There is \u201ckind of a 1950s America that we lost,\u201d Castellanos said. \u201cIt\u2019s an old way of looking at the world.\u201d With their big political win, the new American electorate has arrived Inclusiveness vs. polarization The blaring political lesson of Election 2012 wasn\u2019t lost on either side.  Winning among white men was once the key to victory.  Now, relying on them is the key to failure. But what it tells the country about itself is more complicated. \u201cIncreasing numbers of Americans are moving toward a much more inclusive sense of what an American is,\u201d said Clara Rodriguez, professor of sociology at Fordham University in New York. \u201cThe earlier definition of an American, which was so prevalent in our media of the 1940s, \u201950s, \u201860s and to a certain extent the \u201870s, has given way to a definition that reflects the great diversity of America today. \u201cThe president, and his fabulous family and relationship with his wife and children \u2013 those are also examples of inclusiveness.\u201d It\u2019s a way of thinking that\u2019s permeating society, she says.  After 20 years as a professor, Rodriguez is now seeing college students more interested in each other\u2019s ethnic backgrounds than ever. \u201cStudents feel that they have something to learn from each other,\u201d she said. Democrats have succeeded at demonstrating that inclusiveness, analysts said. CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria says the election highlighted the \u201cembrace of diversity \u2013 in every sense,\u201d which \u201cis America\u2019s great gift to the world.\u201d In a column for the Washington Post, he wrote, \u201cWhat the world saw this week was a picture of America at its best: edgy, experimental, open-minded \u2013 and brilliantly diverse.\u201d Writer David Simon, a former journalist and well-known TV producer, didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cThe country is changing,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201cAmerica will soon belong to the men and women \u2026 who can comfortably walk into a room and accept with real comfort the sensation that \u2026 there are no real majorities, only pluralities and coalitions. \u201cThose who relied on entitlement and division to command power will either be obliged to accept the changes, or retreat to the gated communities from which they wish to wax nostalgic and brood on political irrelevance.\u201d Opinion: How GOP can attract Latino voters The 2010 Census confirmed what many had predicted: that the country has reached a turning point in its makeup. Fewer than half the babies being born in the United States are now identified as white, while more than one in three Americans identified as minorities, a figure that grew from 87 million to 112 million over 10 years. Much of the change accompanied Hispanic immigration, which \u201chas profoundly changed the way the country votes, the way it sounds, the way it looks,\u201d Zelizer said. And that brings all sorts of political changes.  A key one, according to exit polls: By far, the majority of Tuesday\u2019s voters support offering illegal immigrants legal status, a belief in line with the Democratic Party. But not everyone sees all this inclusiveness as proof that the pot is melting. \u201cThis election shows me that America is even more racially polarized than we thought previously,\u201d said Kris Marsh, professor of race and ethnicity at the University of Maryland. The predictions that Obama would get minority and youth votes and Romney would get white and elderly votes bore out, she notes \u2013 showing the fissure, loud and clear. Now, Marsh fears that voices on the Republican side will \u201cblame blacks, Latinos and the young\u201d for any ills that may befall America over the next four years. And on the flip side, Marsh says, many on the left harbor unfair views of the right, painting it as a caricature of racists who \u201chate blacks, Latinos, immigrants, the poor and gays.\u201d The two sides, she argues, are as entrenched as ever. Ken Walsh, writer for U.S. News & World Report, also says the election highlighted the nation\u2019s differences. \u201cIt revealed in vivid detail how Balkanized the United States has become, and how difficult it will be to achieve compromise in Washington,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe upshot of all this is that we are living in a fractured nation. It will be up to Obama as president to unite us to achieve common goals. But it\u2019s unclear whether he can do so since he has the support of only half the country.\u201d Van Jones, a Democratic consultant and CNN contributor, says the election itself proves that the president is already bringing disparate constituencies together. \u201cNobody believed four years ago \u2026 you could have black folks and lesbians and gays and Latinos and young folks standing together and trying to move the country forward,\u201d he said. Opinion: GOP voter suppression fueled black turnout Questioning a conservative America The success of what some are calling the new Democratic \u201ccoalition\u201d slammed the brakes on an oft-repeated adage of the political right: that far more Americans identify as \u201cconservative\u201d than \u201cliberal.\u201d It\u2019s an assertion that was backed up by a Gallup poll in January.  But now, some prominent voices on the right are questioning it. \u201cWe have always said it\u2019s a center-right country. And I\u2019ve always believed it,\u201d Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity said after the election results came in.  \u201cTonight, I will be honest, I am not so sure.\u201d Analysts say that taking on the question of whether America leans right or left means wading into murky waters. \u201cI think Americans are schizophrenic when it comes to conservatism and liberalism,\u201d Zelizer said.  \u201cThey often say, \u2018I like less government.\u2019  But when you ask about any specifics, they start to say, \u2018We like the government doing that.\u2019 \u201c Being more inclusive does not automatically mean being more liberal, said Rodriguez, of Fordham. \u201cWhen Dick Cheney announced his daughter was gay and affirmed his acceptance of her, that was a pivotal turning point because it affirmed other people to do the same,\u201d she said. But taking that stance certainly didn\u2019t make Cheney \u201cmore liberal in the traditional sense of the word,\u201d Rodriguez said. Traditional meanings of those words may no longer apply, says Joel Kotkin, professor at Chapman University in Orange, California. \u201cIn some sense, meanings are now flipped,\u201d he said. Many liberals want to preserve the status quo, including large institutions such as universities, governments and nonprofits, he said, while some conservatives favor radical changes, such as how schools are run. The election did show \u201cthere is no longer one America \u2013 maybe there never was \u2013 but at least two,\u201d he said: a dominant, \u201cprogressive\u201d one \u201cthat supports government spending, higher taxes, green politics and social liberalism\u201d and a \u201cslightly smaller one\u201d favoring \u201clower taxes, less regulation, resource development and a somewhat more traditional view of \u2018family.\u2019 \u201c The smaller, traditional group is growing, but mainly by having more children, he said. But it will take them a generation \u201cto catch up with the swelling numbers of singles and the growth of minorities.\u201d \u201cWhat has not found consciousness or expression,\u201d he said, \u201cis a third way of looking at America\u201d in which the different constituencies may find common ground and coalesce. Seven way religious diversity played in the election Reading too much into one election? The adage of President Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, \u201cIt\u2019s the Economy, Stupid,\u201d may not be getting enough focus in all the talk about what this election meant, some analysts say. Yes, Obama succeeded amid an economy that would generally give an incumbent a tough ride. But Mitt Romney, a multi-millionaire who grew up in a wealthy, powerful family, may not have been the right man to take advantage of that opportunity, especially with the memory of the Great Recession still haunting the country. \u201cA sizable portion of the population that is poor may be conservative, but they are unlikely to support political candidates who appear out of touch with the working class,\u201d said Stephanie Ann Bohon, sociology professor at the University of Tennessee. \u201cMany, many Americans are resentful of the wealthy right now, and they are unlikely to fully embrace a candidate who seems dedicated to keeping the wealthy happy.\u201d Bohon said Tuesday\u2019s election didn\u2019t signal a major shift in political views or public opinion as much as simply a change in demographics. \u201cThe proportion of the voting eligible population grew for Latinos, blacks and Asians, and it did not grow nearly as much for whites.\u201d After 2008, some conservative pundits had expected minority voting to drop back to \u201cnormal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is a new normal.\u201d Bohon is not alone in warning not to read too much into the tea leaves of this one election. The right did have a few successes.  Conservatives limited \u201cObamacare\u201d in several states and shut down some marijuana initiatives.  The GOP also expanded its majority in governors\u2019 mansions, including taking back North Carolina for the first time in two decades. Marsh, of the University of Maryland, fears the consequences of suggesting that the country has become \u201ccolorblind\u201d or \u201cpost-racial.\u201d \u201cThat is dangerous territory,\u201d she said. Racial and gender inequalities persist and must be dealt with.  The traditional white male establishment in America is in no danger \u201cof losing its power,\u201d she argued. Still, analysts say Election 2012 signaled a sea change. There was an era in U.S. political life \u201cthat began with Ronald Reagan, where there was a conservative dominance powered by conservative voters and Southern whites,\u201d said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.  \u201cThat era is over.\u201d Join the discussion on this story at Facebook or Twitter.

            "article_content": "The demographic sea change in political power is here, experts say Political gains among women, youth, and minorities will help shape the political conversation Republicans say they will have to figure out how to work with, attract these newly powerful Americans In the days immediately following the presidential election, Martin Mendez was in a blue funk. A Latino Republican, he watched with dismay as poll after poll revealed that not only did President Barack Obama win a second term in office, but he did so with a sizable portion of the Hispanic vote. The loss was especially painful for Mendez, who spent hours knocking on the doors of Hispanics around Denver in an effort to convince them to give the GOP a try. \u201cOut in the field in Denver, the comments I got \u2026 the feedback was Mitt Romney\u2019s for the millionaires. We\u2019re these poor Hispanics, so we\u2019re going to vote for Obama because he\u2019s for the little guy,\u201d Mendez said, his voice full of exasperation. \u201cThere is this class warfare game that Democrats play every single election cycle. We have to start now, reaching out now and not sit on the sidelines until the next cycle,\u201d he said. The growing influence of Latinos, blacks, women and young people in America is not a new story. Demographers have known that at some point the country would become more non-white than white. Social scientists knew that the American landscape was changing, and that change would begin to have profound impact on the nation\u2019s shifting identity. Seven ways religious diversity played in the election Earlier this year, even Romney, in the secretly-recorded video where he attacked the so-called \u201c47%,\u201d understood what was going on. \u201cSo we can capture women\u2019s votes, we\u2019re having a much harder time with Hispanic voters,\u201d he told a gathering of conservative donors. How minorities affected the election Baldwin: Change will move us forward Castro: Latino voters will change Texas The political path forward for GOP \u201cAnd if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting bloc has in the past, why, we\u2019re in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.\u201d For generations, those who knew politics predicted this change would happen one day. On Tuesday, it did. For several election cycles now, women have represented more than half of the electorate yet have been an under-appreciated voting bloc. Add to that the explosive growth of and increased political activism among Latinos, many of whom are younger, under 35. Then there is the generations-long fight for political gains among African Americans, helping culminate in the re-election of the nation\u2019s first black president. The growing political power among other minority groups and vocal youth vote has meant that the party these groups largely back \u2013 Democrats \u2013 netted huge gains during this election cycle. The New America: What the election teaches us about ourselves The new American electorate, it seems, has arrived. And it may be spelling big trouble for Republicans. \u201cThe minority groups that carried President Obama to victory are on track to become a majority of the nation\u2019s population by 2050,\u201d researchers Paul Taylor and D\u2019Vera Cohn wrote in an analysis piece for the Pew Research Center. Taylor added that those groups account for 37% of the population, and cast \u201ca record 28% of the votes in the 2012 presidential election.\u201d For the first time in the nation\u2019s history, women and minorities will hold the majority of the Democratic Party\u2019s House seats, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. However, the Republican side of the aisle will remain largely white and male. Opinion: GOP voter suppression fueled black turnout More women voted for Obama than Romney While it is too early to tell what type of long-term impact these newly powerful Americans will have on the nature of politics, exit polling suggests their impact was felt in both top of the ticket, down-ballot races and state initiatives across the country. According to CNN\u2019s exit polls, 55% of women and 45% of men voted for Obama, while 44% of women and 52% of men voted for Romney. That level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like Ohio where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures. Obama garnered 44% of the Hispanic vote, numbers which likely helped him in places with high Hispanic populations such as Nevada, Colorado and Florida. Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters \u2013 who, according to U.S. Census figures released earlier this year, now represent more than half of the nation\u2019s population born in the past year \u2013 will become more of a power base in places like Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend across the Southwest all the way to California, experts say. The coming political revolution could result in a massive changing of the guard on nearly every level of government, potential cultural clashes from big cities to rural towns, and the type of political alliances that are now considered rare. \u201cI do think that the era that began with Ronald Regan where there was a conservative dominance powered by conservative voters and Southern whites. That era is over,\u201d said David Bositis, a senior political analyst, at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. \u201cAny candidate that wants to run a campaign [now] only at whites is going to lose.\u201d GOP problem: \u2018Their voters are white, aging and dying off\u2019 Obama failed to deliver on a first-term pledge to tackle comprehensive immigration reform. So moving forward, legislative battles over immigration will test the newfound political sway of minorities and the GOP\u2019s ability to redirect on the issue, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cThis will be a test on whether or not Republicans get the message,\u201d Gillespie said, adding, \u201cStrategically, Obama needs to identify pro-immigration Republicans and get them on board pretty quickly. He\u2019s got to figure out which Republicans are hip and realize the game has got to change on immigration and help protect them (so) they feel comfortable enough to defect.\u201d Both parties will also work with a Congress that has seen more women added to its ranks. How women ruled the 2012 election and where the GOP went wrong In Congress, a record 20 women will hold U.S. Senate seats next year\u2014including newly-elected Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the first openly lesbian senator. The New Hampshire congressional delegation will be all female and, in Obama\u2019s home state of Hawaii, Democrat Mazie Hirono will represent the islands in the Senate. In Nebraska, Republican Sen.-elect Debbie Fischer will represent that state. However, there are still hurdles to overcome, said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. \u201cBecause of very clear and specific targeting, Democrats were able to win women,\u201d Lawless said. But, she continued, that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that is how they govern. Moving forward in the direction that will improve women\u2019s social, economic and political autonomy takes time.\u201d Analysis: Obama\u2019s new Democratic majority Changes at the local level, too A mix of ballot initiatives across the country suggests that, despite the political power gains among women and minorities, those groups are not always united on issues. And in places where those groups are outnumbered, state and local laws may not always favor their causes. In Florida, voters rejected a proposal that would have blocked state employees from using their health insurance for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is threatened. In Montana, voters passed a measure requiring parental notification before a doctor can perform an abortion on a minor aged 16 or younger. In Maryland, voters overwhelmingly passed a state version of the DREAM Act allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition. In Montana, roughly 80% of voters approved blocking illegal immigrants from getting such state services as student aid and disability benefits. Maryland and Maine both passed marriage equality initiatives\u2014a topic that polling suggests is broadly supported among young voters in particular. Opinion: How GOP can attract Latino voters The League of Young Voters, a group which targets non-college, minority youth and encourages them to vote, is especially excited by the demographic sea change. Over the next several election cycles, voters can expect to see topics such as immigration reform, climate change, marriage equality and improving juvenile incarceration rates become more of the public policy conversation, said the group\u2019s executive director Rob \u201cBiko\u201d Baker. \u201cYoung people are extremely concerned about climate science and climate change \u2026. a smart elected official will try and connect that with jobs packages, Baker said. \u201cThere needs to be a big conversation about marriage equality. Young people are more tolerant of marriage equality.\u201d As for Mendez, he\u2019s feeling a bit better following Thursday night\u2019s Colorado Hispanic Republicans dinner designed to reach out to Latinos. After all, he was once a Democrat who switched to the GOP after realizing the party was most closely aligned with his own views on abortion, guns and taxes. He\u2019s feeling a bit better that maybe others can be convinced to do likewise. \u201cThe last two days, I\u2019ve been down in the dumps about this election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today I\u2019m excited. We don\u2019t have to move a mountain here, we just have to move a little bit.\u201d Carville: GOP routed by reality",

            "article_content": "Latino vote helped Obama win in battleground states, made up 10% of electorate for first time Navarro: \"If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever\" Latinos voted for Obama over Romney 71% to 27% The sleeping giant has awoken: Latinos not only helped Obama win in key battleground states, but they made up 10% of the electorate for the first time ever. Latinos, the fastest growing minority, making up 16% of the nation\u2019s population, made their mark on election night as they voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney 71% to 27%, a lower percentage than Republican candidates have received in in the last three elections. At 27% this year, Romney\u2019s Latino support is dramatically lower than former President George W. Bush\u2019s support in 2004, which was 44%, and Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s 31% in 2008, according to exit polls. The lowest percentage of Latino voters won by a Republican was in 1996, when Bob Dole garnered only 21% of Latinos compared with then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s record 72%. In 2008, Obama received 67% of the Latino vote. Latinos made up 9% of the electorate in 2008 with 19.5 million people eligible to vote. Today, there are nearly 24 million Hispanics eligible to vote. The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the last four years to 12.2 million, according a  report by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. \u201cIt\u2019s something we saw coming and have seen happen for a numbers of years now. Hispanics are increasing their share of their electorate,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. \u201cThat number has been growing for a number of election cycles, and it\u2019s going to continue to grow moving forward.\u201d What might have swayed Latinos to vote for Obama more than anything else? Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida says the GOP was never able to connect with them. \u201cThe conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them,\u201d Rubio said in a statement on Election Day. Democratic political strategist and commentator for The New Yorker Richard Socarides said on CNN\u2019s Early Start, \u201cYou can have engagement, but if you have no solutions on immigration, people who are concerned about those issues are not going to support you.\u201d Outreach and the message to the Latino community will be vital. In an originally off-the-record interview with the Des Moines Register in October, the president was \u201cconfident about immigration reform in the second term.\u201d \u201cAnd since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\u201d Obama said in a transcript of the interview posted by the paper. \u201cShould I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.\u201d Hispanics were vital in helping the president win in two of the key battleground states,  Nevada (70% to 25%) and Colorado (75% to 23%), and put Obama in the lead in Florida, where the vote still hasn\u2019t been decided, according to exit polls. In Nevada, the president won six electoral votes and nine in Colorado. Obama\u2019s popularity with Latino voters in Florida is credited to the growth in the Puerto Rican population in central Florida.Of all Latinos in Florida, 34% are Cuban and 57% are non-Cuban, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do better with Hispanics, we\u2019ll be out of the White House forever,\u201d said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of McCain\u2019s  presidential campaign. Zuania Cap\u00f3-Ramos of Puerto Rico moved to New York just in time for the 2008 elections, but she didn\u2019t vote until this year. \u201cI had just come to the U.S. and still did not quite understand how to work the election process in this country. I felt misinformed regarding the difference between political parties,\u201d Cap\u00f3-Ramos said. \u201cObama seemed like an excellent candidate, however, it was not until the most recent elections that I became active in American politics and issues affecting the Latino community.\u201d Pew Hispanic Center\u2019s analysis of exit poll data stated that 77% of Hispanic voters said undocumented immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 18% said such immigrants should be deported. Among all voters, fewer than two thirds (65%) said these immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 28% say they should be deported. \u201cWhen Mitt Romney brought on Kris Kobach as his adviser for his campaign, that really made an impact on the Latino community,\u201d said Leo Pierson,  a campaign surrogate for the Ohio Latino Leadership Council to Re-Elect President Obama. Pierson started volunteering in March 2011 and provided guidance on Latino affairs and outreach in Ohio for the campaign. Latinos only make up 3% of the swing state\u2019s population, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, of which Obama received 53% of the Latino vote. \u201cThe GOP drove Latinos away with their anti-Latino agenda in being very vocal on \u2018self-deportation\u2019,\u201d said Pierson. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help that Mitt Romney said the Arizona immigration law was the model for the nation. That stuff sticks.\u201d Romney said he only supported the E-verify portion of the controversial Arizona immigration law, also known as SB 1070. After he made that statement, his opponents were able to characterize his support as being for the entire law, and that alienated many Latino voters. However, Latino voters might have made up their minds in 2011, when Mitt Romney stated he would veto the DREAM Act, but his reluctance during the second presidential debate to provide specifics on an alternative approach on immigration reform could have sealed the deal for most Latinos. Romney said that he would offer a path to undocumented immigrants serving in the military but did not give details as to what he would do for the remainder of the 1.4 million undocumented immigrants who would qualify for citizenship under Obama\u2019s plan, which allows undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to apply for legal status. While some Hispanic voters were disappointed with  Obama\u2019s failure to achieve comprehensive immigration reform, which he considered his \u201cbiggest failure,\u201d he said it wasn\u2019t \u201cfor a lack of trying or desire,\u201d during a Univision forum in September. However, that doesn\u2019t relieve the pressure many Latinos have put upon the newly re-elected president. \u201cMy hope for Obama as a woman, as a Latina, as a Puerto Rican, is that he keeps his word and all the promises he has made to us,\u201d stressed Cap\u00f3-Ramos. \u201cI hope he conserves his integrity, prevails in government, and that he puts the people as priority over economic interests, political or partisan.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Federal judges serve for life, which means a president can shape a far-ranging legacy Obama named two Supreme Court justices in his first term Four of the current justices are in their 70s Obama has placed 72 women in the federal courts, most ever in a single presidential term Between 1969 and 1993, all 11 justices confirmed to the Supreme Court were named by Republican presidents. Now the re-election of President Barack Obama promises to continue reshifting the balance of federal courts toward a more progressive stage, a legacy of judicial power that may be felt for decades. Obama has already named two justices to the top bench \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 and it is possible he might name two or more in his second term. \u201cWith the president re-elected, I think it\u2019s very likely that Ruth (Bader) Ginsburg, the justice who\u2019s the oldest (at age 79), will retire within the third year of a second term, leaving the president time to get another nominee in there,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, a top appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com publisher. \u201cOther than retirement, I think \u2013 absent health problems \u2013 the justices are not too anxious to leave. They all really like their jobs, it\u2019s a good job, and they all seem to be in great shape.\u201d Opinion: Where Obama, and America, go from here Federal judges serve for life, giving the president the political opportunity to shape a legacy that will long outlive his or her public service. Besides Ginsburg, three other justices are in their 70s: fellow liberal Stephen Breyer, who is 74; and Republican appointees Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, both 76. Many conservative court watchers predict Obama will not dramatically alter his criteria for selecting judges, an approach driven in large part by political reality. \u201cAs the president himself said, he\u2019ll have a lot more \u2018flexibility,\u2019 so he could appoint someone who\u2019s more of a hard left,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group. \u201cFrankly, he has already appointed a very solid, intelligent, articulate liberal in Elena Kagan. Justice Kagan, I think, in many ways is sort of a left Scalia. She\u2019s by no means in the center. She votes lock-step with Justice Ginsburg.\u201d While Democrats control the Senate \u2013 the body that must confirm all nominees \u2013 the Republican minority has been successful blocking two Obama appeals court picks deemed to be \u201cactivist\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d by the right \u2013 Californian Goodwin Liu and New Yorker Caitlin Halligan. For its part, the current conservative-majority high court has not been shy in adding some of the hottest political and social issues onto its docket. This year alone, the justices tackled immigration reform, affirmative action and the blockbuster health care reform law \u2013 a late-June majority ruling giving the president a major victory. And the justices in coming days are set to decide whether to hear pending appeals on same-sex marriage and voting rights enforcement by the federal government. 15 Supreme Court cases that changed America \u201cThe Supreme Court and its ideological divide is really placing the Constitution and the country in many ways at a crossroads,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cWhere President Obama could have a big impact on the court is if one of the more conservative justices, like swing vote Anthony Kennedy or Justice Anton Scalia \u2013 if they retired, then President Obama could replace a conservative or a right-leaning moderate with a liberal justice and that would really shape the outcome of Supreme Court rulings for quite a while.\u201d Some liberal groups have criticized the Obama White House for being less than aggressive in his first term naming proven progressives to the federal courts \u2013 including district, and appeals vacancies. The number of judicial nominations by the current president has lagged by the dozens behind recent chief executives, and those nominees have on average been four years older than those named by President George W. Bush, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution expert on judicial nominations. But publicly, liberals say they are encouraged the courts will receive greater political attention over the next four years. \u201cWe look forward to working with the president on a robust justice agenda,\u201d said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice. \u201cThat agenda must include a renewed commitment to civil liberties and leaving a legacy of judicial appointments that support our values of fairness and equal justice under law.\u201d White House sources have acknowledged privately that Obama put judicial picks on a lower political priority in his first term, for the most part choosing what they characterize as moderate, non-ideological, non-controversial \u2013 and confirmable \u2013 slates of judges. Those sources said the strategy reflected the president\u2019s own personal views that judges should not bring sharp partisanship to their jobs, but also political reality: Obama did not want to be sidelined fighting culture wars over judges with Republicans, while trying to repair the ailing economy and push health care reform. Photos: Justice Roberts on the high court His supporters also blame Senate Republicans for opposing many of the president\u2019s choices, even ones Democrats deemed well within the mainstream. Both sides of the aisle blame the other for abandoning an unofficial 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases. Republicans for their part say they cannot be criticized for the president being slow to bring judicial nominees to the Senate, and have said the rates of confirmation are consistent with previous administrations. White House officials have emphasized diversity of the bench over hard numbers. Obama has successfully placed 72 women in the federal courts, the most ever in a single presidential term. It matches the number Bush named in his eight years from 2001-09. President Clinton named 111 female judges in his two terms. From 1993 to 2017 Democratic presidents will have served 16 of those 24 years, approaching in judicial impact what Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and George H.W Bush did in their terms. \u201cI think filling the lower court benches is going to be key,\u201d said Severino. \u201cThat\u2019s something, much to my relief, actually, (that) President Obama hasn\u2019t focused on as much this past term. He did get his two Supreme Court nominations, which is huge, and has a great impact. But there\u2019s also the long-term impact of filling the district court and the circuit-court spots, and that\u2019s what is going to provide a deeper bench later on. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see if President Obama decides to switch his emphasis and fill more of those judicial vacancies or continues to embrace that as a lower priority.\u201d Of more immediate concern to the rank-and-file federal courts: the pending $7 trillion \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d of mandatory federal tax increases and spending cuts if a budget deal is not reached by early January. Economists fear another journey back to a recession if things are left unchanged. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, in a letter obtained by CNN, warned a proposed 8.2% across-the-board sequestration cut in judicial funding would be \u201cdevastating,\u201d potentially forcing employee downsizing, and reductions in court security, even fees paid to public defenders and citizens for jury service.",

            "article_content": "Montreal-based immigration attorney says Americans simply too patriotic to flee homeland Airwaves, social media filled with bluster, but expert says this year it's 'palpably ugly' Two arrested at University of Mississippi after racial epithets uttered at campus protest No unrest in Lubbock County, Texas, despite 'civil war' prediction by judge It happens every four years, usually right around September. Calls come in from all over the United States from people threatening to flee their homeland if a candidate they despise wins the Oval Office. \u201cThat\u2019s the amazing thing, when they speak on the phone. They\u2019re adamant. They feel very, very strong about it,\u201d said David Cohen, a Montreal-based immigration lawyer. \u201c\u2018This government doesn\u2019t speak for me\u2019 is the language that we often hear.\u201d As a partner at the Campbell Cohen firm, which specializes in immigration to Canada, Cohen says he has received these calls for decades. It sometimes makes him \u201cfeel like a therapist because they vent for a while, get this cathartic release.\u201d But when it comes down to it,  Americans don\u2019t move to Canada unless it\u2019s for a relationship or new job \u2013 essentially, love and money. Opinion: Where Obama, and America, go from here Cohen says he can remember only three of four cases in more than 30 years that involved someone actually making good on their threat to move to Canada to escape an American president. Durbin addresses bipartisanship GOP lawmaker: Obama bipartisanship lacking Texas judge: Civil war if Obama wins How to teach kids about politics This election cycle, he said, most of the calls \u201ctended to be conservative or Romney supporters. There were not as many from the other side, so maybe they had kind of a premonition.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the election season\u2019s bluster cycle, and while partisan hot air is typical this time of year, this year\u2019s squabbling has been \u201cpalpably ugly,\u201d even if most of it is just talk, said Jerrold Post, director of George Washington University\u2019s political psychology program and author of \u201cPolitical Paranoia: The Psychopolitics of Hatred.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s always been the case: more extreme talk than actions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can entertain any idea you want to, but there\u2019s a difference between having an idea and acting on an idea.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d Post added, \u201cthrow enough ugly ideas into a pot and something is going to boil over.\u201d Sure, Facebook and Twitter were rife with threats to leave the country if Barack Obama or Mitt Romney won, but we\u2019ve also seen the more serious headlines. Bryan Fischer of the evangelical group the American Family Association reportedly said last week, \u201cI think there will be blood\u201d if Obama wins. In north Georgia, the president of the Cottages of Woodstock homeowners\u2019 association, a residential community for the elderly, said he would shut the complex\u2019s gates for fear of \u201cnegative repercussions (that) may occur because of the results of the election,\u201d The New York Times reported. In August, Lubbock County, Texas, Judge Tom Head warned that the country could descend into civil war if Obama was re-elected and, as the county\u2019s emergency management coordinator, he considered whether he\u2019d have to \u201ccall out the militia\u201d if Obama ordered U.N. troops to quell the uprising. Opinion: Obama\u2019s critics, repudiated at last More recently, after Tuesday\u2019s election results came in, real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump called for \u201crevolution!\u201d and urged his 1.8 million Twitter followers to \u201cmarch on Washington and stop this travesty.\u201d He further called on them to \u201cfight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice,\u201d while proclaiming the country was now in \u201cserious and unprecedented trouble\u2026like never before.\u201d Trump has since deleted the revolution missive. Post noted that Trump was at the forefront of the so-called \u201cbirther movement,\u201d which falsely claims Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States, so he wasn\u2019t surprised to see Trump sound off, but \u201cthe intensity of that was rather shocking.\u201d Best Election Night tweets Asked if he thought Obama\u2019s race played a part in the vitriolic nature of the polemics around the country, Post said it \u201cseems to be an issue that was played upon, but you can certainly have hatred and delegitimization with two white candidates as well.\u201d One place where race played a factor is Oxford, Mississippi, where Ole Miss students \u201cexchanged racial epithets and violent, politicized chants\u201d after Obama\u2019s re-election was announced, according to the student-run Daily Mississippian. University police had to \u201cforcibly disperse\u201d a crowd from a popular gathering spot on campus, the paper said. Americans at the end of the day are just a very patriotic group, and it doesn\u2019t matter what side you\u2019re on. David Cohen, Canadian immigration attorney A university statement said the crowd reached 400 people at its pinnacle, and there were only two arrests for disorderly conduct. School Chancellor Dan Jones was quoted as saying Ole Miss \u201cuniversally condemned\u201d the racial epithets and uncivil language, and he regretted that a few students had tarnished the reputations of those classmates \u201cwho are more representative of our university creed.\u201d Obama makes history again It appeared to be an isolated incident. In Lubbock County, GOP chairman Carl Tepper chuckled when asked if Judge Head\u2019s ominous prediction about Obama\u2019s re-election had come to fruition. \u201cNo unrest,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot of disappointed people.\u201d The staunchly conservative county voted more than seven to three for Romney, he said, so now the focus moves to strengthening the Republican Party and \u201ccarrying our message of self-reliance to the rest of the country.\u201d \u201cRepublicans are pretty naturally a law-and-order-type people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still satisfied America has this amazing, peaceful process of selecting government. No matter who wins, we still have our rights, our businesses, our schools, and life goes on. We\u2019ll get \u2018em next time.\u201d So, there are no tanks rolling through the nations\u2019 metropolises, no disappointed partisans reaching for their rifles. As Tepper said, life goes on, as it does after each election cycle, despite the disappointment of those in the losing candidate\u2019s camp. And those souls who swear they\u2019re abandoning this land for fear of Obama turning tyrannical in his second term? Yeah, not happening. Obama photo a social-media sensation Cohen, the immigration lawyer, said that though the calls inquiring about Canadian citizenship will continue for the next few months, he feels Americans are simply too loyal to leave the country they love. \u201cI\u2019ve had Americans tell me this: When your national anthem plays, the hair on their arms stands up, and that\u2019s not like most people in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans at the end of the day are just a very patriotic group, and it doesn\u2019t matter what side you\u2019re on.\u201d Post said he hopes bipartisanship will take hold on Capitol Hill, but it won\u2019t be easy because each party is torn by conflicting ideals: catering to their bases and governing in the best interest of the people. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to reach across the aisle and get slapped down, but that\u2019s what has to happen. There\u2019s a lot of wounds to heal,\u201d Post said. No shortage of pressing issues for Obama\u2019s next term",

            "article_content": "The president increased his support with Latinos, the fastest growing segment of the population Changes in the size of the youth vote and the white vote worked in Obama's favor The auto bailout helped Obama in Ohio, a crucial battleground Romney failed to expand the map and lost in Pennsylvania and Minnesota The 2012 presidential election shattered spending records, further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags. The race appeared to be a nail-biter going into Tuesday night but in the end, it came down to the state that most had been saying for weeks that it would \u2014 Ohio. Here are five things we learned from Tuesday Victorious Obama faces familiar challenges 1. The GOP has a Latino problem \u201cIf we don\u2019t do better with Hispanics, we\u2019ll be out of the White House forever,\u201d says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. Romney concedes election Speeches show common themes Gergen: Win shows desire for moderation \u201cThe big issue Republicans are going to have to wrestle with is the Hispanic issue,\u201d adds Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s first press secretary. \u201cRepublicans are going to have to find a different way forward.\u201d The national exit polls tell the story. Latinos are the fastest growing-segment of the population. Their share of the vote expanded from 9% in 2008 to 10% in this election. The president won 67% of the vote four years ago. He increased that to 71% this year. Latinos were crucial in helping Obama win the battleground states of Colorado and Nevada, and in putting the president in the lead for Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes. And they were just as important in turning the former swing state of New Mexico into what appears to be an increasingly safe state for the Democrats. CNN Election Center: 2012 exit polls If the current trend continues, Arizona and Texas could turn from red to purple. The 2012 election is a loud wake-up call for the GOP to change its stance on illegal immigration. And that\u2019s being acknowledged by arguably the best known Latino Republican senator. \u201cThe conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night. Opinion: Five things Obama must do 2. The youth vote came up big \u2014 and the white vote got smaller A big question heading into Election Day was whether younger voters would show up at the polls. More of them did than last time. According to national exit polls, 18-29 year olds increased from 17% to 18% of the electorate from 2004 to 2008. They made up 19% of the electorate this time around. That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president\u2019s drop in capturing the youth vote, from 66% in 2008 to 60% in 2012. It wasn\u2019t just age, but also race, that worked in the president\u2019s favor. Obama\u2019s share of the white vote dropped from 43% four years ago to 39% this year. But that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74% of the electorate four years ago to 72% now. And the African-American percentage of the electorate stayed steady at 13%. Some GOP strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74% for Romney to win. \u201cThe youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that\u2019s to the president\u2019s credit,\u201d Fleischer said. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms 3. The auto bailouts helped drive Obama to victory in Ohio For months, the Obama campaign touted the taxpayer bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler, and they were given prominent prime-time placement during the Democratic National Convention in early September. It\u2019s a strategy that the Obama campaign thought could be the difference in Ohio, a major base for the auto industry that eventually decided the election. \u201cThe American auto industry is back on top,\u201d Obama said campaigning last week in the Buckeye State. The bailouts were started under President George W. Bush in 2008 but Obama grabbed the keys to the program the next year, managing and funding the assistance. Romney opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed and managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. The Obama campaign and other Democrats have attacked Romney over his opposition to the federal intervention, which aided the companies through their eventual bankruptcies. And in the final weeks leading up the the election, the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China. Portman stands by Romney auto ads It seemed to work. Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government\u2019s role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters. Economy tops voter concerns in exit polls 4. Romney wasn\u2019t able to expand the map Much was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election, and Romney\u2019s return to the Keystone State on Election Day. The Romney campaign and allied super PACs supporting the GOP nominee flooded Pennsylvania airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads. To a lesser degree, there was a similar push in Minnesota, another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month. There was talk by Romney campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map. It didn\u2019t pan out. While Romney performed stronger than 2008 Republican nominee John McCain in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it wasn\u2019t enough. And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago, it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again. Romney\u2019s \u2018all\u2019 proved not enough 5. What will $6 billion get you? We had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election. And we\u2019ll have a Democrat in the White House, with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate after the election. When all the bills are in, total spending for the 2012 election (all federal and state races) could top a record-breaking $6 billion. And what did all that money buy? 2012 election priciest to date: $4.2 billion tab and rising Some would argue \u2026 nothing.",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans blame Sandy, stances on social issues for Romney loss Others say Obama's ground game was underestimated Loss of young, minority voters is sign party may be out of touch with fast-growing demographics Former GOP chairman questions whether Paul Ryan was best running mate pick Before Republicans went looking for answers Tuesday night, some of them went looking for the remote. When it became clear about midnight that President Barack Obama was safely on the way to re-election, a handful of cranky and inebriated Republican donors wandered about Romney\u2019s election night headquarters, angrily demanding that the giant television screens inside the ballroom be switched from CNN to Fox News, where Republican strategist Karl Rove was making frantic, face-saving pronouncements about how Ohio was not yet lost. Romney\u2019s \u2018all\u2019 proved not enough Rove was wrong, of course. But the signs of desperation inside the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on Tuesday night were symptomatic of a Republican Party now standing at a crossroads, with not much track in sight. 2 men, 2 speeches, 1 message A six-year road to defeat for Romney See the president's full victory speech New term, familiar challenges for Obama How did Romney lose a race that seemed so tantalizingly within reach just one week ago? \u201cWe were this close,\u201d one of Romney\u2019s most senior advisers sighed after watching the Republican nominee concede. \u201cThis close.\u201d Little support from young, minorities Some answers are easy. Romney lost embarrassingly among young people, African-Americans and Hispanics, a brutal reminder for Republicans that their party is ideologically out of tune with fast-growing segments of the population. Obama crushed Romney among Hispanic voters by a whopping 44 points, a margin of victory that likely propelled the president to victories in Nevada, Colorado and possibly Florida. Five things we learned from Election Night The stunning defeat alarmed Republicans who fear extinction unless the party can figure out how to temper the kind of hardline immigration rhetoric that Romney delivered during his Republican primary bid. \u201cLatinos were disillusioned with Barack Obama, but they are absolutely terrified by the idea of Mitt Romney,\u201d said GOP fundraiser Ana Navarro, a confidante to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. Analysis: Obama won with a better ground game Sandy upsets campaign \u2018momentum\u2019 Beyond the ugly math staring them in the face, Romney\u2019s top aides and the Republican heavyweights who populated the somber ballroom Tuesday evening offered an array of explanations for their loss. With some of them double-fisting beers and others sipping bourbon, members of Romney\u2019s team blamed several factors that were, in some ways, beyond their control. Many campaign aides pointed the finger at Sandy, the punishing superstorm and October surprise that razed the East Coast and consumed news coverage for what was supposed to be the final full week of campaigning. Analysis: Obama\u2019s new Democratic majority It upset the dynamic of a campaign that had been reset during the first debate in Denver, where Obama delivered a wilting-flower act in full view of the American populace that allowed Romney to seize control of the race and set the terms for the final fall sprint. The storm, former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN on Sunday, \u201cbroke Romney\u2019s momentum.\u201d After being criticized in the media for focusing on \u201csmall things\u201d like Big Bird and \u201cRomnesia,\u201d Sandy offered Obama a chance to once again look presidential. There also are very real hard feelings inside the Romney camp about the way New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, seemed to lavish praise on Obama in the wake of Sandy\u2019s destruction, allowing Obama to appear bipartisan just as Romney was attacking him for being petty and partisan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to bear hug the guy,\u201d complained one Romney insider. \u201cIt won\u2019t be forgotten easily,\u201d grumbled another about Christie. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate Social conservatives blame squishy positions As Romney aides began the soul-searching that usually follows a loss, Republicans outside the campaign began pointing fingers at the team. Some social conservatives were quick to rip open barely healed wounds, claiming that Romney\u2019s squishy positions on abortion and same-sex marriage \u2013 closely scrutinized during both of his Republican primary campaigns \u2013 left grass-roots Republicans uninspired. \u201cWhat was presented as discipline by the Romney campaign by staying on one message, the economy, was a strategic error that resulted in a winning margin of pro-life votes being left on the table,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List. Some wondered aloud about the selection of Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as Romney\u2019s running mate, suggesting that a Republican from a more winnable battleground state might have made a difference. GOP retains grip on House \u201cRob Portman would\u2019ve been worth 1% in Ohio,\u201d said former Ohio GOP Chairman Kevin DeWine. \u201cMarco Rubio would\u2019ve been worth a point in Florida. Bob McDonnell would\u2019ve been worth a point in Virginia.\u201d The Romney team and his super PAC allies, some Republicans are already saying, ran a banal series of television ads and allowed their candidate to be defined early on by Obama as an outsourcing plutocrat who wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt. Their pushback seemed feeble for most of the summer and early autumn. And crucially, Romney never seemed to articulate a clear rationale for the presidency. The campaign\u2019s decision to air a misleading ad in Toledo media market about Chrysler moving Jeep production to China during the closing days of the race is also emerging as a prime reason for Romney\u2019s loss in the state he needed to win most. One senior Ohio Republican called the Jeep ad a \u201cdesperate\u201d move and said the Romney campaign walked into a \u201chornet\u2019s nest\u201d of negative press coverage. Nick Everhart, a Columbus-based ad maker, blamed the Ohio loss, in part, on the Romney campaign\u2019s \u201cpoor media buying.\u201d But an adviser to one prominent Republican governor who campaigned for Romney said the campaign\u2019s problems were more fundamental. \u201cObama ran a very smart but very small campaign, which he could afford to do because he was running against a very small opponent,\u201d this Republican said. \u201cThe fundamentals of the election were the same all along, and they were this: When there\u2019s an incumbent no one wants to vote for, and a challenger that no one wants to vote for, people will vote for the incumbent. At no point did Romney give people any reason to vote for him, and so they didn\u2019t.\u201d Democrats keep control of Senate Democrats\u2019 strong ground game Romney may never have been the GOP\u2019s dream candidate, but even if he were, Republicans would still have been forced to confront another troubling structural problem on Election Day. Democrats showed decisively that their ground game \u2013 the combined effort to find, persuade and turn out voters \u2013 is devastatingly better than anything their rivals have to offer. In 2004, Republicans tapped the science of microtargeting to redefine campaigns. That is now ancient history. \u201cWhen it comes to the use of voter data and analytics, the two sides appear to be as unmatched as they have ever been on a specific electioneering tactic in the modern campaign era,\u201d Sasha Issenberg, a journalist and an expert in the science of campaigning, wrote just days before the election proved him right. \u201cNo party ever has ever had such a durable structural advantage over the other on polling, making television ads, or fundraising, for example.\u201d The Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee entered Election Day boasting about the millions of voter contacts \u2013 door knocks and phone calls \u2013 they had made in all the key states. Volunteers were making the calls using an automated VOIP-system, allowing them to dial registered voters at a rapid clip and punch in basic data about them on each phone\u2019s keypad, feeding basic information into the campaign\u2019s voter file. But volunteer callers were met with angry hang-ups and answering machines just as much as actual voters on the other end of the line. It was a voter contact system that favored quantity over quality. At the same time, the campaign\u2019s door-to-door canvassing effort was heavily reliant on fired-up but untrained volunteers. Obama organizers, meanwhile, had been deeply embedded in small towns and big cities for years, focusing their persuasion efforts on person-to-person contact. The more nuanced data they collected, often with handwritten notes attached, were synced nightly with their prized voter database in Chicago. After the dust had cleared, the GOP field operation, which had derided the Obama operation and gambled on organic Republican enthusiasm to push them over the top, seemed built on a house of cards. \u201cTheir deal was much more real than I expected,\u201d one top Republican with close ties to the Romney campaign said of the Obama field team. Sources involved in the GOP turnout effort admitted they were badly outmatched in the field by an Obama get-out-the-vote operation that lived up to their immense hype \u2013 except, perhaps, in North Carolina, where Romney was able to pull out a win and Republicans swept to power across the state. Multiple Romney advisers were left agog at the turnout ninjutsu performed by the Obama campaign, both in early voting and on Election Day. Not only did Obama field marshals get their targeted supporters to the polls, they found new voters and even outperformed their watershed 2008 showings in some decisive counties, a remarkable feat in a race that was supposed to see dampened Democratic turnout. In Florida\u2019s Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, the Obama campaign outpaced their final 2008 tally by almost 6,000 votes. In Nevada\u2019s vote-rich Clark County, Obama forces scrounged up almost 9,000 more votes than they did four years ago. Tuesday\u2019s outcome laid bare this truth: The two campaigns placed very different bets on the nature of the 2012 electorate, and the Obama campaign won decisively. Romney officials had modeled an electorate that looked something like a mix of 2004 and 2008, only this time, Democratic turnout would be depressed, and the most motivated voters would be whites, seniors, Republicans and independents. Heading into Election Day, the Romney campaign\u2019s final set of internal poll numbers showed their candidate with a 6-point lead in New Hampshire, a 3-point lead in Colorado, a 2-point lead in Iowa, a 3-point lead in Florida and near ties in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Ohio was their biggest problem. According to the campaign\u2019s internal polls obtained by CNN, Romney was trailing in the must-win state by a full 5 points on the Sunday before the election, the last day of tracking. Officials in Boston dispatched Romney for a pair of 11th-hour campaign stops in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, a show of Election Day vitality and confidence that was, in reality, a last-ditch attempt to move the needle with just hours until the polls closed. The Obama campaign was of a different mindset. Late last month, a few days before Halloween, four members of Obama\u2019s senior campaign staff \u2013 deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter, pollster Joel Benenson, battleground state director Mitch Stewart and press secretary Ben LaBolt \u2013 flew from Chicago to Washington to brief reporters on the state of the race. With the president\u2019s campaign on the ropes in the wake of his awful debate performance in Denver, the quartet had a straightforward, math-driven sales pitch. The share of the national white vote would decline as it has steadily in every election since 1992. There would be modest upticks in Hispanic and African-American voter registration, shifts that would overwhelmingly favor the president. And Obama\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation was vastly more sophisticated than the one being run by Romney and the Republican National Committee. On Monday, the night before the election, the Obama campaign was optimistic their vision would pan out. A relaxed group of about 60 campaign staffers including campaign manager Jim Messina decamped to Houlihan\u2019s, just up the street from their Chicago headquarters on Michigan Avenue, to drink beers and take in Obama\u2019s final speech in Des Moines on C-SPAN. The following morning, bagels were delivered to headquarters for breakfast. Pizza was on the menu for dinner. Some staffers in the in the campaign\u2019s press wing turned on the Oxygen channel to watch a marathon of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d \u2013 a \u201cmindless escape,\u201d in the words of one campaign operative.  When the results started flowing in, each chapter appeared to unfold as planned. The office burst into loud cheers when Pennsylvania and Wisconsin turned blue early in the evening, two very large pieces of mortar in a growing electoral roadblock for Romney. And when Ohio was called for the president, the year-long avalanche of G-chats, e-mails and text messages between reporters and campaign sources fell silent as Obama-world closed ranks to celebrate their hard-won \u2013 and meticulously planned \u2013 victory.",

            "article_content": "Obama's victory is a testament to a changing America Romney's coalition bore a striking resemblance to John McCain's four years ago Romney won a small majority of independents, but not enough to make a difference Results show Republican party facing a demographics problem If you want to understand the historical magnitude of President Obama\u2019s re-election victory, start with this fact: He lost the white vote by 20 points. In 1988, Mike Dukakis lost white voters by 19 points. He was crushed in a 40-state landslide. Obama\u2019s victory is a testament to a changing America. The president won a second term in the face of a weak economy by reassembling the bulk of his 2008 coalition: Hispanics, African-Americans, younger voters and single women. Mitt Romney\u2019s support was older, whiter, and more Protestant than the president\u2019s \u2013 a faded shadow of a time gone by. It also bore a striking resemblance to Sen. John McCain\u2019s coalition four years ago. Re-election puts Obama to the test A few specifics: Obama won Latino voters by nearly 40 points \u2013 a slightly larger margin than his total over McCain four years ago \u2013 while the Latino share of the total vote crept up from 9% to 10%. Romney\u2019s tough talk on illegal immigration and self-deportation may have helped him win the GOP nomination, but it cost him in the fall. See data on who voted for whom Fiscal cliff awaits Obama and the world Van Hollen: 'It was a decisive election' Black voters were 13% of the total electorate, the same share as in 2008 but a bump up from typical modern turnout levels. The first black president\u2019s share of the black vote actually dropped a couple of points, but was still far north of 90%. Talk of black alienation because of resistance on issues like same-sex marriage was overblown. Voters age 18 to 29 comprised a slightly larger share of the electorate than in 2008, an outcome contrary to the media narrative of a disenchanted youth alienated from the political process. Obama\u2019s share of the young vote declined a bit, but he still won it well in excess of 20 points. What we learned from the election In the final days before the election, hopeful Republicans played up polls showing Romney running away with the independent vote. It didn\u2019t pan out. Romney won independents by 4% \u2013 a healthy 12-point swing for the GOP compared to 2008 \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to save the former Massachusetts governor. Republicans also hoped a 7-point Democratic Party ID turnout edge over the GOP in 2008 would shrivel this time around. It didn\u2019t.  Democrats maintained a 6-point edge on Tuesday. In the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio, Obama may have been saved by the 2009 auto industry bailout.  Ohio voters approved of the bailout by a 23-point margin, and bailout supporters in the Buckeye State backed the president over Romney by about 50 points. Obama makes history again Perhaps in a related vein, Obama won 42% of working class whites in Ohio, compared to 36% of working class whites nationwide \u2013 a critical difference in the tightly contested state. Where does the GOP go from here?  The Republican brand remains extremely strong among southern whites and religious voters in particular.  Conservative leaders can find solace both in their tightening grip on the House of Representatives and a promising political bench featuring rising stars like Wisconsin rep. Paul Ryan, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, to name just a few. But even the most cursory glance at the results of the past two presidential elections makes it clear that the Republican Party is now facing a growing demographic problem. It risks permanently losing a new generation of Americans \u2013 a generation central to Obama\u2019s twin White House victories. How Republicans address this problem will play a huge role in determining the shape of American politics long after Obama himself has exited the political stage.

            "article_content": "Romney says he gave all to his campaign He concedes election to Obama Romney had to fight an image of being out of touch But a friend says the nominee was far from the caricature he was portrayed to be In the end, the Etch A Sketch didn\u2019t work. Mitt Romney, the multimillionaire who touted his business credentials as the Republican presidential hopeful, failed to convince voters that he was the man to unseat President Barack Obama and jump-start the economy. \u201cWe have given our all to this campaign,\u201d Romney told supporters in his concession speech. \u201cI so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader, and so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and this great nation.\u201d The result brought an end to Romney\u2019s longtime ambitions to become the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief. He had come up short in the GOP primary in 2008, but maintained his ambition and launched his 2012 candidacy on a farm in New Hampshire. Opinion: Romney couldn\u2019t overcome contradictions A six-year road to defeat for Romney 2007: Romney addresses Mormon faith Speeches show common themes Romney campaign plans failed to launch Photos: From the campaign trail He stumped across the nation, focusing on key swing states such as Ohio and Florida, selling himself as the ultimate alternative to Obama \u2013 a man who understood how to fix the economy and who had worked across the aisle as governor in largely Democratic Massachusetts. \u201cAmerica is a land of opportunity. But lately, for too many Americans, opportunity has not exactly come knocking,\u201d Romney wrote in a recent opinion piece on CNN.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mired in an economic slowdown that has left millions of our fellow citizens unemployed. The consequences in dreams shattered, lives disrupted, plans deferred, and hopes dimmed can be found all around us.\u201d The son of a former Michigan governor and auto executive, Romney has long been known among friends for his leadership skills. \u201cThis guy is impressive as far as executive ability goes,\u201d Romney friend Philip Barlow wrote his mom in 1982. \u201cI think he could be president of the United States.\u201d Reflecting on that note now, Barlow said, \u201cI was that impressed with his executive abilities and him as a leader.\u201d Barlow is a professor of Mormon history and culture and the director of the religious studies program at Utah State University. He served as one of two counselors to then-Bishop Romney in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Portrayals of Romney as \u201cbeing out of touch with the poor seem kind of silly to me,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cI knew him on that level of real human stuff as opposed to the public image,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cThe man that I knew is not a caricature. He\u2019s not a man without compassion for the poor.\u201d But it is that image of Romney \u2013 an out-of-touch rich guy who shipped jobs overseas as the head of Bain Capital \u2013 that stuck. During various stages along the way, Romney said \u201ccorporations are people\u201d and that he \u201clikes being able to fire people.\u201d And that was long before his now infamous 47% moocher line. Romney\u2019s Republican opponents in the primaries, and the Obama campaign and Democrats after that, helped create that caricature, defining Romney to the electorate before Romney tried to show them who he was. At one point, senior Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom said the fall campaign is \u201clike Etch A Sketch. You can shake it up and we start all over again.\u201d It was a comment that dogged the campaign and only served as political fodder of Romney as a flip-flopper, waffler and a candidate with no core values. GOP expands majority in governors\u2019 mansions But even then, he won the GOP primary, although evangelicals initially were lukewarm to embrace a Mormon who seemed disconnected with the Republican base. Trailing Obama in polls through the summer, Romney did try to shake up the Etch A Sketch picture he had created of himself as a \u201cseverely conservative\u201d candidate, as he once described himself before a gathering of conservatives, tacking to the center in the last weeks of the campaign. But that might have only hurt him, contributing to the image of a politician with no firm convictions. The fallout late Tuesday was almost immediate within the party. How could Obama have won in an electoral landslide when the economy is sluggish, the country is polarized and a sizable chunk of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track? \u201cThe takeaway is that a candidate can run for office with a lot of money, but when it takes him until March of 2012 to even get 25% support within his own party, you\u2019re running a weak nominee,\u201d said Erick Erickson, RedState.com editor and CNN contributor. The tea party was quick to jump on the defeat. \u201cWhat we got was a weak moderate candidate, hand-picked by the Beltway elites and country-club establishment wing of the Republican Party,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots. The strong language served as a salvo to the GOP and a sign of the potential civil war ahead within the party. Romney had emerged from the primary season as the best alternative after the GOP cycled through a series of hard-line conservatives. In doing so, the once-moderate Massachusetts governor turned to the right, on abortion, health care and immigration. Even within the Republican Party, many wondered what Romney\u2019s principles were: Was he the pro-health care governor who supported abortion rights, or the GOP candidate who pledged to repeal Obamacare and spoke against abortion rights? And why was he not touting his economic vision for the country more? \u201cYou can make the case against Mitt Romney that he didn\u2019t sell those business credentials well enough,\u201d said Gloria Borger, CNN\u2019s chief political analyst. \u201cThere will be some Republicans who say it wasn\u2019t us. It was him.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s pretty common agreement,\u201d Erickson added, \u201cthat he really didn\u2019t run a campaign on the big ideas that he claims. He was rather guarded, even through the debates, on what exactly he was and was not going to do. The Obama campaign hounded him a lot on what his plan was.\u201d The presidential election results are seen as a repudiation of the Republican Party. Most pundits predicted a bitter battle within the party on immigration \u2013 that if the far right doesn\u2019t change its intractable position, then the GOP is doomed down the road. GOP retains control of the House \u201cThe Republican Party needs to move forward, not sideways,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. Castellanos, who was a Romney adviser in 2008, compared this moment to the early 1990s for Democrats, when Bill Clinton brought the party closer to the center. \u201cThey transformed their party. Republicans are still seen as the party of not having enough solutions,\u201d Castellanos  said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a failing, tanking economy going over the cliff \u2013 and the opposition party was not seen as an alternative.\u201d CNN senior political analyst David Gergen agreed, saying it\u2019s imperative that the GOP transform itself. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unhealthy for the country to have a Republican Party that relies on whites for about 90% of their national vote,\u201d he said. Borger said President George W. Bush was rebuffed by the GOP base when he pushed for immigration reform 10 years ago \u2013 a stance she said haunted this election for Republicans. \u201cWhen you look back on this election, when you look back to the primaries, when you look back to Mitt Romney moving to the right on immigration,\u201d Borger said, \u201cI think it was a huge opportunity that they missed.\u201d There will be gnashing of teeth in the days, weeks and months ahead. What lies in store for the Republican Party remains a long way off. Shortly before 1 a.m. Wednesday, Romney walked onto a stage in Boston and told the crowd he had called Obama to congratulate him on the victory. \u201cI pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation,\u201d he said. At the end, he walked from the podium to the middle of the stage and gave his wife, Ann, a kiss. Running mate Paul Ryan and his wife, Janna, and Romney family members joined him. The crowd chanted, \u201cMitt! Mitt! Mitt!\u201d He and Ann then walked hand-in-hand. The Romneys exited stage right.

Ted Strickland exhorted the audience to vote for President Barack Obama because GOP hopeful Mitt Romney and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan have \u201cto fake compassion.\u201d If you think that sounds unusually cutting, go a few hundred miles across the country to a Romney rally where Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, told his home state crowd he wonders of the president, \u201cHow much do you really love the country you are in charge of?\u201d These aren\u2019t average campaign season contrasts. Coming from mainstream political leaders, they reflect a bitter mood in the political class that will make governing hard no matter who wins on Election Day. If Romney takes the White House\u2026 Adding to the level of difficulty, the partisan balance of Congress is likely to remain essentially the same. Democrats are poised to retain control of the Senate but with a smaller margin. Republicans are expected to retain power in the House also with a narrower majority. Divided control with parties wielding even less power in each chamber means consensus will be even more illusory. If Obama is victorious on Tuesday, he will govern a deeply divided nation, and he will not have a grace period to heal post-election wounds. That\u2019s because looming deadlines demand that the president barrel straight into a headlock with Congress over budget cuts and tax changes shorthanded by Washington as the \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d That fight has the potential to exacerbate already raw feelings. Senior Democrats say the president\u2019s approach to fiscal cliff negotiations depends on how Republicans react to the election. Some believe an Obama victory will force a self-evaluation by the Republican Party. Obama: My vision for America Obama: I know what real change looks like Gibbs: Obama moving the economy forward Psaki: 'Confident' voters will vote Obama: Romney betting on cynicism \u201cWe have two parties for a reason, and theirs is a very riven party right now,\u201d senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod said. \u201cThere are elements of theirs that will evaluate results to be more ideological, and others will say that would be a mistake. They will have to resolve their own issues.\u201d The following came from interviews with a dozen senior Democrats close to the White House or involved in discussions related to the president\u2019s agenda. Most spoke anonymously because they weren\u2019t comfortable discussing post-election matters without White House approval. Who might serve in Obama\u2019s second term? Fiscal cliff Obama will turn to negotiations over the fiscal cliff quickly after Tuesday, sources close to the president said. In the lead-up to the new year, the nation\u2019s leaders will face three events in quick succession. First, the Bush-era tax cuts will expire on December 31, triggering a return to higher Clinton-era rates unless new policy is set. Second, $1.2 trillion of painful automatic budget cuts will be triggered \u2014 the so-called \u201csequester\u201d \u2013 unless Congress finds an alternate path to bring that sum into the nation\u2019s coffers. Third, the country will hit a new debt ceiling in mid-spring. These events, especially the sequester, could have a devastating impact on the economy, pushing it over the fiscal cliff. Who might serve in Obama\u2019s national security team in his second term \u201cThat\u2019s a cliff no one wants to go over,\u201d Axelrod said. Democrats and Republicans largely agree that the cleanest solution is to effectively address all three crises with a massive reform effort that would both cut government spending and bring in more revenue. It would include changes to the personal tax code, entitlements and debt reduction targets. But, as usual, the devil\u2019s in the details. Candidates mum on fiscal cliff Obama administration officials have told CNN the president will veto any package that extends the Bush-era tax cuts for those making $250,000 a year or more. \u201cI\u2019ve already signed a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of spending cuts. I intend to do more, but if we\u2019re serious about the deficit, we also have to ask the wealthiest Americans to go back to the rates that they paid when Bill Clinton was in office,\u201d the president has said on the trail as recently as Friday. In an e-mailed statement Obama campaign policy director James Kvaal got more specific, explaining that the president wants \u201ca balanced plan that cuts the deficit by $4 trillion with $2.50 worth of spending cuts for every dollar in revenue and reduces spending on Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlements.\u201d If a spirit of compromise grips the capital post-election, the best-case scenario is a framework deal: In November and December the parties agree to general targets for revenue increases and spending cuts plus new tax terms and then work out the details six or nine months down the road. In this rosy scenario, the nation avoids a New Year\u2019s tax hike and the ugly sequester. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, says he thinks it can be done. \u201cWe have a chance in the lame duck to at least start the process, and I think there\u2019s a chance to rally bipartisan support,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are basic issues we can work out, and the president is in a position to do that.\u201d How history will judge Obama Obama, Romney's jobs report spin Ohio Poll: Obama 50%, Romney 47% The rumor mill is whirring with talk of a bipartisan retreat at Camp David \u2013 an idea that was considered and rejected during the never-ending debt negotiations last summer. Not everyone is so sunny. Axelrod: Obama closing argument \u2018from his loins\u2019 Several Democrats say the president has learned from past negotiations with House Republicans and this time will be ready to stand his ground. One top Democrat with close ties to leaders on Capitol Hill and the White House said, \u201cObama\u2019s leverage is he doesn\u2019t have to do anything and everyone\u2019s taxes go up.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a huge forcing mechanism,\u201d one added. And the senior Democrats CNN talked to almost uniformly agreed the president is prepared to allow that increase, which would affect personal income tax, the estate tax, dividends and capital gains taxes. Adding to the potential for a protracted struggle, it\u2019s widely believed that the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts kick in immediately at the start of 2013. However, multiple sources aware of talks said there is plenty of wiggle room and that austerity cuts could be pushed back for months. As a result \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 negotiations could continue before the economy takes a direct hit. Durbin insists that Obama is hoping for the best over the tax cuts and sequester, but he says the president won\u2019t yield on either: \u201cThe president isn\u2019t going to put either gun in the holster until we have this showdown under way,\u201d Durbin said. Romney: My vision for America Immigration reform Comprehensive immigration reform was a pledge Obama made as a candidate and broke as president. Although he took steps to ease restrictions on the children of undocumented workers late in his first term, he once again vowed to turn his attention toward the issue at the beginning of a second term. Placing the blame on Republicans for blocking congressional efforts for reform, Obama told Rolling Stone magazine that the GOP would move on immigration because Republicans will \u201cstart recognizing that alienating the fastest-growing segments of our society is probably not good politics for them. \u201cShould I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated Latinos,\u201d Obama told the Des Moines Register. Durbin, a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act, expressed similar confidence in a future agreement. \u201cRepublican senators have come to me privately saying let\u2019s get this done after the election,\u201d he said. The senior senator said he expects Democrats will propose comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would include work visas and relief for agriculture workers. In a statement emailed to CNN, Kvaal said an Obama immigration plan would \u201cstrengthen enforcement of immigration laws at the border and hold unscrupulous employers accountable. Those here illegally would be required to register and get right with the law, pay taxes and fines, learn English and submit to background checks before they can get in line to apply for a legal status. And it would strengthen our legal immigration system by attracting the best and brightest from around the world, give farmers a legal way to hire workers and reunite families rather than splitting them apart.\u201d Every Democrat interviewed by CNN agreed there would be a move toward a comprehensive plan, but some were less optimistic it would be as far-reaching. \u201cDREAM Act-plus is more likely,\u201d one Democrat suggested. Another senior Democrat expects the president to \u201cgo for comprehensive reform and see whether there are any takers.\u201d In final stretch, campaigns and allies drop $93 million for battlegrounds Working with Congress The president says if he\u2019s re-elected he hopes the Republican Party will change. \u201cI believe that if we\u2019re successful in this election, when we\u2019re successful in this election, that the fever may break,\u201d the president said in June in reference to the GOP. \u201cMy hope, my expectation, is that after the election, now that it turns out that the goal of beating Obama doesn\u2019t make much sense because I\u2019m not running again, then we can start getting some cooperation again.\u201d Axelrod, the president\u2019s long-time adviser, argued that an Obama win could cause a shift in the opposing party: \u201cI\u2019ve always believed there are Republicans who are locked in by the dynamics of their own party and know the American people want them to cooperate where they can. Our goal is to liberate these Republicans of goodwill to see a bright new day and tell the Grover Norquists of the world to take a hike,\u201d Axelrod said. But more Democrats expect the change to come from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue: from the president himself. Asked what the president learned from his first term, a senior Democrat said, \u201cHe\u2019d rather work with them (Republicans) than against them.\u201d But the source wasn\u2019t optimistic, quickly adding, \u201cHe won\u2019t give them two years to jerk him around like he did last time.\u201d That was a sentiment echoed by every Democrat contacted by CNN. One said the president learned from his first term that \u201cbeing president is a continual campaign and can\u2019t separate legislating from the campaign.\u201d CNN Poll of Polls Another argued that Obama will have more success if he builds relationships away from Capitol Hill. \u201cHe will have to find major expressions of trying to bring people together that don\u2019t just involve trying to cut deals with GOP in Congress. At the end of the day they have his number on that. They can assure he\u2019s unsuccessful,\u201d the Democrat argued. It\u2019s not lost on the president. In an interview over the summer, he said if he\u2019s re-elected he hopes to work with Republicans, but if they won\u2019t compromise to his liking, \u201cI\u2019ll work around them.\u201d Some insist Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in particular, is facing a decision point. In 2010 McConnell famously said his party\u2019s top priority was to make Obama a one-term president. This Democrat pointed out McConnell will be up for re-election in 2014 and posed a question. \u201cDoes he want to go into his re-election cycle as obstructionist in chief? That will be a big choice he\u2019ll have to make.\u201d However, McConnell represents Kentucky, a consistently Republican state that most recently sent tea party advocate Rand Paul to the Senate. Battling the leader of the Democratic Party could be good politics for the senior Republican senator. Campaign explorer The rest The other bites at the apple could include corporate tax reform and the use of executive authority to promote a clean energy agenda. Given the current politics, realistic Democrats say the most the president is likely to get on energy legislation is a reauthorization of the administration\u2019s clean energy tax credits. There is not much political will to promote spending on infrastructure, though the president often discusses putting construction workers back to work. There are ways he can front-load spending on infrastructure investment already in the pipeline, but beyond this his opportunities seem limited. After about 18 months, the nation\u2019s capitol will turn to the midterm elections and members of Congress who are up for re-election. This is typically when a second-term president focuses a great deal on the other side of his portfolio: traveling the world as a solo actor, commander-in-chief. Despite the challenges, senior White House adviser David Plouffe sounded optimistic about the state of play past November 7. \u201cCampaigns are tough. Folks in Congress, people understand campaigns are tough. We\u2019ve got big challenges,\u201d Plouffe said. \u201cWhen that\u2019s over people will dust themselves off and attention will appropriately turn to that away from politics.\u201d Are you voting?",

Barack Obama and Mitt Romney made extraordinary efforts to court the Latino vote, which included their participation at a forum organized by a Spanish-speaking television network that allowed the two to speak directly to the fastest-growing voting bloc. Even as polls show Latinos care about the same issues as the rest of the nation and say the economy, jobs, education and health care are their top concerns, immigration has been the topic that grabs headlines and one the candidates have focused on to reach Hispanics. Do the math: CNN\u2019s voting bloc calculator Obama tried to redeem himself for failing to deliver on his 2008 promise to enact comprehensive immigration reform within a year of his election by granting administrative relief to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the United States illegally.  Romney tried to look tough on immigration during the primary season but since has said he would not suspend the relief action and would work on an immigration reform, if elected. Photos: From the campaign trail Colorado immigrant casts his first vote Jorge Ramos: Latinos prefer Obama Obama betting on the Latino vote Here are five things about the Latino vote to watch on Election Day: 1. Voter turnout The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials estimates that 12.2 million Hispanics will vote this year. Most are in states like California, Texas, or New York, where they are not likely to make a difference in the outcome of the presidential race because those are not battlegrounds. The Latino vote, however, in Florida will be crucial to determining the winner of that swing state. First, turnout is projected to be 34.5% higher than in 2008 and second, the state seems to be changing from a reliable Republican enclave in the southern part of the state, led by the Cuban-American community, to a more Democratic-inclined group in the center of the state along the Orlando-Tampa corridor, led by Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics. Latinos are also being courted in other states \u2013 including battleground Virginia and North Carolina, states that voted for Obama last time by small margins and showed big increases in Latino population, according to the 2010 Census. In Nevada and Colorado, Hispanics already have clout and turnout will make a difference. Even in the most fiercely fought battleground state of Ohio, the candidates are running ads in Spanish and have ground games in place to encourage Latinos to vote. The Pew Center found that 166,000 of the more than 355,000 Latinos living in Ohio are registered to vote. Latino vote may top 12 million in 2012 2. Florida\u2019s Cuban vs. Cuban race The Republican monopoly on the Cuban-American community could be broken in the race for the 26th Congressional District. Incumbent David Rivera is facing Democratic challenger Joe Garcia in a repeat race from two years ago. But the Miami Herald reports that Rivera is behind in the polls because of an FBI investigation into allegations he funneled money to one of Garcia\u2019s opponents in the primary. A Garcia victory would most likely reflect changes to the district \u2013 which now stretches to the more politically moderate Keys and skipping the western tip of South Florida that is traditionally more conservative \u2013 than any ideological shift among the Cuban-American community. A recent Herald poll showed more than 76% of Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County favored Mitt Romney. Opinion: Why I vote, and you should too 3. Texas and California historic races After a lengthy and bitter partisan fight to draw four new congressional districts to favor Latino candidates and reflect the increase of that group\u2019s population, only the 34th District in Texas along the Mexican border and the Gulf of Mexico has two Hispanic candidates: Democrat Filemon Vela and Republican Jessica Puente Bradshaw. But the Hispanic representation in the U.S. House is not likely to increase since longtime El Paso representative, Silvestre Reyes, lost the Democratic primary in the 16th District to Robert O\u2019Rourke, who gave himself the Latino sounding nickname \u201cBeto.\u201d Republican Barbara Carrasco is the challenger in that race but her chances of winning are, like Puente Bradshaw\u2019s, dim since both areas lean Democratic. An upset in either race would mean the  first Latina congresswoman from Texas. Another notable candidate is Joaquin Castro, who is in line to replace retiring Rep. Charlie Gonzalez in a safely Democratic district. Joaquin is the twin brother of Julian Castro, who gained national fame as keynote speaker of the Democratic National Convention. The brightest spot for Hispanics in the Lone Star State is Republican Ted Cruz, who is poised to become the first Latino senator from Texas In California, Dr. Raul Ruiz and former astronaut Juan Hernandez are trying to unseat incumbent Republicans while Juan Vargas is poised to replace Rep. Bob Filner, who is running for Mayor of San Diego. If Obama wins\u2026 4. Maryland\u2019s DREAM Act Last year the Maryland Legislature approved a bill granting in-state tuition to students who are in the country illegally, a measure signed by Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. But the bill was quickly challenged and opponents gathered enough signatures to force the issue onto a referendum which will be decided Tuesday. A few states, including Texas and California, have similar laws but this is the first time voters get to decide the issue. If Romney wins\u2026 5. Has Sheriff Joe met his match? \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff\u201d is seeking a sixth term in Maricopa County, Arizona. Joe Arpaio faces voters amid a series of accusations of corruption and federal investigations prompted by his stance against illegal immigration. Latinos in Arizona are fiercely campaigning for his defeat. Opinion: What\u2019s really at stake in election 2012",

Not in the current climate -- though maybe eventually Ever have the feeling you\u2019re being lied to by the news media, the authorities, the corporate world? That somebody \u2013 or something \u2013 is out to get you? You\u2019re not alone. Welcome to 21st-century America. Look around. Trust is hitting historic lows. Just a third of Americans have a favorable view of the federal government, a decline of 31% since 2002, according to the Pew Center for People and the Press. Gallup has Congress\u2019 approval rating is in the low 20s, after nearing single digits last summer. And the news media aren\u2019t much better off. \u201cNegative opinions about the performance of news organizations now equal or surpass all-time highs on nine of 12 core measures the Pew Research Center has been tracking since 1985,\u201d a Pew report said. Add in our wired, social media-addicted world, and rumors reign. You\u2019ve heard them all, whether they involve the presidential candidates, global climate change or illegal immigration. They\u2019re our little open secrets. They give us the sense that we\u2019re on to Them. Opinion: What\u2019s really at stake in election 2012 \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be suspicious,\u201d says Geoffrey Vaughan, a political science professor at Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cThere is something attractive in thinking that you know something, that you haven\u2019t bought into the mass public opinion.\u201d That attitude is nothing new. In a famous 1964 essay, \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics,\u201d historian Richard Hofstadter traced what he called \u201cthe paranoid style\u201d through American history. What he found was that a fearful strain of mistrust flows through the blood of the republic, whether it was 18th-century religious leaders worried about the Illuminati, politicians suspicious of immigrants or McCarthyites convinced of Communist infiltration. Hollywood has dined out on these feelings for years: \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate,\u201d \u201cThe Parallax View,\u201d \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d the TV series \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d even the James Coburn comedy \u201cThe President\u2019s Analyst\u201d \u2013 all are based on the idea that  some kind of secret, malevolent operation is going on behind the curtain. It\u2019s as American as apple pie \u2013 filled with razor blades. Sure, like the stories about those razor blade-tainted apples, there are sometimes bits of truth within. More often, however, the truth is overwhelmed by panic and hyperbole. Which is a problem, because fear and mistrust have real-life implications, especially in an election year like this one, where it has seeped into the body politic like acid. To 17% of Americans, President Obama is a Muslim \u2013 and 65% of that group are \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with that.   It\u2019s not enough for many opponents to disagree with the president on the issues; he has been characterized as a socialist and even the Antichrist. Mitt Romney\u2019s had his own problems. During the Republican primaries, he struggled to attract evangelical voters who considered his Mormonism a \u201ccult.\u201d  (It wasn\u2019t until mid-October that the Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s organization decided to remove that designation from its website.) This election year, in fact, has been one for the books. Facts, apparently, don\u2019t matter anymore. Both campaigns have earned \u201cpants-on-fire\u201d ratings from the fact-checking site Politifact; both sides have blithely ignored them and moved forward. After the Romney campaign was called out for some falsehoods, pollster Neil Newhouse responded, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.\u201d Worse are the actual laws on the books based on some kind of perceived threat. Oklahoma banned courts from considering Islam\u2019s Sharia law. (Oklahoma\u2019s law has been temporarily blocked.) The Texas state Republican Party even created a platform opposing \u201ccritical thinking\u201d in state schools, though a spokesperson was quick to point out that the platform regards \u201ccritical thinking\u201d as another name for \u201coutcome-based education\u201d (which the platform criticizes as having \u201cthe purpose of challenging the student\u2019s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority\u201d). Paranoia isn\u2019t on the fringe anymore, like it was in Hofstadter\u2019s day. It\u2019s now closer to the beating heart of the mainstream. \u201cThe fringe has begun to blur with the base,\u201d says John Avlon, author of \u201cWingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America.\u201d As the title of Avlon\u2019s book indicates, he\u2019s concerned about this. \u201cThat\u2019s the key dynamic, and that\u2019s the key danger.\u201d The bogeymen of a new generation Avlon, a former speechwriter for New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and a contributor to the Daily Beast and CNN, observes that one reason Hofstadter\u2019s essay remains valuable is that it shows that in \u201cevery generation, there are enthusiastic dupes who are getting sold the same old snake oil.\u201d In Hofstadter\u2019s time, the ultra-right John Birch Society received attention for its claims of communist conspiracies and elitist cabals. In our time, says Avlon, conservative talk show hosts give voice to these claims. \u201cThese are dog-whistle echoes of very old arguments \u2013 arguments that have been thoroughly discredited by history.\u201d It\u2019s not just right-wingers who engage in this talk, he adds. During the George W. Bush administration, some commentators on the left were afflicted with what Avlon, borrowing a term from columnist Charles Krauthammer, calls \u201cBush Derangement Syndrome.\u201d Left-wing opponents of the president called for his impeachment and compared him to Hitler. Regardless of who sponsors them, these arguments keep following us. Almost 50 years ago, Hofstadter chronicled a handful of overlapping paranoid fears \u2013 the belief in an elite conspiracy that wants to run the world, the concern that immigrants and members of other religions will displace \u201creal\u201d Americans, and the idea that a fifth column is working to bring down the United States from within. Those fears continue to emerge today. It\u2019s no wonder there are calls to \u201ctake our country back,\u201d with the implication that \u201cback\u201d was a golden age before the world went to hell. Yesterday\u2019s paranoid types feared elite groups such as the Illuminati and the Masons. Today\u2019s bogeymen include the members of the Rockefeller-founded Trilateral Commission and the politicians and financiers who attend the monied confab at Bohemian Grove and are suspected of mapping out the \u201cnew world order.\u201d Or consider immigration. In the 1850s, the nativist American Party (also known as the Know-Nothings) formed over fear of the new immigrants \u2013 Irish and German \u2013 coming to the United States, allegedly stealing jobs. Today, there\u2019s Arizona SB 1070, nicknamed the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law. Though parts of the law were shot down by the U.S. Supreme Court, other states have used it as a model, and immigrant suspicion is routinely in play \u2013 especially along the southern border.  This despite studies that have shown that immigrants don\u2019t take jobs away from U.S. citizens. Even suspicion of an internal coup remains. In the 1950s, we had the Red Scare; today there are people claiming the coming of Sharia law; rumors about Agenda 21, a United Nations development initiative that has inspired fears of world government; and the always reliable anti-Semitism, whether it concerns the \u201cZionist media,\u201d blame for 9/11 or a belief that Israel is pulling the strings of the U.S. government. For Hofstadter, the \u201cParanoid Style\u201d was an extension of two decades of work  that promoted reason over emotion and critiqued America\u2019s fondness for an idealized, agrarian past, says his biographer, Elizabethtown College history professor David S. Brown. By the time he wrote the essay, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner was convinced that all those pesky extremists were a thing of the past. But he was well aware that consensus was fragile. These are dog-whistle echoes of very old arguments \u2013 arguments that have been thoroughly discredited by history. \"Wingnuts\" author John Avlon As Derek Arnold, a Villanova communications professor, observes:  \u201cYou can almost see him as pretty prescient.\u201d \u2018Leaving rationality behind\u2019 It\u2019s certainly easy to fall under the spell of paranoia. Since the dawn of mankind, we have been clannish and tribal animals, wary of others, fused by emotional connections. In the modern world we create tribes beyond blood \u2013 like sports fans or, well, political parties. The danger is that many people don\u2019t develop the rationality to tamp down the emotion, says Dr. David Reiss, a San Diego-based psychiatrist who studies personality dynamics. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that they\u2019re paranoid in a clinical sense, but if they feel their needs are going to be met \u2013 or they\u2019re connecting with someone powerful \u2013 they\u2019re basically leaving rationality behind,\u201d he says. Then there\u2019s another deeply human element: the attraction of the story. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that\u2019s interesting and grabs your attention, regardless of your background, it\u2019s appealing,\u201d says Villanova\u2019s Arnold. He mentions the theories about the Mayan calendar predicting catastrophe. \u201cLook at the end-of-the-world stories we\u2019ve been getting this year.\u201d Though much of the focus these days is on right-wing paranoia, both sides, as they get more extreme, look at their opposition as the enemy and hold on more tightly to their own beliefs, says Jonathan Haidt, a professor of moral psychology at NYU and the author of the recently published \u201cThe Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.\u201d \u201cExtremism on either side leads to very predictable patterns of thinking and usage of fact,\u201d he says. \u201cMorality binds and blinds. As long as you\u2019re on a team, you\u2019ll have your own set of values and facts.\u201d Extremists on both sides often take leaps beyond the logical. They indulge in hyperbole: for the left, the right is engaged in a \u201cwar on women\u201d; the right has talked about the left waging a \u201cwar on religion.\u201d (After the massacre in Aurora, Colorado, Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert attributed the tragedy to \u201congoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.\u201d) Why don\u2019t believers follow logic? Again, the mind\u2019s fascination with patterns and groupings is to blame, says Assumption\u2019s Vaughn: We use shortcuts to make decisions, often dictated by our biases. Add to that our tribal instincts, and shades of gray are reduced to a black-and-white world. \u201cIt\u2019s something you can understand,\u201d he says. Those who don\u2019t see things the same way, he continues, are the deluded ones. Cashing in Minnesota  Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat and one of only two Muslims in Congress, has seen plenty of fear-mongering, whether it\u2019s accusations that up to 81 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are communists or that Huma Abedin, a Hillary Clinton aide, has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. He believes the accusations are tied to both demagoguery and paranoia \u2013 \u201cthere are people who have an appetite for conspiracy\u201d \u2013 but undergirding it is something even more elemental in politics: money. \u201cIt is lucrative,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as there is a financial payoff, and it also happens to feed their paranoia and thirst for conspiracy, it\u2019s going to keep going \u2013 until the American people just totally reject it.\u201d Avlon, the \u201cWingnuts\u201d author, agrees. \u201cPeople who listen to partisan media don\u2019t appreciate that what they have taken to be a tribe of true believers is nothing more than a business plan,\u201d he says. Indeed, there is good money in playing to your audience. the more the audience buys into it, the harder it is to dislodge their beliefs. Writer Charles P. Pierce laid out the rules in his indispensable book \u201cIdiot America\u201d: \u201c1. Any theory is valid if it sells books, soaks up ratings or otherwise moves units. 2. Anything can be true if someone says it loudly enough. 3. Fact is that which enough people believe (and) Truth is determined by how fervently you believe it.\u201d No wonder the so-called mainstream media has trust issues. In the search for ratings and Internet traffic, it gives voice to the same fearful hyperbole found elsewhere in society \u2013 and often plays it for entertainment value. (Witness the rise of Donald Trump, political pundit and almost-candidate, whose regular proclamations headline the New York tabloids and are then repeated throughout cable news.) It\u2019s the classic case of preying on our insecurities, points out Ari Kohen, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska. \u201cLike those teases for the 10 o\u2019clock news: \u2018What household product might be making you sick? Tune in at 10!\u2019 It\u2019s the same idea,\u201d he says. Throw in the echo chamber of right- and left-wing websites, and these claims are even harder to escape, particularly in what\u2019s been described as \u201cthe post-truth era.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if everybody\u2019s creating his or her own reality at this point,\u201d says John Carroll, a Boston University communications professor and regular media commentator. \u201cThey can essentially construct an information environment that\u2019s so self-reinforcing, and so exclusionary, that they don\u2019t really have to consider any evidence that contradicts what they already believe.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re in the danger zone\u2019 American history has not been kind to the conspiracists. In general it has fought off their claims, laughed at their theories. But there have been times when the suspicious have had a point. As the old saying goes, just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you. After all, the Soviet Union did infiltrate some U.S. agencies, and Julius Rosenberg really did deliver classified information. The CIA was instrumental in a number of coups. The FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO program spied on domestic groups. Watergate revealed a tangle of Nixonian malfeasance. A handful of climate scientists did try to clamp down on dissent. (Their opponents have also worked together.) Finance industry workers did cover up bad loans and, more recently, fix the LIBOR rate. All are \u201cclear evidence,\u201d says Fordham University professor Bruce Andrews, who has taught courses on conspiracies and covert activity, \u201cof actual organized groups doing things.\u201d The dark currents can give a person pause. \u201cOne of the reasons conspiracy theories have proliferated over the last half century is that they have so often been proven correct,\u201d says Assumption\u2019s Vaughan. It may never hurt to have a healthy dose of skepticism. But, a willingness to accept \u2013 or immerse oneself in \u2013 mistrust has been shown to weaken civic structure in other cultures. Russia and some countries in the Middle East have suffered from a lack of transparency, along with great divides between the haves and have-nots. Those cultures also have long histories of conspiracy-mongering and little trust in their governments. The United States was intended to be different. It\u2019s almost as if everybody\u2019s creating his or her own reality at this point. John Carroll, Boston University professor \u201cAmerica\u2019s ability to question and, if necessary, change our government made such (conspiracy-minded) thoughts here against the grain,\u201d says Villanova\u2019s Arnold. Despite our weakened faith in government and institutions, the country chugs along. But what of the future? \u201cI wish I could be optimistic, but I really can\u2019t,\u201d says Reiss, the San Diego psychiatrist. \u201cThere\u2019s so much power behind making things destructive. It\u2019s really in the service and to the advantage of the politicians on both sides to keep people in a somewhat scared state.\u201d \u201c(Consensus) is not dead, but we\u2019re in the danger zone,\u201d says Avlon. \u201cThere are real costs to hyperpartisanship. Most importantly it becomes ultimately a threat to self-governance \u2013 it\u2019s stopping us from being able to solve the serious problems we face.\u201d \u201cRighteous Mind\u201d author Haidt, however, sees a reason for hope \u2013 though not immediately. We\u2019re stuck for probably the next five years, he says. After that, events could intercede. We could face economic collapse; we could have total victory by one party. But the most intriguing, he observes, is the passage of generations. \u201cWe went from the Greatest Generation, which was the most civic-minded because they fought World War II together \u2026 to the baby boomers, who were the worst at working together because their foundational experience was splitting apart to fight the left-right battle,\u201d says Haidt. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon be moving on to the millennial generation, which is marked by a reluctance to make moral judgments.\u201d That has its own drawbacks, he adds, \u201cbut some tolerance and reluctance to judge might be just what we need in the 2020s.\u201d Until then, however, there will be no golden age of understanding, no rebirth of trust. No, for now, we\u2019re stuck with the system we have, the noise it creates, and the voices in our heads. Margin of error: Two candidates, two journeys, one race of lost dreams",

            "article_content": "Candidates have spent little time talking about climate change, gun control, immigration The recent storm has put climate change in the spotlight Still, campaigns focus on issues that they believe will get them votes That has largely been the economy Superstorm Sandy\u2019s ability to wreak havoc on the most populated parts of the country this week has pointed out a noticeable gap in the 2012 presidential election \u2013 how little the candidates have focused on climate change, the environment and other under-covered issues. \u201cWith flooding in NYC and 3 feet of snow in W VA, isn\u2019t it time for candidates to address climate change and extreme weather,\u201d tweeted Darrell West, a director at the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank. Mike Tidwell of The Nation, a left-leaning magazine, was more direct. \u201cThe presidential candidates decided not to speak about climate change, but climate change has decided to speak to them.\u201d NJ Governor: Sandy impact \u2018terrifying\u2019 The reason for this omission is simple: the 2012 presidential election has had a laser-like focus on a small handful of issues \u2013 namely the economy. Meanwhile, other issues \u2013 immigration, gun control, the environment and climate change \u2013 have simply failed to break through among the candidates and in the media. The last time both candidates mentioned climate change in any substantive manner was in written statements to a science organization in September. In interviews posted on Sciencedebate.org, President Barack Obama called climate change \u201cone of the biggest issues of this generation\u201d and Republican challenger Mitt Romney said, \u201cmy best assessment of the data is that the world is getting warmer\u201d and \u201cthat many human activity contributes to that warming.\u201d How Romney, Obama adjust to storm Romney: Storm will be a 'difficult time' Presidential politics and the storm In what has been a breathless campaign, though, it is fair to say that throughout most of the campaign, both Obama and Romney have remained fairly mum about how they would deal with climate change. Both candidates have mentioned renewable energy, but the issue of a warming planet has remained on the back burner. But climate change is far from the only issue that has received little to no attention. The eurozone crisis and its affect on the United States, the continued collapse of Mexico and \u2013 following the deadly attack at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, this summer \u2013 gun control laws in the United States have all received little to no attention. Courting a certain demographic The primary reason a candidate includes an issue in his stump speech largely hinges on the kind of voter the candidate is trying to reach, according to Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and former aide to President Bill Clinton. \u201cPoliticians want to get votes. To do that you have to: a) talk about issues that matter to voters, and b) talk about issues you disagree with your opponent on,\u201d Begala said. \u201cObviously a lot of important issues get left out.\u201d And when those issues get left out, their importance seems secondary because no one is talking about them. Looking presidential: The optics of presidential leadership \u201cThose (other) issues really are ancillary to what\u2019s on the mind of the American people right now,\u201d said Erick Erickson, editor-in-chief of the conservative RedState.com and a CNN contributor. \u201cThe American people are much more concerned with the economy and jobs. Were the candidates to focus on these other issues, they\u2019d be accused of ignoring the big issue.\u201d A Pew Research Center poll from October showed why the campaigns remain focused on the economy. When asked how important the candidate\u2019s position on unemployment would be, 91% of men and 89% of women said it would be extremely or very important. Another Pew survey, however, showed global warming and immigration were at the bottom of a list of more than 20 issues. And polls from NBC News and NPR did not even list those issues among the top 10. The deficit, terrorism and foreign policy all rated higher. Drawing comparisonsBut there are other reasons why those issues are often ignored. Campaigns like to draw comparisons with their competition \u2013 division lines that make it easy for the voters to differentiate between the two candidates on Election Day. That is why, according to Erickson, Obama and Romney have remained mum on certain issues. Romney on storm aftermath: \u2018People are hurting this morning\u2019 Why, he says, would Romney talk about abortion when he already has the pro-life community locked down? Likewise, why would Obama talk about gay marriage when an \u201coverwhelming majority of people who are for the issue are already with the president.\u201d \u201cFor the GOP, the election has centered on the economy, which has been the big issue Romney has had to litigate, so to speak, to persuade independents,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cAt the same time, the president has focused on women\u2019s reproductive rights to try to keep women in his camp. Both sides have focused on the issues they felt they needed to and sometimes the other issues necessarily get crowded out.\u201d And activists and leaders in those issues groups have felt that crowding out. David Yarnold, CEO of the National Audubon Society, says he is \u201cupset\u201d that other issues have been ignored. \u201cI think the extremes on both sides have made that conversation almost impossible and in an election where the economy is front and center, it is hard for any other issue to break through,\u201d said Yarnold. \u201cIt is really unfortunate. It is yet another example where Americans are out ahead of their leaders.\u201d But the lack of a climate change conversation has also compelled action from the Audubon Society. The group has partnered with ConservAmerica, a conservative conservation group, to try and take the politics out of conservation and climate change. \u201cWe want to take the issue back,\u201d said Yarnold. \u201cIt is not left, it is not right, it is not center.\u201d Obama updated on Sandy through the night; praised by Christie If most stump speeches are attempts to court votes, the best way to reach a lot of voters is through media coverage. The media has the ability to validate candidates by talking about the issues the campaigns are pushing, while holding candidates accountable to issues they don\u2019t want to address. \u201cThe media has a crucial role in trying to get the candidates to talk about important issues they might otherwise want to dodge,\u201d Begala said. But the media can only do so much. \u201cNeither Obama nor Romney has any plans for new gun control laws,\u201d Begala said. \u201cSo no matter how hard the media or interest groups try, gun control just isn\u2019t going to be a big issue in the campaign.\u201d This is normal Though the issues vary year-to-year, most presidential elections center on a few big issues. When then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton faced off with President George H.W. Bush in 1992, the main issue of the race was the economy. Bush had alienated much of his conservative base by promising to not raise taxes and then doing exactly that. Clinton ran on the idea that he could pull the economy out of a recession. Moreover, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Bush\u2019s strong suit \u2013 foreign policy \u2013 was seen as an ancillary issue. \u201cIn the history of elections in this country at the national level, it is very normal for there to just be a few issues discusses,\u201d Erickson said.  \u201cWhen there are no crises or major issues on the world stage, the economy becomes the big issue. How candidates talk about other issues depends on how they can tie those issues into the big thematic, overarching issue of the campaign.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama accuses Republican challenger of having \"Romnesia\" Mitt Romney won first debate then adopted conciliatory, more centrist tone Romney emerges from debate season having tightened state and national polls President Barack Obama is accusing Republican Mitt Romney of changing his promises and policies so thoroughly that he\u2019s dubs it \u201cRomnesia,\u201d but the U.S. election campaign has itself changed dramatically and Obama is scrambling to recover. \u201cAttacking me is not an agenda,\u201d Romney said this week, during the third and final presidential debate ahead of the November 6 vote. The most dramatic change in the race is the crucial one: with less than two weeks to go, Romney is leading or tied with Obama in national public opinion polls, after having trailed him for months. Map: World weighs in on U.S. election A closer look reveals a more complicated picture, but it isn\u2019t entirely comforting to Obama either. America\u2019s presidential election results are actually tallied state-by-state, rather than nationally.  As a result, individual states and the votes they are allotted in America\u2019s quirky presidential Electoral College are really the focus of the contest. Photos: From the campaign trail King: What could ruin Romney's night Obama jokes around while voting This week the polls put Obama well ahead in Ohio, perhaps the most important state that is still undecided. But CNN\u2019s own estimates suggest that Romney is slightly ahead in North Carolina and well ahead in Indiana and Missouri, three others among the handful of \u201cswing\u201d states. Video: Mann explains \u201cswing\u201d states Mindful of how much is still in motion, Obama is pouring his campaign a whole lot of caffeine with what he called \u201ca 48-hour fly-around campaign-marathon extravaganza.\u201d By CNN\u2019s estimate, he was slated to travel roughly 10,000 kilometers in two days this week, on a coast-to-coast odyssey aboard Air Force One stopping in eight states. There has also been a change on Romney\u2019s side and it\u2019s apparently taken the president by surprise. The series of gaffes that punctuated his campaign for weeks has apparently ended, and the Republican candidate has been widely seen as articulate and convincing in addressing the largest audiences he\u2019s ever had \u2013 the millions of television viewers who tuned in for his three debates with Obama. After his confident and commanding posture in the first debate and the dramatic gains in public opinion polls that followed, Romney shifted into a much more comforting and conciliatory figure in this week\u2019s encounter with Obama. He said he agreed with the president on several issues and described his own policies in ways that seem calculated to widen their appeal beyond traditional Republican voters. Romney denied any plans, for example, to cut taxes for the wealthy or risk involving the U.S. military in conflicts overseas, even in nations such as Syria and Iran, where he has long accused the president of indecisiveness and inaction. Obama found himself criticizing policies that Romney says he never proposed. \u201cHe is changing up so much, back-tracking and sidestepping,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have got to name this condition he is going through. I think it is called Romnesia.\u201d Since he first started running for president ahead of the 2008 election, Obama himself has changed policies or abandoned promises as well, on subjects ranging from closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay to pressing for wide-ranging reform of America\u2019s immigration laws. (He hasn\u2019t done either). Politicians tend to behave in predictable ways and shifting position is often one of them. The thing that Romney really has changed, above all, is the likelihood that Obama will be re-elected. President Obama has less than two weeks to work on changing that.",

            "article_content": "Third-party candidates could impact close races in swing states CNN's polling director says there is no statistical impact so far Conservative Virgil Goode could siphon votes from Mitt Romney in Virginia Libertarian Gary Johnson's campaign says it attracts Republicans and Democrats Gary Johnson and Virgil Goode have no chance of winning the November 6 presidential election, but the two \u201cthird-party\u201d candidates could have an impact on who does. Together, Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Goode of the Constitution Party are in position to siphon a few thousand votes from Republican Mitt Romney and perhaps President Barack Obama in some of the handful of battleground states considered up for grabs and therefore decisive in determining the winner. Goode, a former Democrat-turned-Republican congressman from Virginia known for an anti-immigration stance and other strongly conservative policies, routinely won well over 120,000 votes in his home district in elections from 1996 to 2008. If he gets only 10% of that support this time, it could be enough to swing what is currently considered a dead-even race for Virginia\u2019s 13 electoral votes to Obama. Gary Johnson could be a spoiler Gary Johnson: An uphill battle to catch a wave, win the presidency Gary Johnson: A presidential spoiler? \u201cVirgil Goode is a wild card, particularly in Virginia,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, adding \u201che could be a factor even if he wins only a handful of votes.\u201d A similar scenario involves Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, in other states considered too close to call like Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire, said Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University. All three states, with a combined 19 electoral votes, are known for independent-minded voters, she noted, enough of whom might be inclined to back a Libertarian instead of Romney. In Nevada, a CNN/ORC International poll last month showed Goode winning 4% support and Johnson 3%, with Obama holding a 47%-44% lead over Romney in the state. Based on 2008 turnout in Nevada, the support for Goode and Johnson would amount to about 67,000 votes. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed the impact of third-party candidates earlier this month, telling CNN that Johnson\u2019s candidacy was \u201calmost a non-factor.\u201d Could Obama\u2019s struggles with white voters cost him the election? Voters \u201care not going to throw their vote away when we have an election here that\u2019s about the future of America,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d CNN polling shows that support for Obama and Romney changes little when third party candidates are factored into state races, said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \u201cIn all states CNN has polled so far, the minor party candidates are getting no more than 4% of the vote, and usually closer to 1%-2%,\u201d Holland said, noting that including them doesn\u2019t change the margin between Obama and Romney. \u201cStatistically speaking, it\u2019s difficult to make the case that the minor party candidates are affecting the race.\u201d The influence of third party challengers has dropped dramatically since Texas billionaire Ross Perot won almost 19% of the vote in 1992, drawing conservative ire for harming incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush\u2019s re-election chances against Democrat Bill Clinton. Eight years later, consumer activist and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader got 2.8 million votes, including more than 94,000 in Florida that ensured Democratic Vice President Al Gore\u2019s loss to Republican George W. Bush in the state by 537 votes. Despite plummeting votes for third party candidates in recent elections, the tight race this year between Obama and Romney makes even fractional support for others potentially decisive in a key state, and therefore the election. Who\u2019s up? Check out: CNN Polling Center \u201cIf the race is close enough, 100 votes can matter,\u201d said Scott Rasmussen, president of the polling company Rasmussen Reports. The fierce competition of this year\u2019s race means fewer undecided voters and fewer people choosing a third-party option, he noted, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not a Ross Perot year.\u201d Goode rejects any insinuation that he seeks to play a spoiler role, saying his policies would be better for the country than those of Obama or Romney. If he managed to win, \u201cit would shake up Washington in that an average citizen would be president instead of someone that is backed by super-PACs,\u201d he recently told CNN. Johnson depicts himself as more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal issues. He says same-sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal, supports legalizing marijuana usage, and also says he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service. To Schiller, Johnson represents a possible threat that should worry the Romney campaign. \u201cI think you can argue that Gary Johnson will siphon off Romney votes,\u201d she told CNN, arguing that hardcore conservatives who consider the former Massachusetts governor to be too moderate could opt for the Libertarian. Do the math: CNN Electoral Map \u201cIf Colorado gets closer, I think it will matter if Johnson\u2019s in the race,\u201d Schiller said, noting that \u201c1,000 or 2,000 votes from Romney \u2013 it makes a difference.\u201d To counter that dynamic, Romney\u2019s campaign must make the argument that a vote for Johnson is the same as voting for Obama, according to Schiller. \u201cAny time you have a third party in a very tight race and that third party candidate seems a lot more like Romney than he does Obama, then if you\u2019re Romney, you have to discredit that candidate,\u201d she said. However, Johnson\u2019s campaign told CNN in September that some of the candidate\u2019s support came from former Obama supporters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. By running as the Libertarian Party candidate, Johnson hoped to gain the support of the relatively small but fiercely loyal following of Ron Paul, the Texas congressman who has failed in three bids to win the Republican presidential nomination. So far, the polling suggests little progress by Johnson in winning over Paul\u2019s supporters. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey earlier this month in Virginia showed 1% of likely voters \u2013 about 38,000 based on the 2008 turnout in the state \u2013 supported an unspecified candidate other than Obama or Romney. The bulk of that support appeared to be from strongly liberal or moderate younger voters, a demographic closer to Obama\u2019s base. Obama could get hurt by two other minor party candidates \u2013 Jill Stein of the Green Party and Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party \u2013 but both are considered far less likely to get enough support to undermine the president. A CNN/ORC national poll at the end of September showed Stein with 3% compared to 4% for Johnson, while Goode and Anderson had negligible support. However, Stein failed to register in CNN/ORC polls in recent weeks in Florida and Nevada, and she got 1% support in Ohio compared to 3% for Johnson. According to Schiller, possible voter apathy by liberals disappointed with Obama\u2019s first term helped motivate the president\u2019s campaign to mount a huge effort to boost turnout both in early voting and on Election Day. \u201cI think they understood they had to get the people who would definitely vote for Obama to the polls, period, with no wavering and no indecision,\u201d she said. CNN\u2019s Holland warned against assuming supporters of third party candidates changed their mind from a major party contender. \u201cMinor party supporters usually fall into that category because they don\u2019t like the two major party candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in a hypothetical world in which the race were only between the two major party candidates, a lot of minor party voters would have just stayed at home.\u201d The other candidates, the other debate CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's rise in the polls tied to his good first debate against President Barack Obama Polls indicate Obama won the next two debates, but the impact on the race is unclear Romney used the presidential debates to shift to the political center The Republican adopted more conservative stances to win the GOP nomination Mitt Romney waited until the presidential debates in the final five weeks of the election campaign to make his long-anticipated shift to the political center after previously espousing strongly conservative stances to win the Republican nomination. The move appeared to catch President Barack Obama by surprise at their first face-to-face match up. His lackluster performance against a strong showing by Romney helped the former Massachusetts governor to catch, and in some places, pass the president in the polls. Obama then fought back. He won the last two debates in the eyes of analysts and viewers with aggressive challenges to Romney\u2019s changing positions, framed by the president as a question of whether voters can trust his rival. And some people say debates don\u2019t matter. CNN Poll: Nearly half of debate watchers say Obama won showdown The roller-coaster ride of the 2012 campaign has been particularly volatile because of an unprecedented number of debates. There were more than 20 in the GOP primary campaign followed by the three presidential showdowns and one between the vice presidential contenders. Portman on debate, Afghan withdrawal Kerry: What does Romney stand for? Coleman: Romney 'clearly won the debate' Will last debate change voters minds? How much do Romney and Obama agree on? The multiple 90-minute sessions were almost all broadcast nationally on network or cable television. Voters were able to see an array of presidential hopefuls deal with the unique campaign pressure-cooker of differing styles, settings, moderators, audiences and issues \u2013 all under the bright glare of stage lights and intense public scrutiny. Debate\u2019s agreement-fest makes it tough for undecideds to choose In the end, the debates likely did as much or more to shape public perceptions of the two final contenders than the billions of dollars spent on mostly negative advertising that have filled the airwaves nationally, particularly in the handful of battleground states still up for grabs and therefore crucial to winning the White House on November 6. For Romney, the debates presented the last chance to fully introduce himself to a nationwide audience, and he waited until the first encounter in Denver on October 3 to make his strongest pitch for independent and moderate voters considered key to winning the election. Romney could have started the shift a month earlier at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, but instead used his acceptance speech to focus on his personal qualities as a husband, father, local and regional Mormon church leader and successful businessman. Rich Galen, a conservative commentator who formerly worked for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, last week described a patient Romney strategy. The campaign waited until the home stretch to unveil a long-expected shift toward the middle by the candidate, who described himself as \u201cseverely conservative\u201d during the primaries to try to appeal to the conservative base. \u201cThey hold their fire, hold their fire, hold their fire, and then they sprint to the finish,\u201d Galen said, referring to what he called a \u201cchange in what he\u2019s saying and how he\u2019s saying it.\u201d The shift \u201ctells me that they had planned for a late-game surge,\u201d he said. It appeared to work, with Romney\u2019s assertive debate performance in Denver providing traditionally Republican voters who questioned his presidential credentials with the validation they needed to support him. Romney repeatedly invoked what he called the consequences of Obama\u2019s failed policies \u2013 high unemployment, sluggish economic recovery, an onerous regulatory system that stifled growth \u2013 with little challenge from the president. Readers respond: 5 things you learned from the final debate He insisted his tax reforms to cut rates across the board and eliminate unspecified deductions would not increase the deficit, rejecting Obama\u2019s claim that it would. At the same time, Romney also touted the health care reforms enacted in Massachusetts while he was governor, seeking to benefit from an issue that caused him trouble in the Republican primaries with conservatives who detest Obama\u2019s national health care reforms. The Romney team \u201ckind of reshaped his image at the debate to make him a more moderate figure,\u201d said Ron Brownstein, the National Journal editorial director and CNN senior political analyst, adding that it \u201cwould have been dangerous to do that earlier.\u201d Romney \u201ctalked to the voters who are dissatisfied with Obama and reminded them why they were was dissatisfied and helped cross the threshold on why he would do better,\u201d while Obama \u201cdid nothing to frame the case against Romney\u201d or explain what he would do in a second term to make things better, Brownstein said. Until the first debate, he explained, Obama benefited from \u201ca slice of the electorate who were clearly dissatisfied with his first term, were not sure he deserved a second term, but weren\u2019t sure if Romney was a viable alternative,\u201d thereby providing the president some margin of comfort. \u201cI think that permanently changed at the first debate,\u201d Brownstein said. An immediate CNN/ORC International poll showed more than 60% of respondents who watched the Denver debate considered Romney the winner.  In following weeks, Romney\u2019s poll numbers rose steadily, bringing him even with Obama in an aggregate of major national surveys and moving in front in key battleground states such as Florida and North Carolina. With less than a month to go in the campaign, the Romney rise presented a potentially unstoppable problem for Obama. In response, the president adopted a more aggressive posture in the second and third debates. It focused on Romney\u2019s political shifts following his days leading moderate Massachusetts to his effort to win conservative support in the GOP primary, and then his latest move back toward the political center. Down to the wire: Campaign enters stretch run At Monday night\u2019s third and final debate in Florida, which highlighted foreign policy issues, Romney shifted or modified previous positions to agree with Obama on how to respond to the Syrian conflict and when to pull combat troops out of Afghanistan. He also supported Obama\u2019s decision to take out al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and to expand the use of drones to go after terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But Romney also sought to present himself as a reasonable \u2013 and possibly more reasonable \u2013 alternative to the president. \u201cWe can\u2019t kill our way out of this mess,\u201d Romney said of combating terrorism, and he pushed for \u201ca comprehensive strategy\u201d to curb violent extremism in the Middle East. \u201cThe key that we\u2019re going to have to pursue is a \u2013 is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own,\u201d Romney said, proposing U.S. policies to promote economic development, better education, gender equity and to help create institutions. However, he was unable to express any significant policy difference with Obama on how that would happen. Obama responded by criticizing his opponent for proposing \u201cwrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map,\u201d and analysts described Romney\u2019s positions as attacking Obama from the left, rather than the right. Fareed Zakaria of CNN and Time magazine joked that Romney\u2019s stance invoked the spirit of anti-war Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern, who died over the weekend. Meanwhile, Republican strategists said Romney achieved his goal of coming off as presidential, an assertion backed by the CNN/ORC poll that showed both candidates got high marks from respondents for leadership ability. Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, said that was very important. He noted that 24% of those questioned said the debate made them more likely to vote for Obama while 25% said it nudged them toward Romney, and 50% said they were not influence either way. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to change the trajectory of the result,\u201d Fleischer said. The poll also reinforced a gender gap in the race, with women favoring Obama as a strong leader by 59% to 39%, while men chose Romney by 53% to 43%. Obama needs to repeat the strong support from women voters \u2013 who comprise half the electorate \u2013 that helped him win in 2008. Obama continued his criticism of Romney at a campaign event Tuesday in the Sunshine State, a major battleground where Romney has a slight edge, according to the latest polls. \u201cWe are accustomed to seeing politicians change their positions from like four years ago,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe are not accustomed to seeing politicians change their positions from four days ago.\u201d It comes down to trust, he continued, adding that \u201cthe person who leads this country, you have got to have confidence that he or she means what he or she says.\u201d The Romney campaign called such criticism the hallmark of an incumbent who knows he is losing. \u201cWhile the Obama campaign continues to engage in desperate attacks, Gov. Romney will continue talking about his plan for a real recovery for the middle class, which has suffered under the failed Obama policies of the last four years,\u201d said a statement by Rich Beeson, Romney\u2019s political director. In the Republican primaries, Romney came under strong attack from conservative challengers, including Gingrich, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, for being too moderate too face Obama. Santorum said Romney\u2019s health care law in Massachusetts made him incapable of challenging Obama on the federal law opposed by conservatives, while Gingrich sounded criticism similar to what Obama says now in accusing Romney of changing positions for political reasons. Romney managed to successfully navigate the primary minefield by alternating between aggressive attacks on his foes. For example, he accused Perry of being soft on illegal immigration, and at times trying to remain above the arguing between his rivals as they took turns in leading the field and becoming the main focus of criticism from the others. The GOP debates included memorable meltdowns and other moments that narrowed the field, such as when Perry couldn\u2019t remember the name of one of three government departments he pledged to cut. Romney emerged as the survivor, but rarely won more than 50% of the vote in any of the primaries until his nomination was certain. In the presidential debates, Romney\u2019s strong start changed the equation of the race and sparked a revitalized response from Obama. Post-debate polls showed respondents thought Obama won both of the final two encounters. Now the question is whether the president\u2019s stronger performance translates to any bump in support, or at least slows or halts Romney\u2019s recent gains. It all shows that debates do matter, and never more so than in this election cycle.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Barack Obama calls Mitt Romney's proposals \"sketchy\" NEW: Romney says Obama is out of ideas and \"running on fumes\" Romney's running mate says the Obama team changed its story on Libya Vice President Joe Biden says Republicans are politicizing a tragedy A sharp exchange over the U.S. response to the September 11 terrorist attack in Libya dominated the political discussion on Wednesday following a bruising debate that analysts and polls scored a victory for President Barack Obama over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Tuesday night debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, featured a revitalized  Obama fighting back against his equally combative GOP foe in an argumentative encounter three weeks before Election Day. With a third and final debate next week, the candidates appeared likely to secure their standing in an already tight race that portends a cliffhanger presidential vote. On Wednesday, both campaigns continued their focus on battleground states considered crucial to winning the White House. Obama headed to Iowa, where he took aim at Romney proposals at an event at Cornell College in Mount Vernon. \u201cHis tax plan doesn\u2019t add up.  His jobs plan doesn\u2019t create jobs.  His deficit reduction plan adds to the deficit,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo Iowa \u2013 everybody here has heard of the New Deal, you\u2019ve heard of the Fair Deal, you\u2019ve heard of the square deal - Mitt Romney is trying to sell you a sketchy deal.\u201d Romney campaigned in Virginia, where he said the president was out of ideas after what he called four years of failed leadership. \u201cI think it is pretty clear that when it comes to his policies and his answers and his agenda he is pretty much running on fumes,\u201d Romney told a campaign event in Chesapeake. His running mate, conservative Rep. Paul Ryan, offered a similar attack line at his own event in Ohio, saying sluggish growth and high unemployment \u201cmay be the best President Obama can give us, but it\u2019s not the best we can give ourselves.\u201d Obama also will campaign in Ohio later Wednesday and Vice President Joe Biden heads to Colorado and Nevada. In the second debate, Obama rebounded from a lackluster performance in the initial meeting with Romney two weeks ago in Denver. Obama forcefully defended his policies and challenged Romney on shifting positions on key issues while arguing his Republican rival\u2019s proposals would favor the wealthy if elected on November 6. Romney repeatedly attacked Obama\u2019s record, saying millions of unemployed people and a sluggish economic recovery showed the president\u2019s policies had failed. On the sensitive topic of the Libya attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, Romney suggested the Obama administration played politics by failing to immediately acknowledge what happened. Obama shot back that the suggestion anyone in his administration would play politics on such an issue was \u201coffensive.\u201d When Obama said he called it an act of terror shortly after it occurred, Romney challenged him, and Obama responded by saying \u201ccheck the transcript.\u201d Moderator Candy Crowley, CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, cut in to say both men were right \u2013 Obama referred to an act of terror shortly after the attack, but the administration took longer to fully explain what occurred. Ryan challenged that assessment on Wednesday, telling CBS that Obama\u2019s initial remarks on the Benghazi attack were \u201ca passing reference to acts of terror in general.\u201d He noted that Obama and others, including U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, subsequently suggested the violence spawned from a protest over an anti-Islam video before clarifying two weeks later it was a terrorist attack. \u201cThe facts just don\u2019t square with that line of argument,\u201d Ryan said. Another Republican, Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia, told CNN that Crowley\u2019s intervention helped Obama. \u201cThat may have thrown Governor Romney off his game just for a second,\u201d Gingrey said Wednesday, insisting later that whether intended or not, Crowley \u201cdid aid and abet President Obama in that exchange.\u201d Biden and a top Obama campaign strategist called the Republican criticism an attempt to play politics with a tragic issue. \u201cIt became so clear to the American people how Governor Romney and the campaign continue to try to politicize a tragedy,\u201d Biden told ABC. \u201cAnd their strategy seems to be to make it appear that the president didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t know, or was lying. The fact of the matter is, the president was clear. We are going to get to the bottom of this. The whole world will know it.\u201d Robert Gibbs, a former White House press secretary now helping the Obama campaign, said Romney\u2019s response to the Libya attack and other anti-U.S. violence in Egypt included an initial erroneous statement and now what he called trying \u201clike Olympic gymnasts to politicize the issue by doing whatever they have to do.\u201d Romney \u201chas handled this thing enormously poorly from his very first response all the way through this debate,\u201d Gibbs told CNN, adding that the former Massachusetts governor \u201cdoesn\u2019t look look a strong commander in chief.\u201d The Romney campaign seeks to make the Libya attack a major campaign issue to try to cut into Obama\u2019s advantage over Romney on foreign policy issues, according to polls. The third and final presidential debate next Monday in Florida will focus on foreign policy. Both candidates walked the floor with microphones in hand during the 90-plus minute debate on Tuesday, raising their voices at times and repeatedly challenging each other\u2019s points. Crowley tried in vain at times to prevent each man from going over allotted time, with Obama speaking for more than three minutes longer than Romney overall. However, a count by CNN showed that for the second straight debate, Romney spoke more words despite talking for a shorter time. Obama was on the attack from the start, but waited until his final answer \u2013 with no chance for Romney to respond \u2013 to raise his opponent\u2019s controversial \u201c47%\u201d comments at a fundraiser in May. In remarks made public by a secretly recorded video of the event, Romney described 47% of the country as people dependent on government aid who refused to take personal responsibility. The president was criticized after the first debate for not raising the issue and he made sure to do so this time. \u201cThink about who he was talking about,\u201d Obama said, listing people on Social Security \u201cwho\u2019ve worked all their lives,\u201d veterans \u201cwho\u2019ve sacrificed for this country,\u201d students, soldiers and \u201cpeople working hard every day.\u201d The president said he wanted to fight for those people \u201cbecause if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.\u201d Earlier, Obama went after Romney\u2019s five-point economic plan that the GOP candidate repeated two times during the debate, saying it really was a one-point plan \u201cand that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.\u201d Romney shot back that \u201cif you elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get \u2013 you\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years.\u201d Over and over, Romney described what he called the failings of Obama\u2019s policies including rising federal deficits and debts, more than 20 million people unemployed and anemic economic growth. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to settle for what we\u2019re going through,\u201d Romney said at one point. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don\u2019t have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don\u2019t have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don\u2019t have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We don\u2019t have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.\u201d Obama was \u201cgreat as a speaker, but his policies don\u2019t work,\u201d Romney said. Attempting to rebut Obama\u2019s criticism of his own policies, Romney insisted he would prioritize middle class growth, saying \u201cit\u2019s about how we can get the middle class of this country a bright and prosperous future.\u201d However, Romney failed to provide further specifics of his tax policy, even when one audience member asked about unspecified deductions and loopholes the candidate says he will eliminate. A CNN/ORC International poll of people who watched the debate indicated that 46% thought Obama won, compared to 39% for Romney. The result was within the survey\u2019s margin of error, and responses to other questions showed debate watchers favored Romney on the economy and other major issues. After the first debate on October 3, a similar poll showed Romney scored a solid victory in the eyes of more than 60% of respondents. \u201cMost improved \u2013 that award goes to Barack Obama,\u201d CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said. Daily Beast\u2019s Andrew Sullivan, who called Obama\u2019s poll numbers after the first debate \u201cdevastating,\u201d predicted the president would come \u201ckicking back in the polls\u201d in coming days. Erick Erickson, the conservative RedState.com blogger and CNN contributor, thought Romney won the debate based on \u201cclear majorities outside the margin of error\u201d in the CNN/ORC poll who thought Romney would be better for the country on economic issues. \u201cIn fact, while other areas of the debate may overshadow this point, Romney deftly dispatched Obama on his economic record,\u201d Erickson said, calling it \u201cthe one issue that matters.\u201d An awkward phrase by Romney in addressing gender pay inequality was creating the most buzz around the debate. Romney said when he was elected governor of Massachusetts, all the applicants for cabinet positions were men, so he sought out women applicants. \u201cI went to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u2018Can you help us find folks?\u2019 and they brought us whole binders full of women.\u201d Before the debate was over \u201cbinders full of women\u201d had a\u00a0Twitter hashtag, a series of memes\u00a0on Tumblr, and\u00a0a Facebook page with over more than 100,000 fans. The phrase was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate. Unlike the first presidential debate, the town hall-style format allowed audience members to ask the questions. Crowley, the first woman to serve as moderator of a presidential debate in 20 years, tried to get in as many of the questions as possible from the uncommitted voters in the hall, sometimes struggling to cut off the candidates as they tried to make points or argued with each other. Questions addressed troubles finding jobs, tax policy and immigration, with Romney saying Obama failed to deliver on a promise to pass a major immigration overhaul while the president said Romney backed conservative positions such as opposing a measure that gives some children of unregistered immigrants a path to legal status. Obama repeated his past criticism that Romney\u2019s tax plan doesn\u2019t add up, saying \u201cwhen he\u2019s asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he can\u2019t tell you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to be paying for it,\u201d Obama said of middle class taxpayers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose some deductions, and you can\u2019t buy the sales pitch. Nobody who\u2019s looked at it that\u2019s serious actually believes it adds up.\u201d Romney, meanwhile, repeatedly insisted his plan won\u2019t raise taxes for middle class Americans but also won\u2019t raise or lower the tax burden on the wealthy, in contrast to Obama\u2019s proposal to let tax rates on the top 2% of wage earners return to higher tax rates from the Clinton era. The president needed a strong debate to try to blunt Romney\u2019s rise in the polls after their first showdown. The most recent CNN \u201cpoll of polls\u201d \u2013 an aggregate of the latest major surveys \u2013 showed Romney with a slight edge nationally at 48%-47%. In the battleground states considered up-for-grabs, polls show Romney has narrowed Obama\u2019s lead or caught the president. CNN\u2019s Keating Holland and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

The first question came from a 20-year-old college student, worried about whether he\u2019d be able to support himself after graduation. \u201cMore debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again,\u201d Romney said, addressing the first-time voter. \u201cWhen you come out in 2014 \u2013 I presume I\u2019m going to be president \u2013 I\u2019m going to make sure you get a job.\u201d Test your knowledge with debate trivia Later questions addressed immigration, with Romney saying Obama failed to deliver on a promise to pass a major immigration overhaul while the president said Romney backed conservative positions such as opposing a measure that gives some children of unregistered immigrants a path to legal status. Obama repeated his past criticism that Romney\u2019s tax plan doesn\u2019t add up, saying \u201cwhen he\u2019s asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he can\u2019t tell you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to be paying for it,\u201d Obama said of middle class taxpayers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose some deductions, and you can\u2019t buy the sales pitch. Nobody who\u2019s looked at it that\u2019s serious actually believes it adds up.\u201d Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate Romney, meanwhile, repeatedly insisted his plan won\u2019t raise taxes for middle class Americans but also won\u2019t raise or lower the tax burden on the wealthy, in contrast to Obama\u2019s proposal to let tax rates on the top 2% of wage earners return to higher tax rates from the Clinton era. The president needed a strong debate to try to blunt Romney\u2019s rise in the polls after their first showdown. The most recent CNN \u201cpoll of polls\u201d \u2013 an aggregate of the latest major surveys \u2013 showed Romney with a slight edge nationally at 48%-47%. In the battleground states considered up-for-grabs, polls show Romney has narrowed Obama\u2019s lead or caught the president. The Obama campaign conceded he had a bad night in the first debate and promised a more aggressive approach in New York. A third and final debate focusing on foreign policy will take place October 22 in Florida. Polls show voters consider the economy to be the most important election issue. Where they stand: The candidates and issues Unemployment fell below 8% in September for the first time since the month Obama took office in 2009. However, continuing high unemployment and slow growth have made the president vulnerable. Romney and his campaign have sought to frame the election as a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency, citing joblessness, slow recovery from the recession and chronic federal deficits and debt as reasons to deny a second term. For their part, Obama and Democrats have tried to make the election about competing visions for the future. They argue Republican proposals to repeal major legislation, such as health care and Wall Street reforms, while cutting government and expanding tax cuts without identifying additional revenue sources would stall a sluggish but steady recovery.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney stumbles into a mess of his own making on auto bailout and squabbles with moderator Attack on Benghazi mission still an issue for Romney to take advantage of Barack Obama hits all the marks that he missed in first lackluster debate performance Analyst describes rivals as 'two high school jocks who don't like each other' While President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney were ostensibly responding to questions from uncommitted voters at a town hall-style debate on Tuesday, they found plenty of opportunities to attack each other during the 90-minute encounter. With three weeks until Election Day and their third and final debate focused on foreign policy and national security next week, it was their last opportunity to go head to head on the economy and other domestic issues. Here are five things we learned from Round Two: 1. The old Romney rears his head Romney has a knack for hurting himself. He has been stung by his self-inflicted wounds throughout the 2012 campaign (\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the very poor\u201d springs to mind). The GOP nominee stumbled into a few messes of his own making on Tuesday. The second presidential debate Romney: High-income tax will be same Obama, Romney clash over energy Obama, Romney get heated over Libya Just after the debate began, Obama landed a clean hit on Romney over his opposition to the federal bailout of Chrysler and General Motors. CNN Poll: Nearly half say Obama won showdown Instead of letting the moment pass and moving on to the next question, Romney decided to once again relitigate the auto bailout, a measure supported by a large majority of voters in the presidential  battleground of Ohio. \u201cHe said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy\u2019s and Continental Airlines and come out stronger.\u201d The end result? When he had a chance to mitigate the damage, Romney instead reminded millions of viewers that he would have let the auto industry go under without government help. As the saying goes: When you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing. Later, Romney got into a series of nit-picky squabbles with moderator Candy Crowley over the mechanics of the debate \u2013 the order of questions, equal time and the like. It didn\u2019t sound bold or presidential, and it called to mind Romney\u2019s helpless appeal to Anderson Cooper during a 2011 Republican primary when Rick Perry kept interrupting him. Then there was his finale, when he seemed to allude to his cringe-inducing remarks about 47% of Americans as people dependent on government who refused to take personal responsibility. \u201cI care about 100% of the American people,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI want 100% of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.\u201d Obama, inexplicably, had not mentioned the 47% comments all night. But it seemed as if Romney had given him a reminder, and Obama promptly teed off on the secretly taped fundraising comments when his turn to speak came around. Analysis: Romney whiffs on some easy pitches 2. Republicans see an opening on Libya It was one of Obama\u2019s brightest moments of the night. U.S. presidential debate: Who won? Race for the White House heats up Reality Check: Illegal immigration Obama, Romney on assault weapons He sternly turned to Romney, who had just accused the president of misleading voters about the terrorist attack on the U.S. mission in Libya that killed four Americans, and essentially told him: How dare you. \u201cThe suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we\u2019ve lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do. That\u2019s not what I do as president, that\u2019s not what I do as commander in chief.\u201d Points for the president. But Obama\u2019s insistence that he called the Benghazi tragedy a terrorist attack from the outset still drew scorn from Romney, who said the administration had actually blamed the attack on a mob incited by an anti-Muslim YouTube video. President Obama on Benghazi: \u2018I am always responsible\u2019 After the debate, Romney advisers made an issue of the administration\u2019s varying answers on Libya and vowed to push it in the coming days. They circulated talking points to campaign surrogates, highlighting Obama\u2019s speech to the United Nations in which he seemed to blame the attack, in part, on a mob and not terrorists. \u201cWhat has happened is a perceived advantage for the president on foreign policy has been reversed because of what happened in Benghazi and how the president responded to it,\u201d Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Romney confidant, told reporters after the debate. \u201cThe issue was an issue that was to the president\u2019s favor. He was someone that was more respected on foreign policy as of a couple weeks ago. That has changed now.\u201d But how much will Libya resonate with voters who place the economy atop their list of concerns? Even Portman acknowledged that foreign policy only ranks \u201cprobably 7 or 8 or 9\u201d on the list of issues voters deem important. Still, he argued, it\u2019s one more chink in the armor for a president running neck-and-neck with his challenger. Obama gets edge over Romney in bruising debate 3. Obama throws the briefing book at Romney If Obama didn\u2019t glance at his briefing book before the Denver debate, he definitely did this time. From the outset, Obama sounded like he was sending a bouquet to his rapid response team in Chicago, a group of hard-charging staffers that pushes anti-Romney stories to campaign reporters on a daily basis. Answering the first question of the debate, which was about jobs, the president unloaded on the Republican nominee, saying, \u201cwhen Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said we\u2019re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\u2019s come surging back.\u201d That was soon followed by a scathing attack on the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s signature economic plan. \u201cGovernor Romney doesn\u2019t have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan.  And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules,\u201d claimed Obama. And the president attacked Romney\u2019s proposals to reform taxes and lower the deficit. \u201cGovernor Romney was a very successful investor.  If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, \u2018Here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we\u2019re going to pay for it, but we can\u2019t tell you until maybe after the election how we\u2019re going to do it,\u2019 you wouldn\u2019t take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d Town hall format leads to close-quarter exchanges Then there was this zinger on outsourcing: \u201cGovernor, you\u2019re the last person who\u2019s going to get tough on China.\u201d Obama also criticized Romney over the rate he pays on his federal taxes, his stance on health care coverage for contraception and his calls to cut federal funding for Planned Parenthood, his plans to reform Medicare, and his support of Arizona\u2019s controversial illegal immigration law. The reference to Romney\u2019s \u201c47%\u201d controversy came just before the closing bell. The president sure seemed like he was trying to make up lost ground following his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate two weeks ago. The Obama campaign claimed victory. \u201cYou saw Governor Romney backpedaling all night, you saw him defensive, in some cases stammering, trying to explain his plans,\u201d senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod told reporters after the debate.  \u201cIt was a dominant performance because the president pulled the curtain back on this bait-and-switch of Mitt Romney.\u201d The Romney campaign disagreed. \u201cI think President Obama came in and overcompensated,\u201d senior Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between showing passion and showing you having a plan.\u201d What did people who watched the debate think? By a 49%\u201335% margin, debate watchers questioned in a CNN/ORC International poll said that Obama spent more time than Romney attacking his opponent. And nearly three-quarters said the president performed better than expected. Maybe the president took note of Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s aggressive debate performance in last week\u2019s vice presidential showdown with GOP runningmate Rep. Paul Ryan. Regardless, we learned that Obama was able to step it up when it mattered the most. 4. These guys don\u2019t like each other very much It\u2019s pretty obvious \u2013 Obama and Romney don\u2019t like each other. Need more proof? The second debate provided plenty of examples. The two candidates stood toe-to-toe and clashed over domestic oil production. \u201cGovernor, we have actually produced more oil,\u201d said Obama. \u201cNo, no.  How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?\u201d asked Romney. Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate \u201cGovernor Romney, here\u2019s what we did.  There were a whole bunch of oil companies,\u201d responded Obama. \u201cNo, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?\u201d interrupted Romney \u201cYou want me to answer a question,\u201d fought back Obama. \u201cHow much did you cut them by?\u201d asked Romney again. \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer the question,\u201d fired back Obama. Another heated exchange between the candidates ended with Romney pushing back at an interruption by the president by saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance in a moment but I\u2019m still talking.\u201d That moment brought gasps from some in the audience. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos described the debate as a clash between \u201ctwo high school jocks who didn\u2019t like each other very much.\u201d 5. Romney has binders full of women It was your Internet meme of the night. Asked about his support for women in the workplace, Romney recalled the hiring process he implemented after becoming Massachusetts governor. \u201cWe took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI went to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u2018Can you help us find folks,\u2019 and they brought us whole binders full of women.\u201d Binders. Full of women! The strange turn of phrase quickly became a trending topic on Twitter and the title of a brand new Tumblr blog mocking the Republican nominee\u2019s awkward word choice. Beyond the jokes, the answer called attention to Romney\u2019s tightrope walk on a sensitive issue for women. During the Republican primaries, Romney refused to say whether he would have supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill Obama signed into law. His campaign later said it wouldn\u2019t support the repeal of the law \u2013 hardly a ringing endorsement. So on Wednesday, when asked about equal pay, Romney resorted to personal anecdotes about women he once hired and promised to fix the economy so more women can find jobs. Obama, like he did all night, pounced. \u201cWhen Governor Romney\u2019s campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said I\u2019ll get back to you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.\u201d Read the full transcript of the debate or watch it on CNN.com",

            "article_content": "First test for both candidates is who looks like a president Obama could have vulnerability on Libya attack, but agenda is domestic Whose narrative on how to get the economy going will play best to voters? President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney face off on Wednesday in the first of three presidential debates. While Obama holds a lead in several key battleground states, the race nationally has been locked in a dead heat for months. The debate offers an opportunity for Obama or Romney to gain some momentum and break the logjam. Here are five things to watch for on Wednesday: 1. Who\u2019s presidential? The first and most important test for the president and Romney in this opening debate is to act like they belong in the job. Comebacks, zingers can impact debates Obama, Romney prep debate face-off Debate body language speaks volumes Debates determine Super Pac spending? We\u2019ve heard a lot of bickering on the campaign trail, and there\u2019s plenty of talk that zingers could decide who wins or loses the showdown in Denver. But to most Americans, this debate is really about which candidate has the composure and stature to serve in the Oval Office. What they stand for: Candidates at a glance \u201cIf either the president or Romney can\u2019t pass this test, the rest really don\u2019t matter. Big ideas from a small person won\u2019t make you president of the United States,\u201d says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cWhen the moment comes, this is like proposing to your wife. This is a big moment.\u201d Thanks to already serving nearly four years in the White House, Obama starts with the advantage, but he can\u2019t afford to play it safe at the debate. John King: The debates are all about trust \u201cPlaying it safe allows Romney to dominate the agenda and put Obama on defense. Either you\u2019re on offense or defense, and defense loses,\u201d adds Castellanos, who was a senior adviser to Romney in 2008 election. By comparison, Romney has to do double duty: Stay on offense but also look presidential. What does Obama have to do? \u201cKeep cool \u2013 which comes naturally to him,\u201d says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. \u201cMake it about the middle class, not himself or Romney.\u201d 2. Can Romney get Libya into the discussion? The first debate is officially devoted to domestic policy. The listed topics, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates, are the economy, health care, the role of government and governing \u2013 whatever that means. Matters of national security and foreign policy are being left to later debates, but Romney may not be content to wait that long with the drip-drip-drip of conflicting news continuing to emerge from Libya, where four Americans \u2013 including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens \u2013 were killed in an apparent terrorist attack last month. Serious questions have been raised for the Obama administration in the wake of the Libya attack: Was the American compound in Benghazi secure before the attack? Did U.S. officials fail to heed warnings or concerns about possible violence? Why has the president been so hesitant to describe the incident as a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d? Why is the scene still not secure, more than two weeks after the attack? House GOP wants State Dept. to answer for Libya security \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a confused, slow, inconsistent response to what is now very clearly known as a terrorist act,\u201d Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan said on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s really indicative of a broader failure of this administration\u2019s foreign policy and the crisis that is taking place across the Middle East.\u201d Polls indicate that the economy remains the top issue for voters, and Romney advisers in Boston believe the same. And when it comes to foreign policy, more voters trust Obama than Romney, polls show. But there are hints of vulnerability for the president on Libya crisis. In a recent Fox News poll, 43% of voters said they disapproved of Obama\u2019s performance on Libya, while 39% approved. With his campaign scrambling for traction and looking for any opportunity to shrink the trust gap between himself and the president, it won\u2019t be a shocker if Romney brings up the Middle East turmoil on Wednesday night and ties it to a broader critique of the president\u2019s leadership. Obama, Romney only met a few times 3. Who makes the case on the economy? In a debate focusing on domestic concerns, the economy is the issue that should dominate the debate. The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters and according to a new CNN/ORC International poll, likely voters are split on whether the president or the Republican nominee would do a better job fixing the economy over the next four years. Expect to hear two very different narratives on Wednesday night. The president will continue to argue that the country\u2019s making progress and that now is not the time to go back to the policies of the George W. Bush years that got us into the current mess. And he\u2019ll say that now\u2019s not the time to go back to helping the millionaires and Wall Street. Expect a very different narrative from Romney. In his year and a half long bid for the White House, one of the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s main arguments is that thanks to his business background, he can do a better job creating jobs than Obama has done over the past four years. The debate in Denver gives Romney a well-watched platform to make his case. Romney: Debates aren\u2019t about a win Romney \u201chas to explain a rationale that he\u2019s offering change that would make things better over the next four years,\u201d says Castellanos. \u201cThis is his opportunity to present his counternarrative, that Obama\u2019s growing the wrong economy. He need say that Washington\u2019s economy is doing just fine, and ask how your economy\u2019s doing.\u201d Whichever candidate better presents and sells his economic narrative will go a long way toward determining who wins the debate, and more importantly, who wins the minds of undecided voters. 4. Can Obama get women and Latinos into the discussion? Romney carved out positions during the Republican primaries that have landed him in a deep hole with Hispanic and female voters. Remember the so-called \u201cwar on women\u201d? In the course of trying to out-conservative his GOP rivals, Romney vowed to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, came out against a law that mandates insurance companies cover contraception services and did not take a stand on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that Obama signed in 2009. He has also said he wants the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Romney also rankled Hispanics by calling elements of Arizona\u2019s tough immigration law a \u201cmodel\u201d for the nation, floating the notion of \u201cself-deportation\u201d and promising to veto the DREAM Act, which would offer a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants. Latino vote in Nevada up for grabs The Obama campaign has exploited these positions to great effect, pushing them to women and Hispanics in swing state campaign appearances, targeted e-mails and niche media efforts. (Don\u2019t know who Cristina Saralegui is? Google her.) Republicans have criticized those tactics as a cynical distraction from the sagging economy, but they\u2019re working. A Quinnipiac poll of Ohio likely voters released last week, for instance, showed Romney losing women to Obama by a staggering 25-point margin. Internal Romney polling, meanwhile, has him badly trailing Obama among Hispanics \u2013 and it\u2019s been that way all year. With more than 50 million people expected to tune in Wednesday evening, don\u2019t expect the president to pass up a golden opportunity to keep female and Hispanic-oriented issues in the national spotlight. In debates, presidential candidates\u2019 tics and tells matter 5. Taking the zing out of zingers It was just one line in a New York Times story last weekend about each candidate\u2019s debate cram sessions, but it grabbed a lot of attention. \u201cMr. Romney\u2019s team has concluded that debates are about creating moments and has equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August,\u201d reporters Ashley Parker and Peter Baker wrote in the paper. Obama: \u2018They\u2019re making me do my homework\u2019 Romney advisers are correct that voters are likely to walk away from the debate talking about distinctive moments \u2013 audible sighs, body language, repeated use of phrases such as \u201clock box\u201d \u2013 rather than factoids about Medicare Advantage or sequestration. But zingers? The Obama team predictably pounced on that one. iReporters square off before the debate \u201cWe also saw in reports that Mitt Romney and his team have been working on zingers and special lines for months,\u201d Obama spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters over the weekend. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the president\u2019s focus is on. So if you\u2019re expecting that, that\u2019s probably not what he\u2019s going to deliver on.\u201d Romney delivered his lines with precision during the Republican primary debates and probably will again on Wednesday. But if it comes to pass that Romney jabs at Obama with a sharp attack or humorous quip, you can be sure the president\u2019s allies will be ready to mock Romney\u2019s reliance on prepared \u201czingers\u201d to diminish his stature and performance.

In this corner: Alex Anderson, a college student in Hillsdale, Michigan, pulling for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. In that corner: Omekongo Dibinga, a longtime iReporter from Washington and a supporter of President Barack Obama. Both had a chance to see their candidates\u2019 political conventions, as winners of the Your Political Ticket iReport contest. With that experience behind them, we asked them to go head to head on Google+ previewing Wednesday\u2019s first presidential debate. They are two of hundreds of iReporters who have added their views to the iReport debate, an eight-month project that invites voters to make their voices heard this election season. What to watch in tonight\u2019s debate Obama, Romney prep debate face-off Debate body language speaks volumes Comebacks, zingers can impact debates Michelle Obama: Debates make me nervous We came away with three main points from the conversation, some of which you can see in the video above. 1. How important is a \u2018personal connection?\u2019 \u201cThe biggest plus [Obama] has over Romney are the social issues,\u201d said Dibinga. \u201cWhen you look at issues such as immigration and his educational stances, it seems to me that President Obama is in line with the majority of Americans.\u201d Anderson said that the president may be able to connect personally with Americans on certain issues and in speeches, but rhetoric and action are two different things. \u201cThrough his time at Bain Capital, with the Olympics and his time as governor [of Massachusetts, Romney] had results from his actions. Candidates \u2018tics,\u2019 actions matter in debates 2. Weighing the past versus the future Anderson echoed Romney\u2019s contention that Obama has not left Americans better off than four years ago. He said that Romney has laid out incentives as to what would happen under his presidency, and portrayed Obama as saying that Americans should \u201cignore\u201d the past four years. Dibinga said that Obama can\u2019t tout unemployment in this country as long as it\u2019s over 8%, but at the same time, Romney cannot point to his record as governor. \u201cSome things [he did] such as health care are similar to President Obama. Romney will increase our issues as to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer; setting women\u2019s rights back; and setting education back.\u201d 3. Debate the big picture Anderson hoped the debates will help paint a better picture of each candidate\u2019s plan for America. He also hoped that \u201csmall things\u201d like \u201ctax returns and birth certificates\u201d would not dominate the debates. On this point, Dibinga agreed. \u201cNo cheap shots. Romney and Obama have very different views on where the country should go. The issues are strong enough for Americans to decide for themselves.\u201d Watch the video and let us know who won the debate by commenting below, and share your question for the candidates here, and check out the top questions other iReporters want answered.",

            "article_content": "The Republican nominee has not specified publicly on favorites for the court Many names are relatively young judges appointed by George W. Bush. Seven potential candidates are appeals court judges Here is an unofficial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court if Mitt Romney is elected president in November. This list was compiled from a number of sources, including those serving as informal advisers to the Romney campaign. The Republican nominee has not specified publicly on favorites for the court. Many names mentioned are relatively young judges named to the federal bench by President George W. Bush. Elections raises stakes for possible high court vacancies Paul Clement, former U.S. Solicitor General Born 1966. Considered by many as one of the best lawyers of his generation. The Wisconsin native  went to Harvard Law School where he was a classmate of President Barack Obama, and later clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. He served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and earned raves for his persuasive, conservational style at oral arguments. Now a private attorney, he has become the go-to guy among conservatives to lead appeals on a variety of hot-button issues: health care reform, same-sex marriage, immigration enforcement, and gun rights. He personally argued seven cases in the 2011 term, including the health care petitions. He has been strategically coy about his chances for the high court, saying he would be honored but remains focused on his law practice. Supreme Court possibilities if Obama is reelected Judge Brett Kavanaugh, U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit Born 1965. Began his job May 2006 in a court that has seen several of its former members make the jump to the Supreme Court. A former top official in the George W. Bush White House. His nomination to a federal appeals court for the D.C. circuit was held up for three years by Democrats. Senators Patrick Leahy and Richard Durbin later accused Kavanaugh of misleading the Judiciary Committee during his confirmation over whether he helped formulate policy on the detention and questioning of accused terrorists held overseas by the U.S. military. He is relatively young and considered one of the brightest conservative legal minds. He co-authored the Starr Report investigation of President Bill Clinton and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy and conservative appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski. Judge Diane Sykes, 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Milwaukee Born 1957. A former private lawyer, county judge, and justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Named to current post in 2004. She is a Federalist Society member and her profile has been increasing among many conservatives. Being a woman and from the Midwest may be seen as pluses if Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were to step down. Wrote a 2011 opinion affirming firing ranges were protected under the Second Amendment, tossing out enforcement of a city ban in Chicago. Toobin: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? Has 'Obamacare' changed the court? Sen. Mike Lee, Republican from Utah Born 1971. The youngest U.S. senator. The rising GOP star may have the best credentials of any lawmaker to be a justice. Like Romney, he is a Mormon. Lee is a former appellate and constitutional lawyer in Utah and Washington, who twice clerked for Justice Samuel Alito, on both the federal appeals court and later the Supreme Court. His father, Rex, is a former U.S. solicitor general and founding dean at Brigham Young Law School. Lee faces re-election in 2016, and may feel politically obliged to complete his first Senate term before considering a judicial seat. Judge Steven Colloton, 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, works in Des Moines, Iowa Born 1963. Appointed by George W. Bush and former law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He is a former Justice Department lawyer, U.S. Attorney in Iowa, and lawyer in the Starr Independent Counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton. Judge Neil Gorsuch, 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Denver Born 1967. Appointed by George W. Bush. Harvard law School graduate who clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. He went into private practice  in Washington before joining the Bush Justice Department. His mother, Anne Burford, was the first woman to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. He wrote the book: \u201cThe Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.\u201d Judge Jeffrey Sutton, 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, works in Columbus, Ohio Born 1960. Appointed by George W. Bush. He once clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. He was the state solicitor in Ohio. Considered a conservative intellectual force on the court. But Republicans may not forgive him when Sutton became the first Republican-appointed judge to back the health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Judge Janice Rogers Brown, U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit Born 1949. Former California Supreme Court justice, who was among the first African-Americans appointed to that bench. Regarded as a strong reliable conservative in GOP circles. Her father was a sharecropper and she attended segregated schools before moving to Sacramento. She worked in the state attorney general\u2019s office, was Gov. Pete Wilson\u2019s legal secretary, and a state appeals judge. A former liberal and considered iconoclastic with strong religious convictions. Her nomination to the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit was held up by partisan wrangling. That and her age would be factors against high court consideration. Judge Allyson Duncan, 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, works in Raleigh, North Carolina Born 1951. Appointed by George W. Bush. First African-American woman on that court. Strong resume: Duke University Law School, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission attorney \u2013 where she worked with Clarence Thomas. Law professor and private attorney.",

            "article_content": "Some Latinos in hard-hit Nevada are considering voting for Mitt Romney But for many, immigration is a deciding issue One GOP activist says his party has not done enough to connect with Latinos He says President Barack Obama's appearance with Mexican band Mana was great strategy Marlene Monteolivo was a Democrat for many years, then a Republican. Now she\u2019s registered as a nonpartisan voter in Nevada who wants to support a candidate who will make the economy better. The Colombia native, who works for a Las Vegas social services agency, says she\u2019s leaning toward GOP challenger Mitt Romney. She likes his business sensibilities. But there\u2019s a hiccup. And it\u2019s a big one called immigration. It\u2019s the 200-pound anchor on the Republican message, say experts in Nevada politics. Many Latino voters will tell you \u201cIt\u2019s immigration, stupid,\u201d in the vein of the famously coined phrase on the economy during Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign. Monteolivo doesn\u2019t like that Republicans blocked passage of the Dream Act, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She bristled at Romney\u2019s comment that 47% of Americans feel entitled to government aid. She took it to mean that Latinos, many of whom are not well off, are considered freeloaders. Come November, Monteolivo says, her option might be to \u201cvote for none of the above.\u201d Romney and President Barack Obama are vying for the attention of 268,000 eligible Latino voters in Nevada, a critical bloc in a battleground state that is still reeling from the Great Recession. Nevada leads the nation in the number of foreclosures and in the unemployment rate \u2013 12.6%. The rate among Hispanics is even worse \u2013 a dismal 14.6%. Add that to Latino disillusion with Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and Romney ought to be able to grab a chunk of Latino voters, says Carlo Maffatt, who works on Latino outreach for the Republican Party. \u201cWith the economy as bad as it is, you would think lot of people would blame Obama and say, \u2018Let me give Mitt Romney a shot,\u2019 \u201d Maffatt says. But that\u2019s not the case. In 2008, Nevada Latinos overwhelmingly voted for Obama, with whose help he handily defeated Arizona Sen. John McCain. Latinos were energized then by the promise of change in America\u2019s immigration policies. Four years later, the Dream Act \u2013 designed to create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants \u2013 is all but dead on Capitol Hill. Obama did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought to America as children. But that does not change current immigration law. \u201cYou hear Latino voices saying. \u2018Obama has not delivered,\u2019 \u201d says David Damore, a University of Las Vegas political scientist. But that disappointment is more likely to translate into a \u201clet\u2019s-just-stay-at-home\u201d attitude \u2013 as is the case with Monteolivo \u2013 instead of voting GOP, even though Romney has tried to hit home with his message in Nevada. \u201cI have walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them,\u201d Romney said in a speech in Las Vegas earlier this year. \u201cWell, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help.\u201d Tough times might be the reason why Nevada has gone from a strong Obama state in 2008 to a real battleground this time around. But it may not be enough to sway Latinos. That\u2019s because many of them \u2013 such as Monteolivo \u2013 cannot get over a widely held perception that the Republican Party\u2019s immigration policy boils down to a debate on how high to build the fence along the border, Damore says. The thinking is, he says, is that maybe we should give Romney a chance to fatten our pocketbooks but we can\u2019t take the risk with immigration. That perception has not been eased any by Republican candidates in the state. In the nasty 2010 Senate race, Republican Sharron Angle claimed her opponent, veteran Sen. Harry Reid, was too soft on illegal immigration. Latino groups expressed outrage over Angle\u2019s ads that they said were racist. They featured ominous images of a border crossing and hostile-looking Latino men; one carried an assault rifle. She also drew ire for proclaiming to Hispanic school children: \u201cSome of you look a little more Asian to me.\u201d Reid defied anti-incumbent fervor to win a fifth term in office. Post-election pundits agreed that Hispanics, 15% of Nevada\u2019s electorate, had stood unified behind Reid to save him. Since then, Nevada\u2019s Latino voters have grown in numbers. They have, after all, accounted for nearly half of the overall population growth in the state over the past 10 years. Their voting clout is sure to keep rising, and they form a voting bloc that will keep gaining national significance. That clout is even heavier in an extremely close election year in which the Silver State\u2019s six electoral votes are oh so precious. Obama can no longer count on the overwhelming support of Latinos, and Romney has yet to figure out a way to connect, says Eric Herzik of the University of Nevada at Reno. \u201cThe Latino vote may not be wild about Obama, but Romney has not shown them what he can do,\u201d says Herzik, chairman of his university\u2019s political science department. Romney\u2019s argument, says Herzik, is that everyone will be better off with lower taxes and less government regulation. \u201cThat\u2019s a very nonspecific message,\u201d Herzik says for Nevadans who are about to lose their home, lose everything. \u201cMany in Nevada are saying. \u2018I\u2019m not having a problem paying my taxes. I\u2019m having a problem paying my mortgage.\u2019 \u201c Ana Navarro: To woo Latinos, Romney needs specifics If the Republicans were able to effectively lay out their economic message, they might have a chance in getting Latinos to overlook what they see as problems in GOP immigration policy, Herzik says. Omar Lopez voted for Obama in 2008 but this year, he is still undecided. Lopez\u2019s Las Vegas residential real estate business suffered a great deal in one of the hardest-hit housing markets in the country. He downsized his staff from 12 to 3. He says the president has a competitor worth listening to. In Romney, Lopez sees a successful businessman who can perhaps solve the nation\u2019s woes. The problem is he hasn\u2019t heard specifics. Last week, he went to hear Romney\u2019s son Craig speak at the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors in hopes of hearing a solid economic recovery plan. Part of that, Lopez says, has to be an emphasis on education. \u201cWe are going to crash as a nation if we stop taking away money from education and the economy will be even worse than what it is,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cOur kids are not going to college.\u201d Nevada has the highest dropout rate among the 50 states. Only about 60% of Hispanic students in Nevada graduate from high school, according to the state of Nevada. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a specific plan for education,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cHow are we going to raise our federal budget to support school programs? How are we going to motivate our teachers?\u201d Education and the economy are huge issues for Lopez, who is raising a 5-year-old son. But immigration policy is right up there. He achieved the American dream after arriving from Colombia when he was only 21 and understands why immigration is a roadblock between Latinos and the GOP. Maffatt, the GOP outreach worker, blames it partly on what he calls a lackluster effort by the Republicans. Hands down, he admits, the Democrats have done a better job connecting with Latinos. He pointed to Obama\u2019s Las Vegas campaign appearance Sunday at the predominantly Hispanic Desert Pines High School. Sharing the stage was Mexican band Mana. Obama might as well have had U2 by his side. Obama\u2019s sixth appearance in Nevada this year hit the jackpot with Latino voters, who showed up in droves if not to see him, then the hottest rock stars south of the border. Clever move, says Maffatt, who thinks the Mana concert will help re-energize Democratic Latino voters who might have become disappointed with the president\u2019s failure to pass immigration reform. \u201cIs it the right way to present a candidate? That\u2019s debatable,\u201d Maffatt says. \u201cBut the point is they are doing something. I don\u2019t see any (GOP) resources going into Nevada.\u201d Lopez, the real-estate businessman, did not go to hear Mana. He gave his four tickets away to one of his clients. She called him up the next day crying with excitement. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she told him. \u201cI got to see the president.\u201d It\u2019s those small things, Lopez says, that might help Obama with Latinos in Nevada. As for Lopez? He\u2019ll be waiting eagerly in front of his television set Wednesday night as Obama and Romney engage in their first debate. CNN iReport: What would you ask the candidates in the first debate? Lopez be tuning in for promises on education, the economy \u2013 and immigration.",

            "article_content": "Health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time Next president could name between one and three members to court California politician or low-key Washington lawyer could be next Barack Obama and Mitt Romney wasted little time rushing to the cameras when the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the president\u2019s sweeping health care reform law. Their remarks after the June ruling were a contrast of competing rhetoric over a contentious piece of legislation, and a prism into how each candidate hopes to quietly change the makeup of the federal courts. \u201cAmericans are probably paying much more attention to the economy than the Supreme Court,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, a top appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com publisher. \u201cBut they should be thinking about presidential court appointments, because they\u2019ll make a big difference in the future of the law. You think about things like same-sex marriage, affirmative action, voting rights \u2013 all of these are issues that have very different ideological components to them, and the more conservative justices definitely have a different view,\u201d he said. But the landmark health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time as a CNN/ORC poll just days later showed virtually no change in opinions on public attitudes toward Obama or Romney. It is an unusual dynamic: the Supreme Court traditionally rates near the bottom when voters are asked to list the issues most important to them, but the high-profile issues the justices decide \u2013 hot-button topics like health care, abortion, economic and tax reforms \u2013 remain of consistent concern to the electorate. Toobin: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? The high court is poised to maintain a period of bench stability for at least a couple more years, barring an unexpected illness or personal crisis. This, after four court vacancies from 2005-2010 brought on Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Still, many court watchers anticipate the man sitting in the Oval Office through 2016 could name at least one and perhaps as many as three members to the Supreme Court. And the recent health care decision may have raised the already high stakes on the makeup of the federal bench at large. Big cases await Supreme Court\u2019s 2012-13 term \u201cEven more Americans are watching who is on the Supreme Court this election cycle, more so perhaps they have in the past, because there\u2019s a clear connection between who is on the court and how that affects your daily life,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cThe Supreme Court and its ideological divide is really placing the Constitution and the country in many ways at a crossroads.\u201d Judicial philosophy Obama has touted his successful nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan, saying they fit his overall philosophy of what a good judge should be. He has been criticized in the past for using \u201cempathy\u201d as a key criterion to nominate judges. Supreme Court possibilities if Obama is reelected \u201cI think that\u2019s why he\u2019s backed off from talking about it, because ultimately the \u2018empathy\u2019 standard turns a court more into identity politics,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group. \u201cUltimately, that\u2019s actually not what Americans want. We don\u2019t want judges that are going to vote their interest group. We want judges who are going to vote with the Constitution: what they think is the correct legal and constitutional result. And that is what Governor Romney has been emphasizing,\u201d Severino said. The president\u2019s has not talked much about the high court this election year, but he has had an uneasy relationship with its conservative majority. Romney has said, if elected, he would \u201cnominate judges in the mold of Chief Justice [John] Roberts.\u201d But Romney told CBS News this past summer that Roberts made \u201cpolitical considerations\u201d in authoring the health care ruling. The Republican nominee supplemented his thoughts on the kinds of judges he would appoint: \u201cI\u2019d look for individuals who have the intelligence and believe in following the Constitution.\u201d Supreme Court possibilities if Romney is elected Wydra said the decision on health care \u201cwas sort of a microcosm of the philosophies that are frankly at a crossroads\u201d at the court. \u201cAnd if President Obama gets to nominate one or more justices in his next term, that could solidify the approach of the majority in the Affordable Care Act, which gives the national government the power to solve national problems.\u201d Unofficial favorites A dynamic California politician and a low-key Washington lawyer have emerged as unofficial favorites for any high court vacancy in the next four years. CNN talked with nearly a dozen sources close to both the Romney and Obama campaigns. For the president\u2019s backers, one name is repeatedly mentioned: Kamala Harris, the Golden State\u2019s elected attorney general. At 48, the part Asian, part African-American woman has been praised for her political savvy, ethnic background, telegenic personality, law enforcement credentials, and early support of Obama\u2019s 2008 candidacy. Navarrette: Why Latinos are key to election \u201cIf Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg does retire, or President Obama gets another appointment, I do think Kamala Harris is the most likely to be put on,\u201d said Goldstein, who generated buzz when he analyzed Harris at length eight months ago in his well-respected legal blog. \u201cThe California attorney general has the most political experience, which is really missing on the court right now. She\u2019s diverse, she\u2019s young \u2013 I think kind of a female Barack Obama in some sense.\u201d Harris declined to speculate about a possible move to Washington. For Romney, his legal advisers point to Paul Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general, as the kind of reliable, articulate conservative justice they think the Republican nominee would like. Despite no judicial experience, the quietly self-assured 46-year-old Iowa native has earned praise as a dazzling attorney arguing a range of big cases before the high court\u2013 including health care and immigration reform. Some conservative legal advocates want more assurances of Clement\u2019s conservative bona fides, hoping he and other young Republican lawyers would first be named to a federal appeals court seat \u2013 a stepping stone perhaps to the high court. \u201cClearly he\u2019s a brilliant man. He\u2019s clearly a wonderful [oral] advocate,\u201d said Severino. \u201cBut I think particularly for a Supreme Court spot, you\u2019re going to want to see somebody who has judicial experience, to see how they actually perform as a judge. \u2026 But certainly, I could see him being in a lower court position so that he would have the chance to build that experience and that record and then be in a place further down the line when another opening comes up.\u201d Clement was modest about the speculation. \u201cI think service on the bench is a great form of public service; I wouldn\u2019t want to necessarily rule it out,\u201d he told CNN exclusively in March. \u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019m a big believer in that you sort of have to do the job that you currently have and you can\u2019t really worry about what you might do next.\u201d A number of other potential top Romney picks are already relatively young federal judges, thanks to a deep conservative bench named by President George W. Bush, who made those judicial choices a top priority. Next to retire As for which justice would be next to retire, that remains one of the last best-kept secrets. Ginsburg, who turns 80 next March, is the oldest, and has previous health problems. But she has publicly stated her desire to stay on the court for a few more years if possible. If Obama is re-elected and if Ginsburg were to step down, the balance on the power on the court would likely not shift: the president would ostensibly be replacing one liberal with another. Conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are both 76, and their nominated replacements would be more closely scrutinized and debated, especially if Obama were to be the one making one or both choices. Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal, turned 74 last month. Justice Clarence Thomas is 64, Alito is 62, while Roberts, Sotomayor, and Kagan are all in their 50s.

This week, we\u2019re focusing on social issues. See our full election coverage to find out more about where Republicans and Democrats stand, and voice your views on our Facebook app. CNN posed questions for readers via a Facebook app Click through the gallery to see responses to questions about social issues New questions will be posted on the app through Election Day The economy and global affairs will undoubtedly play key roles in the 2012 election, but many voters may also be watching for candidates\u2019 stances on more personal issues. CNN posed questions about several hot-button topics related to social issues, and Facebook users responded enthusiastically; some even got into feisty commenting debates. Health care, immigration and same-sex marriage were three of the most popular topics. The readers shared their thoughts via the I\u2019m Voting app, which asks potential voters how the president should handle key issues. This project, in partnership with Facebook, aims to increase voter engagement ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Click through the gallery for a look at respondents\u2019 views, broken down by demographics gleaned from Facebook profiles. Party and age divisions showed more variation than in last week\u2019s look at foreign policy views. But when looking at gender groups, as in frame 2, the pie slices stayed remarkably consistent. 1. Health care Question: \n            \n                Should Americans be required to have health insurance? Terence Madison: \u201cA heath care system that\u2019s for profit is BS. They are not there for you. It\u2019s about the board of directors and rather it\u2019s making money. To me, that\u2019s a dangerous system. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that federal law says that they must take you, only the rich would live long full lives. And it\u2019s that way now. Just not to the extreme it would be without that law. Health care should not be for money. It should be for the people.\u201d Patrick Frankovich: \u201cDoctors wouldn\u2019t go to college if it weren\u2019t to earn a good living. Forced insurance is bull. If Obamacare is such a great thing, why are Congress and the president not covered by it?\u201d 2. Immigration Question: Should states be able to enact tougher immigration laws than the federal government? Glenn Dickey: \u201cif the federal government won\u2019t enforce the existing laws, why not let the states control their own borders? After all, it is costing the states way too much to continue supporting undocumented immigrants and their families.\u201d Maritza Cristina Nunez: \u201cWe seem to forget our history and keep making the same mistake over and over again. During World War II, we sent hundreds of Japanese-Americans to concentration camps! Now we are doing the same to the undocumented immigrants, mainly the Latinos. I don\u2019t hear as much about the European Illegals. These undocumented aliens are the ones that make it possible for you and me to eat our vegetables. They do the jobs that we American deem beneath us. So please, instead of focusing on illegal immigrants, why don\u2019t we focus on repairing our economy? Let\u2019s put our priorities in order and remember that the immigrants were the ones that made this country great!\u201d 3. Same-sex marriage Question: \n            \n                Should same-sex couples be able to marry? Eric Maisel-Smithey: \u201cSame-sex (couples) should be able to marry and get the same rights as everyone else, regardless of what state you live in, period. It does not matter what goes on in anyone\u2019s bedroom but your own.\u201d Norman Copeland: \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t care for the term same-sex marriage. As a Christian, I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the definition of marriage to me. I do believe that those so inclined should have a right to a civil union or partnership, whatever, but that is not a marriage. I have gay friends and family members that I love very much, but I just can\u2019t go there. Let them sign a contract or whatever and have the rights to health care and insurance, or to a divorce like the rest of us, LOL. Just leave marriage alone!\u201d Other questions posed on the app were about gun control, gun laws and abortion. Each of these questions received numerous comments. It\u2019s important to note that \u2013 unlike in scientific polls \u2013 anyone from the online audience could respond. A relatively large percentage of respondents in the Facebook surveys identified themselves as Democrats. The breakdown (as of Wednesday) was 54% Democratic, 21% Republican and 25% independent. Compare those numbers with a 2008 national exit poll showing 39% Democratic, 32% Republican and 29% independent. In 2010, the breakdown was 35% Democratic, 35% Republican and 29% independent.

            "article_content": "Polls indicate Mitt Romney has lost his edge on the economy, which was supposed to be a strength Barack Obama leads in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, all expected to be contested states Pollster says electorate divided on whether the country is better off than four years ago Romney and his campaign say they're not concerned about the polls New polls in three swing states indicate President Barack Obama exceeding 50% support among likely voters and holding leads of nine to 12 points over Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Fueling those numbers, the four polls suggest that Romney has lost his edge on the economy, an issue on which the challenger has based his campaign. The new surveys come one day after another batch of battleground state polls also suggested Obama with the advantage. The fresh batch of polls in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, which together account for 67 electoral votes, were released by Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times and Franklin and Marshall College. Romney slams Obama's welfare policy Obama misspeaks, zings Romney Romney, Obama gun control stance Obama: Is Romney suggesting a new war? They were conducted after the release last week of secretly recorded clips from a May fundraiser during which Romney casts Obama supporters as dependent on government. The story dominated coverage of the race last week. Fresh polls give Obama the advantage in four crucial battlegrounds Voters in the three states questioned in the Quinnipiac survey said they saw Obama as better for handling the economy, health care, Medicare, national security, international crisis and immigration. Romney tied or edged ahead on dealing with the budget deficit. While Romney\u2019s distractions last week over his controversial remark about Obama supporters might influence these polls, the economy appears to be a key to the Democrat\u2019s increasing advantage. \u201cThe wide difference between the two candidates is not just a result of Romney\u2019s bad week. In Ohio and Florida, votes are basically split down the middle on whether the country and they and their families are worse or better off than they were four years ago,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \u201cIf voters don\u2019t think they are worse off, it is difficult to see them throwing out an incumbent whose personal ratings with voters remains quite high,\u201d Brown said. Why Romney is losing must-win Ohio \u201cThe president\u2019s strength results from the fact that for the first time in the entire campaign, he is seen as better able to fix the economy than is Romney, the issue that has been the Republican\u2019s calling card since the general election campaign began,\u201d Brown said. The economy remains the top issue for Americans when it comes to their vote for president. CNN Polling Center Romney says he\u2019s not worried about the new surveys. \u201cPolls go up and down, but frankly you\u2019re going to see the support that I need to become president on Election Day,\u201d Romney said Tuesday in an interview with CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta. Romney\u2019s political director also says he\u2019s not concerned. \u201cThe public polls are what the public polls are. I kind of hope the Obama campaign is basing their campaign on what the public polls say. We don\u2019t. We have confidence in our data and our metrics,\u201d Rich Beeson said Tuesday to reporters aboard the Romney campaign plane. \u201cI feel confident where we are in each one of our states. I have great faith in our data.\u201d As both Romney and Obama separately campaign throughout Ohio on Wednesday, the Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times poll indicates the president leading Romney 53%-43% among likely voters. The Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times is the fourth non-partisan, live-operator, survey to be conducted in Ohio over the past two weeks. A CNN Poll of Polls that averages all five surveys puts Obama at 51% and Romney at 44% among likely voters. Some partisan polling indicates a closer contest. CNN Electoral Map Ohio, with 18 electoral votes, is crucial to winning the White House. In modern times, no Republican has won the presidency without carrying the state. It put George W. Bush over the top in his 2004 re-election and Obama won it four years ago by five points. The Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey in Florida indicates the president at  53% and Romney at 44%. Five non-partisan, live-operator, polls have been conducted in the Sunshine State since mid month. A CNN Poll of Polls that averages all five surveys puts Obama at 50% and Romney at 45% among likely voters. As with Ohio, some partisan polling in Florida has the battle for the state\u2019s 29 electoral votes much closer. Florida is another state that Obama turned from red to blue four years ago, edging out McCain by three points. Some partisan polling indicates a closer contest. In Pennsylvania, the new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey puts the president at 54% and the former Massachusetts governor at 42%. And the Franklin and Marshall poll indicates Obama holding a 52%-43% advantage. The nine-point margin is just within the survey\u2019s sampling error for likely voters. Five non-partisan, live-operator polls have been conducted in the Keystone State over the past 2 1/2 weeks. A CNN Poll of Polls average of all the surveys puts Obama at 51% and Romney at 41%. George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 victory in the state was the last time a Republican carried Pennsylvania in a presidential election. But the state remained competitive in the successive cycles, until four years ago, when Obama carried Pennsylvania by 10 points. But two years ago in the midterms, the GOP won back the governor\u2019s office, a Senate seat and five House seats. This cycle, the state has seen little candidate traffic. Obama last visited Pennsylvania on July 6. Romney\u2019s last visit to the state was on July 17. The new round of polls come one week before the first presidential debate in Denver. The three presidential showdowns are Romney\u2019s best chance to try and change the numbers. But early voting is already underway in a handful of states, and Iowa becomes the first battleground state to begin early voting on Thursday.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. Reid says Romney still isn't coming clean on taxes Paul Ryan gets mixed reception at AARP event Ryan and President Obama accuse each other of being untruthful Obama says leadership means rejecting bad ideas President Barack Obama and GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan on Friday traded sharp criticism over health care reforms and Medicare, with each telling a leading advocacy group for senior citizens that the other was being untruthful. \u201cContrary to what you\u2019ve heard and what you may hear from subsequent speakers, Obamacare actually strengthened Medicare,\u201d the president told the AARP Liffe@50+ event, using the nickname for the 2010 Affordable Care Act that passed with no Republican support. In particular, he called the claim by Ryan and other Republicans that $716 billion is being cut from Medicare to fund the health care bill \u201csimply not true.\u201d Ryan spoke to the same event shortly afterward, saying that Obama\u2019s contention that the health care law strengthened Medicare was \u201cjust not true,\u201d adding that the legislation \u201cturned Medicare into a piggy bank for Obamacare.\u201d The debate over Medicare is a major issue in the November election campaign, especially in the vital battleground state of Florida with its large population of senior citizens. Ryan headed to Florida later Friday, while Obama campaigned in Virginia, Vice President Joe Biden spoke in New Hampshire and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney headed to Las Vegas. All four states are considered up-for-grabs in the election less than seven weeks away. In a separate development, Romney released details of his 2011 income tax return that showed he made $13.7 million last year and paid $1.94 million in federal taxes, giving him an effective tax rate of 14.1%, his campaign said. The majority of the candidate\u2019s income last year came from his investments, Brad Malt, the trustee of Romney\u2019s blind trust, said in a blog post. The Romneys gave just over $4 million to charity. In addition, the Romney campaign said his tax filings from 1990 to 2009 show that he and his wife paid 100% of the federal and state income taxes they owed and that their overall average annual effective federal tax rate was 20.2%. Romney has been criticized by Democrats and even some Republicans for not releasing more than two years worth of taxes. His wealth and investment industry background, as well as his father\u2019s decision to release a dozen years of tax records during his presidential run four decades ago, have only raised interest in Romney\u2019s returns. Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said in a statement the disclosure \u201ccontinues to mask Romney\u2019s true wealth\u201d and income from the private equity firm he once led, leaving the American people in the dark about critical details of his finances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called the new tax information insufficient. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is why he refuses to be straight with the American people about the choices he\u2019s made in his financial life,\u201d according to a statement from Reid, who previously created a stir when he alleged Romney paid no taxes in some years but refused to divulge the source of his accusation. \u201cWhen will the American people see the returns he filed before he was running for president?\u201d Reid asked. Obama responds to health care attacks In his appearance by satellite at the AARP event in New Orleans, Obama responded to specific attacks on the health care law by Ryan and other Republicans, declaring the 2010 measure cuts waste and fraud in Medicare, provides preventive care to keep people healthier and reduces prescription drug costs for seniors. Romney pivots after controversies distract campaign Savings come from \u201cusing the purchasing power of Medicare to say to doctors and hospitals and insurance companies: \u2018You guys need to work smarter,\u2019\u201d Obama said to applause. \u201cInstead of having five different tests that each of you is charging for, do one test and email it to everybody.\u201d Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, has proposed a partial privatization of the entitlement that would provide government subsidies to help senior citizens pay for coverage they would choose from a list of options. He defended the plan Friday in the face of a mixed reception. \u201cThe first step to a stronger Medicare is to repeal Obamacare because it represents the worst of both worlds,\u201d Ryan said to loud booing. He added: \u201cI had a feeling there\u2019d be mixed reaction so let me get into it .\u201d \u201cIt weakens Medicare for today\u2019s seniors and puts it at risk for the next generation,\u201d Ryan said, repeating the factually challenged claim of $716 billion in Medicare cuts and also targeting a panel created under the health care law charged with recommending ways to reach targeted savings starting in 2014. Ryan also took a swipe at Obama\u2019s re-election slogan of \u201cForward,\u201d saying it means \u201cForward into a future where seniors are denied the care they earned because a bureaucrat decided it wasn\u2019t worth the money.\u201d In his remarks, Obama argued that Medicare savings come from \u201cusing the purchasing power of Medicare to say to doctors and hospitals and insurance companies: \u2018You guys need to work smarter.\u201d \u201cInstead of having five different tests that each of you is charging for, do one test and email it to everybody,\u201d he said to applause. With polls showing Romney unable to overtake Obama with less than seven weeks to go until the November election, GOP infighting  is showing a rising frustration over the candidate\u2019s campaign against a president saddled by high unemployment and a sluggish economy. New figures show Obama and his allies raised nearly $85 million in August, outpacing Romney\u2019s haul in the month that included both parties\u2019 national conventions. Obama defends record on immigration at Univision forum In Wisconsin, conservative candidate Tommy Thompson put some of the blame for his slipping poll numbers on the Romney campaign and conservative commentators, including former GOP speechwriter Peggy Noonan, have depicted the Romney team as floundering. \u201cStop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring,\u201d Ann Romney said of her husband\u2019s critics in an interview on Thursday with Radio Iowa. Romney tweaked his campaign strategy twice this week in response to controversies that distracted from his main message challenging Obama\u2019s record as president. On Thursday, he kept up attacks on Obama over a 1998 comment regarding redistribution of wealth, and also claimed the president had given up on changing Washington. The Obama camp fired back that the criticism was off base. At the AARP event Friday, Obama said the Ryan proposal to reform Medicare would make it a voucher program that shifts health care costs to senior citizens. He noted that AARP supported the 2010 health care reform act and opposed Ryan\u2019s Medicare proposal. \u201cThey know that a voucher program is not going to be a good deal,\u201d Obama said. Ryan, however, denied it was a voucher program and insisted that the idea originated in Democratic proposals of the past. \u201cThis financial support system is designed to guarantee that seniors can always afford Medicare coverage \u2013 no exceptions,\u201d he said to some applause. Members of AARP \u2013 a nonprofit organization and a powerful lobbying group that boasts of having more than 37 million members \u2013 submitted questions to the nominees on their website. Tough stretch for Romney Romney is coming off a tough stretch in the weeks before the three presidential debates in October. Last week, the Romney campaign struggled in its initial response to anti-American violence in Libya and Egypt. Then a left-leaning magazine released secretly recorded clips of Romney speaking at a May fund-raiser in which he said 47% of Americans depended on government help, saw themselves as victims and won\u2019t support him. Under criticism for the comments at the fund-raiser, Romney stuck by them and rallied some conservative commentators to his side by emphasizing his message on his allegation that Obama\u2019s polices increased public dependency on government. Clinton on the \u201947 percent\u2019 comments and the debates In particular, they accused Obama of favoring wealth redistribution \u2013 code for socialism among conservatives \u2013 based on the 1998 video of the president when he was a state senator in Illinois. \u201cI think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution \u2013 because I actually believe in some redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody\u2019s got a shot,\u201d Obama says in the clip, posted Tuesday on the conservative Drudge Report website. The White House on Wednesday characterized the GOP attacks over the redistribution comment as an effort to divert attention from Romney\u2019s remarks at the May fundraiser. Romney also took aim at Obama\u2019s comment on Thursday at a Univision \u201cMeet the Candidates\u201d forum in which the president said he was unable to change Washington from within. House Speaker John Boehner continued the Romney attack line on Friday, saying Obama and congressional Democrats lacked the leadership qualities necessary to change the culture of partisan divide and legislative gridlock. \u201cIt takes courage, it takes determination and it takes sincerity, and it\u2019s called leadership,\u201d Boehner told reporters. Asked about the inability to work out compromises with Republicans on deficit reduction and other major issues, Obama blamed GOP intransigence and said he was being a leader by rejecting what he called \u201cbad ideas.\u201d He noted that his proposals, including the health care reform measure opposed by every Republican, included some ideas with GOP origins. \u201cObamacare owes a debt to what was done in Massachusetts by my opponent, Mr. Romney, even though sometimes he denies it,\u201d the president said in a jab at his challenger, who passed a similar plan while governor of the state but now vows to repeal the federal version. \u201cThe one thing I won\u2019t do though is go along with bad ideas that are not helping the middle class,\u201d Obama said to applause, adding: \u201cIf I hear the only way Republicans in Congress are willing to move forward is to voucherize Medicare, I\u2019ll say no.\u201d Polls: GOP Senate takeover might be tougher CNN\u2019s Shawna Shepherd, Paul Steinhauser, Dana Davidsen, Peter Hamby and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Fresh polling suggests Democrats in some crucial contests are on the rise Democrats defending most of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs in November Republicans confident but say it's way too early to make predictions President Barack Obama may be helping Democratic candidates in some Senate contests It gets second billing to the race for the White House, but the battle for control of the Senate is just as important and fresh polling suggests Democrats in some crucial contests are on the rise. A Republican tidal wave in the 2010 midterms gave the GOP control of the House of Representatives. They also reduced their deficit in the Senate and set their sights on retaking that chamber this year. Democrats currently control the Senate, 53-47 \u2013 down from 59-41 before the midterms \u2013 but they\u2019re defending 23 (21 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party) of the 33 seats up for grabs in November. While the GOP still has a very good chance of winning control, which they lost in the 2006 midterms, their path to victory might be getting a bit more difficult. Sen. candidates steer clear of Romney Week in Politics: September 14 - 21 \u201cDemocrats are cautiously optimistic. We inherited a difficult map but Republican missteps and strong Democratic campaigns have made a major difference,\u201d Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Communications Director Matt Canter told CNN. \u201cThere is still a long way to go but right now the tide is certainly moving in our favor. Obama defends record on immigration at Univision forum Republicans remain confident but agree that it\u2019s way too early to be making predictions. \u201cThe Senate Democrats\u2019 reckless and failed leadership on the economy has put them on defense in races across the country and Republicans are positioned to hold them accountable on Election Day,\u201d Brian Walsh, Canter\u2019s counterpart at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said. \u201cBut seven weeks is an eternity in politics and no one in either party should be taking anything for granted.\u201d Let\u2019s start with Massachusetts, one of the most expensive and closely watched Senate contests this cycle. Polls over the past year suggested that the marquee matchup between incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown and Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren was a dead heat. That changed earlier this week with Warren\u2019s numbers rising in two new surveys of likely voters in the Bay State. Warren held a 48%-44% margin over Brown in a Suffolk University/7News poll and a 50%-44% advantage in a Western New England University survey. Both margins are within the polls\u2019 sampling errors. Warren\u2019s well received speech earlier this month at the Democratic convention may have contributed to her rise in the surveys. But another new poll, by UMass Lowell/Boston Herald, gives Brown a 49%-45% edge. Before launching her campaign for the Senate last year, Warren was best known as a top adviser to President Barack Obama, a role in which she was integral to the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created as part of the 2010 financial reform law. Brown was a state lawmaker who scored an upset victory in a January 2010 special election to fill the final 2 1/2 years of the term of the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. Brown and Warren faced off Thursday in the first of four debates leading up to the election. Romney pivots after controversies distract campaign There was also a debate on Thursday in another high-profile and expensive Senate race in Virginia. It\u2019s a similar story as Massachusetts, with polls over the past year showing a tie between the Democrat, former Gov. Tim Kaine (who most recently served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee) and former Gov. George Allen, who\u2019s trying to win back the Senate seat he lost in the 2006 election to Democrat Jim Webb, who decided against running for re-election. But a pair of polls out this week from The Washington Post and from Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times indicate Kaine with leads of seven and eight points. A new Fox News poll has it closer, with Kaine holding a four-point edge. Two Democratic incumbents facing what were thought to be tough re-elections are seeing good news in the latest polling. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio holds a seven-point lead over Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandell, the GOP candidate, in two surveys over the past two weeks. And Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida holds 14-point leads over Rep. Connie Mack Jr. in two surveys released over the same span. The polling indicates that both Brown and Nelson so far are holding their own against of flood of attack ads put up by pro-Republican independent groups. In Wisconsin, where four-term Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl is retiring, a new poll suggests that Rep. Tammy Baldwin, who\u2019s trying to keep the seat in party hands, is up nine points over former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Cabinet. But another survey indicates the race tied at 47% each. And some new polling suggests that Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is building a lead as she faces off against former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, the Republican candidate. Meanwhile Democratic chances in Senate contests in Indiana and North Dakota also seem to be on the rise, while Republican chances of grabbing back a seat in traditionally blue Connecticut seem much better now than just a few weeks ago. Brown hits Warren over claim of Native American heritage in first debate The race for the White House influences down-ballot races, and President Barack Obama may be helping Democratic candidates in Senate contests in some battleground states. Thompson blamed his numbers, in part, on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s rocky campaign. \u201cThe presidential thing is bound to have an impact on every election,\u201d Thompson told Madison television station WKOW. \u201cYou know, whether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican, if your standard-bearer for the presidency is not doing well, it\u2019s going to reflect on the down-ballot.\u201d But while the face-off between Obama and Romney greatly impacts the other contests, the candidates will determine them. \u201cCandidates and campaigns matter,\u201d says Jessica Taylor, senior analyst and reporter for the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cSeveral candidates are still going to need to run significantly ahead of their party\u2019s presidential nominee in more hostile states, and while that playing field may level out closer to Election Day, candidates such as Joe Donnelly (Democrat in Indiana), Heidi Heitkamp (Democrat in North Dakota) and Linda McMahon (Republican in Connecticut) have been running strong campaigns and appear to be benefiting from weaknesses by their opponents.\u201d With 6 1/2 weeks to go, Democrats may be breathing a little bit easier.

            "article_content": "For the second time this week, Mitt Romney tweaks his campaign strategy The shifts follow controversies that GOP critics say derailed his main message Supporters want Romney to focus the election on President Obama's record Obama seeks to frame the vote as a choice between differing visions Republican challenger Mitt Romney tweaked his campaign strategy twice this week in an attempt to refocus the election debate on President Barack Obama\u2019s record after controversial remarks that brought criticism from both his Democratic opponent and some GOP colleagues. Unable to overtake Obama less than seven weeks from Election Day, the former Massachusetts governor and his campaign team have been lambasted by some Republicans for veering away from messaging focused on what they call the president\u2019s failed policies and broken promises. Former GOP speechwriter Peggy Noonan urged a campaign intervention in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, while conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Romney needed to press more flesh in battleground states. Romney, Obama look to advantages as campaign rolls on \u201cI cannot think of one campaign that has not had a rough patch like this, including then Sen. Obama\u2019s campaign back in 2008,\u201d said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, adding that Republicans are nervous about Romney\u2019s chances as well as possible \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to GOP candidates in Senate and House races. Bob McDonnell: 'Not at all discouraged' Byers: Romney campaign in 'crisis mode' Obama, Romney Middle East peace stance McCain: Romney cares about every American Now the Republican intelligentsia and the Romney campaign agree the candidate must return to an economy themed message before the first presidential debate on October 3, followed two days later by the monthly jobs report, King said Wednesday. \u201cAnybody who thinks the Romney campaign is in trouble thinks that\u2019s the pivot point, that they have to execute this perfectly,\u201d he added. The Romney team has struggled to build momentum after a grueling primary race, stymied at times by self-inflicted wounds that have helped fuel a Democratic depiction of the multimillionaire former businessman as being out-of-touch with working-class Americans. Boehner says presidential campaigns \u2018get off message\u2019 Last week, Romney came under fire for an initially incorrect statement that criticized the Obama administration in the aftermath of assaults on U.S. diplomatic compounds in Egypt and Libya on the  anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Issued before it was known that the Libyan attack by armed militants killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, Romney complained about how the American embassy in Egypt responded, even though the embassy statement he referenced came out before the assault took place. Eager to move on, his campaign team signaled reporters that Romney would shift back to economic issues starting Monday and promised more details on specific policies. Then a video surfaced of Romney complaining at a private fundraiser in May that nearly half of Americans are dependent on government handouts and won\u2019t vote for him. That prompted another pivot Wednesday, with the campaign attacking Obama for advocating redistribution \u2013 code to conservatives for socialist policies. Romney\u2019s remarks: Huge mistake or plain truth? CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said Romney had little choice after his May comments went public to build on the premise of his statement \u2013 that the Obama economy fostered greater dependency on government. \u201cI think what you see in the Romney campaign is kind of a recalibration, because you can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle this late in the campaign,\u201d Borger said Wednesday. \u201cSo you might as well make the best of it. \u201c On Thursday, the Republican establishment lined up behind the candidate. More than 30 Republicans took to the Senate floor in a series of coordinated speeches that attacked what they called failed leadership by the president and Senate Democrats. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, acknowledged to reporters that presidential campaigns get \u201coff message,\u201d but sidestepped questions about Romney\u2019s comments. \u201cEverybody is going to try to make this election about everything other than what it is,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThe American people are asking the question, where are the jobs? And so the focus is on jobs.\u201d Meanwhile, the Romney campaign announced the candidate will pick up the pace of his campaign next week with a bus tour of Ohio, one of the most important battleground states in the election. The bus tour follows a light week in which Romney held two public rallies through Wednesday, which prompted Graham and others to say he needed to be more visible in swing states that will decide the outcome in November. The changes followed GOP hand-wringing Wednesday over the Romney comments from the May fund-raiser, as Republicans sought to clarify what the candidate meant to say in remarks that he admitted were \u201cnot elegantly stated.\u201d \u201cThere are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\u201d Romney said in a clip from the event first posted online on Monday. \u201cThere are 47% who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.\u201d He also said he would \u201cnever convince\u201d the 47% of Americans who pay no federal income tax \u201cthat they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d \u201cI think what he was saying is the fact that over the last four years the government is playing a bigger and bigger role in our lives because the economy is weaker and weaker and he wants to turn that around,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a close Romney ally who is helping him prepare for next month\u2019s debates. Ryan gives House GOP a \u2018pep talk\u2019 \u201cI know him personally and I know that he does care,\u201d said Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Other GOP legislators were less charitable. \u201cThe comments are very unfortunate,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. \u201cIt clearly isn\u2019t helpful and it\u2019s surprising that a disciplined candidate would make those kind of comments.\u201d Three GOP Senate candidates in tough races this fall have distanced themselves from Romney\u2019s comments. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, told CNN on Wednesday that he had \u201ca very different view of the world\u201d than what Romney expressed. \u201cAs a United States senator, I think I represent everybody, and I think every vote is important,\u201d Heller said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t write off anybody.\u201d A day earlier, Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts and GOP candidate Linda McMahon of Connecticut released campaign statements denouncing Romney\u2019s comments. In an op-ed published Wednesday in USA Today, Romney refused to step back from the comments. Romney\u2019s \u2018dependent\u2019 voters: Seniors on benefits \u201cUnder President Obama, we have a stagnant economy that fosters government dependency,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cMy policies will create a growing economy that fosters upward mobility.\u201d He conceded that \u201cgovernment has a role to play here,\u201d but said Obama is offering the wrong kind of help to people struggling in a still-weak economy. Some conservatives applauded Romney for stating what they called a truth America needs to hear. Radio host Rush Limbaugh said it \u201ccould be the opportunity for Romney and for that campaign to finally take the gloves off and take the fear off and just start explaining conservatism, start explaining liberty to people and what it means, and explain that they don\u2019t have to be in that 47 percent.\u201d Also Wednesday, Romney and his campaign mounted their counter-offensive that focused on comments by Obama in 1998, when he was a state senator in Illinois, suggesting better ways to make government more effective. \u201cI think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution - because I actually believe in some redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody\u2019s got a shot,\u201d Obama is heard saying in an audio clip that first emerged Tuesday on the conservative Drudge Report website. King: Revived auto industry gives Obama advantage in Michigan Romney later sought to link Obama\u2019s 1998 comments to the president\u2019s \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d remark in July in reference to government help for business development. \u201cThis idea of redistribution follows from the idea that if you have a business you didn\u2019t build it, someone else did that,\u201d Romney told a fundraiser in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s the same concept. That see, government is responsible for everything that\u2019s going on here, and therefore government can take and give as it chooses.\u201d At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney characterized the Romney attack line as an effort to divert attention from Romney\u2019s controversial remarks. Obama believed in 1998 and still believes that \u201cthere are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot, if they work hard,\u201d Carney said \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t believe \u2013 as some apparently do \u2013 that any student who looks for a government-backed loan is looking for a handout or that a senior citizen receiving Social Security is a freeloader or a combat veteran not paying taxes is a victim,\u201d Carney continued, adding: \u201cWhen a campaign is having a bad day or a bad week or some might say a bad month \u2026 you sometimes witness an effort that seems desperate to change the subject.\u201d Opinion: Real conservatives can say they\u2019re sorry With the presidential campaign heading into the final stretch, the competition over framing the message has become fierce Obama and his team face consistent GOP attacks on the weak economic recovery and continued high unemployment and rising federal deficits and debt. In response, the president and his campaign say Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin back policies that favor the wealthy over the middle class and seek to return to failed strategies of the past. The Republican split over Romney\u2019s campaign performance reflects a longstanding party divide between fiscal conservatives \u2013 who favor more moderate social policies to attract moderate and independent voters \u2013 versus social conservatives unwilling to yield on issues such as abortion, gay marriage and illegal immigration. 4,000 millionaires in Romney\u2019s \u201947%\u2019 David Frum, a former GOP presidential aide who now is contributing editor at the \u201cDaily Beast\u201d and \u201cNewsweek\u201d as well as a CNN contributor, said Romney\u2019s fundraiser comments in May reflected the pressure that the party\u2019s conservative base has put on him going back to the primary campaign. \u201cWhat happened to him in that crowd was he began to channel the talk of the conservative world,\u201d Frum said, adding that the conservative pressure has \u201creshaped Romney away from his own instincts into someone who can be their robot or repeat their things.\u201d Ron Brownstein, CNN\u2019s senior political analyst and editorial director at the National Journal, said Romney embraced the government dependence message because it was a \u201cconstruct that the Republicans want to drive\u201d  that \u201cDemocrats are taking from the productive class to giving it to people who don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cThat is their attempt to kind of respond to the argument that Romney favors the rich,\u201d Brownstein said, noting that polling shows voters believe the Democratic accusation more than the Republican argument that Obama favors the poor.

            "article_content": "Obama says stalling of immigration reform was \"not for lack of trying\" Recent polls have showed President Obama leading among Latino registered voters Latinos are considered a crucial bloc for the November election The forum comes after co-host criticizes lack of Latino moderator in upcoming debates The immigration debate took center stage Thursday as U.S. President Barack Obama fielded questions in a forum broadcast live online by the Spanish-language Univision network. \u201cI want you to acknowledge that you did not keep your promise,\u201d co-host Jorge Ramos said in Spanish, noting that the president didn\u2019t deliver on his 2008 campaign pledge to push immigration reform during the first year of his term. Obama said the first year of his term was consumed by efforts to help the economy and stop the country from going into another Great Depression. Battling over the Latino vote Pres. Obama fights for the Latino Vote Julian Castro compared to young Obama And Republican political opponents, he said, kept many significant immigration measures from getting off the ground. For immigrants, \u2018deferred status\u2019 still means no federal health insurance \u201cI am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we didn\u2019t get it done,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I did not make a promise that I would get everything done 100% when I was elected as president. What I promised was that I would work every single day as hard as I can to make sure that everybody in this country regardless of who they are, what they look like, where they come from, that they would have a fair shot at the American dream. And that promise I\u2019ve kept.\u201d Asked whether his move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants was politically motivated by a desire to win the Latino vote, Obama said, \u201cI think if you look at the polls, I was winning the Latino vote before that. \u201cI did this because I met young people all across the country, wonderful kids who sometimes were valedictorians, were participating in the community, had aspirations to go to college, some were serving in our military. \u2026 There\u2019s no way you would think it was fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation,\u201d he said. After answering a series of Spanish questions about topics ranging from teacher strikes to Mexico\u2019s drug war, Obama brought up the topic again at the end of the forum. Asked by Ramos to identify his biggest failure, Obama offered a quick response. \u201cJorge, as you remind me, my biggest failure is that we haven\u2019t gotten comprehensive immigration reform done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not for lack of trying or desire.\u201d The hourlong forum, co-sponsored by Facebook, was broadcast live online in Spanish and English on Thursday afternoon and was scheduled to air on Univision later Thursday night. On the campaign trail, both Obama and Republican challenger Gov. Mitt Romney have discussed immigration in their efforts to woo Latino voters, considered a key demographic in the November election. Obama handily won the Latino vote in 2008 over Republican Sen. John McCain, and recent polls have showed Obama leading Romney among Latino registered voters. Romney steps up effort to woo Latino voters in Univision forum The impreMedia/Latino Decisions weekly tracking poll reported Monday that Obama held a 68% to 26% advantage over Romney among Hispanics. A Gallup poll conducted partially before and partially after the Republican National Convention at the end of August said Obama leads Romney among Latino registered voters 64% to 27%. But Latino leaders have criticized the president for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency\u2019s history. Some Latino leaders have also criticized the president for not moving quickly enough on immigration reform at the beginning of his presidency. Obama: \u2018I need a dance partner on immigration reform\u2019 Politicians across party lines have vowed to fix what they argue is the nation\u2019s broken immigration system. But it\u2019s unclear what shape so-called comprehensive immigration reform could take \u2013 particularly in a politically divided Congress. Many immigrant rights groups have proposed creating a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d that would give millions of illegal immigrants an opportunity to become legal residents. Critics have called such proposals unfair offers of amnesty to lawbreakers. Measures aimed at dealing with the thorny issue \u2013 including the DREAM act, proposed by Democrats and backed by Obama \u2013 have not gained enough support to pass Congress despite several attempts. The Obama administration has said its deferred action policy \u2013 which allows people younger than 30 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, to apply for a two-year deferral from deportation \u2013 is a temporary measure aimed at addressing a problem that requires a permanent solution. During the primary campaign, Romney said he opposed the DREAM Act, but also called for an unspecified GOP version that has yet to emerge from the party or his campaign. On Thursday, Obama said he had never wavered in his support for immigration reform and criticized Romney\u2019s stance on the topic. \u201cThe issue here for voters is whose vision best represents the aspirations, not just of the Latino community, but of all Americans who believe that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And that candidate I believe is talking to you right now,\u201d he said as the audience at the University of Miami cheered. Romney spoke for about 35 minutes in another \u201cMeet the Candidates\u201d forum hosted by Univision on Wednesday. The events come weeks after Ramos criticized the Commission on Presidential Debates for not picking a Latino debate moderator. \u201cI think that they should have noticed that this country is changing very rapidly,\u201d Ramos told CNN in August. \u201cMinorities, for instance, surpass whites in U.S. births, and those changes simply are not reflected. I really can\u2019t believe why they didn\u2019t choose a member of a minority group to be part of at least one debate, and I really can\u2019t understand why (the commission didn\u2019t pick) a journalist from the fastest (growing) voting block in the country, the Latinos.\u201d The bipartisan commission that organizes presidential debates announced the moderators last month. PBS\u2019 Jim Lehrer will host the first debate on October 3 in Denver. Candy Crowley, CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent and host of \u201cState of the Union,\u201d will host the second debate on October 16 in Hempstead, New York, at Hofstra University. And CBS\u2019 Bob Schieffer will host an October 22 debate in Boca Raton, Florida.

NEW: Mitt Romney tells a Latino group that President Obama failed them Obama says Romney doesn't \"walk the walk\" on China The Obama administration files a trade complaint against China Romney calls the trade complaint a campaign stunt President Barack Obama campaigned in America\u2019s car country on Monday after his administration filed a trade complaint against China\u2019s auto industry subsidies, while Republican challenger Mitt Romney complained the move was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d Romney spoke Monday to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in his attempt to diminish the president\u2019s advantage with the Latino vote, a traditionally Democratic demographic that strongly supported Obama in 2008. MYB: Obama to file China trade complaint With the November election just over seven weeks away, Obama seeks to maintain the momentum of a perceived \u201cbounce\u201d in support following this month\u2019s Democratic National Convention while Romney wants to gain ground on his rival ahead of the three presidential debates next month. Romney makes push for Hispanic voters In speeches at Eden Park in Cincinnati and Schiller Park in Columbus, Obama focused on the auto sector that, according to industry research, supports almost 800,000 jobs in Ohio. The president touted both the auto industry bailout from his first year in office, noting Romney at the time called for letting Detroit go bankrupt on its own, and his administration\u2019s new complaint with the World Trade Organization that accuses China of providing $1 billion in illegal subsidies to auto and auto parts exporters between 2009 and 2011. \u201cYou can talk a good game, but I like to walk the walk, not just talk the talk,\u201d Obama said of Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of backing companies that outsourced U.S. jobs to China while a private equity investor. iReport: \u2018I\u2019m the 47%, but you\u2019re wrong, Romney\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ve brought more trade cases against China in one term than the previous administration did in two \u2013 and every case we\u2019ve brought that\u2019s been decided, we\u2019ve won,\u201d Obama continued in Cincinnati, adding that the subsidies being challenged \u201cdirectly harm working men and women on the assembly line in Ohio and Michigan and across the Midwest.\u201d His voice rising to a shout, Obama said to cheers: \u201cIt\u2019s not right; it\u2019s against the rules; and we will not let it stand.\u201d Critics of U.S. trade policy say a tougher line with China is necessary. Romney labeled the administration\u2019s move an election-year stunt in comparison to what he called his own consistent criticism of China as an unfair trade partner. \u201cThe president may think that announcing new trade lawsuits less than two months from the election will distract from his record, but American businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better,\u201d Romney told the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. In an earlier statement, Romney said Obama \u201chas spent 43 months failing to confront China\u2019s unfair trade practices.\u201d Romney ads paint plans to help middle class in broad strokes The WTO is the global organization that referees trade disputes between nations. In the last decade, the Chinese auto industry has grown rapidly as the nation\u2019s expanding middle class made the country the world\u2019s largest market for car purchases, with General Motors now selling more cars in China than in the United States. According to White House estimates, up to 60% of China\u2019s auto parts exporters benefit from subsidies, making it hard for American companies to compete. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement on Monday that China agreed when it joined the WTO in 2001 to eliminate the kind of export subsidies targeted by the new U.S. complaint. Obama\u2019s mixed record on trade Ohio is considered one of the most important battleground states of the November election, offering 18 electoral votes and the historical footnote that no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying it. In his speech to the Hispanic businessmen, Romney touched on economic and education issues important to Latino communities. Obama\u2019s policies made things worse for Hispanic Americans, he said, citing higher unemployment and increased poverty compared to when the president took office. \u201cNo one is exempt from the pain of this economy, but the Hispanic community has been particularly hard hit,\u201d Romney said. He offered some new details on his budget-cutting plans, saying he would save $500 billion by reducing government employment by 10% through attrition while combining agencies and departments to reduce overhead and linking government compensation to private sector levels. Romney also promised to \u201cpermanently fix our immigration system,\u201d the latest in a series of attempts to appeal to Hispanic voters despite polls showing the Republican presidential nominee faces a sizable deficit among the key voting group. Opinion: Can Romney connect with Latino voters? Obama leads Romney among Latino registered voters by 64%-27%, according to a recent Gallup poll. Later this week, both candidates will separately answer questions from the Spanish-language television network Univision as part of outreach to Hispanic voters. Romney has struggled in the past to frame his positions on immigration in ways that appeal to Hispanic voters as well as the conservative base of the Republican Party. On Monday, he repeated past support for requiring employers to verify the legal status of workers and to simplify immigration laws while strengthening border security. He also reiterated his opposition to amnesty \u2013 a code word for the DREAM Act proposed by Democrats and backed by Obama that would provide a path to legal status for children of illegal immigrants brought to America by their parents. At the same time, he expressed support for giving permanent residency to those who served in the military or obtained an advanced degree, and blasted Obama for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise of immigration reform. \u201cDespite his party having majorities in both house of Congress, super majorities, the president never even offered up a bill,\u201d Romney said. \u201cLike so many issues confronting our nation, when it comes to immigration, politics have been put ahead of people for too long.\u201d At a Republican presidential candidate debate in January, Romney said he favored a system of \u201cself-deportation,\u201d a policy that involves making economic conditions so difficult for undocumented workers that they choose to leave the country to find better opportunities. That stance was derided by Democrats and his Republican rivals. Romney retools campaign message Obama\u2019s campaign released a web video on Monday denouncing Romney\u2019s \u201cExtreme Makeover, Latino Edition,\u201d claiming the candidate was attempting to \u201coverhaul his positions and slow his sharply declining popularity in the Latino community.\u201d \u201cCan Romney cover up his belief in self-deportation as an immigration solution with a bold new wallpaper choice?\u201d Team Obama asks. \u201cWill a new window treatment help disguise his cuts to education and college scholarships? If he does something amazing with spackle, will people forget he\u2019s promised over and over again to repeal Obamacare on day one - denying millions of Latinos comprehensive health care coverage? And on his promise to veto the DREAM Act. \u2026 well, duct tape can fix everything, can\u2019t it?\u201d On another issue, a new poll on Monday showed that more respondents favored Obama over Romney on their handling of anti-American unrest in Arab world countries. The Pew Research Center survey showed that 45% approved of Obama\u2019s handling of the attacks on U.S. embassies and diplomatic compounds while 36% disapproved, compared to 26% approving Romney\u2019s actions while 48% disapproved. Meanwhile, a pair of television ads released Monday by the Romney campaign focused on the nation\u2019s economy, which voters identify as their main issue of concern. In the first ad, Romney speaks interview-style about proposals he claims will help bolster earnings for middle income Americans and ultimately create 12 million new jobs before the end of a potential first term. The ad generally repeats Romney\u2019s main campaign themes on the economy without offering new details. The second ad on Monday features a narrator listing problems with the nation\u2019s economy since Obama took office. \u201cBarack Obama: More spending, more debt, failing American families,\u201d the ad says.

Clinton: Obama's committed to cooperation Fluke on Obama: 'We need him' Claim: Obama saved the auto industry Clinton's impact on the Obama campaign But some political observers make the case that\u00a0pushing a lot of promises was a necessity for an unproven freshman senator. \u201cHe really needed to prove himself to a lot of individual\u00a0Democratic constituencies,\u201d said Bill Adair, the creator and editor of PolitiFact, an online site best known for rating the truth in campaign advertisements.\u00a0 \u201cHe made dozens and dozens of small but very narrow promises.\u201d PolitiFact evaluated 508 promises and concluded that the president has kept 37% of them, compromised on 14% of them, has broken 16% of them, has gotten stalled on 10% of them and 22% are still \u201cin the works.\u201d It\u2019s all detailed in the online site\u2019s Obameter scorecard. One big stumble came soon after the president took office.\u00a0 During an interview on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Obama had said he intended to \u201cclose Guantanamo\u201d and vowed to \u201cfollow through on that.\u201d But legal hurdles and resistance in Congress neutralized his executive order to close the detention facility within a year. Obama signs order to close Guantanamo Bay facility Another promise that ran into a wall on Capitol Hill was the vow to repeal Bush-era tax cuts for the very rich. And with homeowners\u00a0trying to recover from a crippling mortgage crisis, especially in states such as Nevada and Florida, a promised $10 billion dollar foreclosure prevention fund never materialized. \u201cHe made some really sweeping promises about changing the culture of Washington, about bringing the parties together, about being more transparent in how he runs the White House,\u201d Adair said. \u201cHe ran into trouble there. There\u2019s been a real realization on the part of the White House that some of the things he said during the 2008 campaign were just not realistic given the way Washington really works.\u201d Immigration reform advocates urge Obama to take action The very long list goes on: No comprehensive immigration reform. No cap and trade system that regulates pollution emissions. Some of these broken promises provide critics with plenty of fodder to argue he has been ineffective. But the White House views his bucket of promises as half-full. Health care reform. Check. Auto industry bailout. Check. \u201cDon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell,\u201d the policy that banned openly gays and lesbians from serving in the military, repealed. Check. Repeal of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 seen as \u2018tipping point\u2019 in gay rights movement The Obameter Scorecard also gives the president a thumbs up on national security. In 2008 while visiting Jordan, the president vowed to end the war in Iraq. \u201cMy goal is to no longer have U.S. troops engaged in combat in Iraq.\u201d That promise was fulfilled in December. Added to that is that the conflict in Afghanistan is winding down and the world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden, is dead. \u201cThe death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation\u2019s effort to defeat al Qaeda\u201d the president said as he broke the news in a hastily arranged late-night Sunday address to the nation in May 2011. Between now and Election Day, it\u2019s possible other promises stuck in the works could go either way, although campaigning has consumed much of the oxygen. Adair said there is plenty of blame to go around. Congress has created some impassable barriers but at the same time, he argues other promises were \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d\u00a0that the president could have accomplished through executive action but so far hasn\u2019t delivered.

            "article_content": "Romney's speech was more about Obama than himself Republican presidential candidate made clear election is referendum on economy Rubio's speech makes him 2016 GOP front-runner should Romney lose Jeb Bush makes clear he's had enough bashing of his brother Mitt Romney accepted the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for the presidency on Thursday night, culminating a convention shortened to three days by Tropical Storm Isaac. The closing image from the convention\u2019s final night was Romney with running mate Paul Ryan surrounded by their families and showered with balloons. But the lasting image might be Clint Eastwood speaking to an empty chair. Here are five things we learned Thursday: 1. Do we know more about Romney the man than we did before? Eastwood uses empty chair as prop at RNC Romney's entire RNC speech Eastwood: We own this country Romney reflects on growing up Mormon From an emotional video to a speech with more insight on his family, his faith and his career, Romney used the most important address of his life (yes, way overused, but true) to open up to Americans voters. \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t explain love. I don\u2019t know why it happens. I don\u2019t know why it endures the way it does. You know, at the very beginning, I sat with her, chatted with her, put my arm around her and something changed,\u201d Romney said, sharing his feelings for his wife, Ann, in a video that played before his address. Day Three at the Republican National Convention It was a rare display of emotion by the Republican presidential nominee. And in his speech, Romney opened up about his parents: \u201cMy mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example.\u201d And he opened up about his family: \u201cUnconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren.\u201d And he opened up about his faith, which he\u2019s infrequently discussed during his second bid for the White House. \u201cLike a lot of families in a new place with no family, we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community, it was welcoming and as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved to town or just joined our church,\u201d Romney shared. The race for the White House is basically a dead heat, but polls indicate Romney trails President Barack Obama when it comes to his favorable rating and likeability. And a speech in front of a national television audience of up to 40 million people gave Romney a perfect opportunity to open up. Miss Romney\u2019s speech? Here\u2019s a transcript So did Romney succeed in giving Americans a better sense of who he is? The jury\u2019s still out. \u201cSelf-revelation and introspection are still not his strong suits,\u201d said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, anchor of \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe had some good lines, some nods to his religion, but if you want a public emoter, Mitt Romney will never be your guy.\u201d CNN Chief Political Analyst David Gergen gave it mixed reviews. \u201cI think it humanized him very well. I think it introduced him on a personal level,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cI thought this speech had lots of heart, but it needed more soul. It needed more poetry.\u201d 2. Speech puts referendum election into sharp relief Romney\u2019s convention-night speech put into sharp focus how much Republicans think November\u2019s election will boil down to whether voters think they\u2019re better off economically under Obama. In the biggest speech of his political career, Romney spent much of his time picking apart his Democratic opponent, deriding the promises Obama made in 2008 and vowing to work harder to put Americans back into good paying jobs. \u201cPresident Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet,\u201d Romney said, harking back to statements Obama made when running for president four years ago. \u201cMy promise is to help you and your family,\u201d he continued as delegates roared. Photo gallery: The best pictures from the convention While attacks on Obama\u2019s economic polices are nothing new for Romney, his near-singular focus on trying to show the president\u2019s failings lent his convention speech the air of a fired-up campaign rally, rather than a sweeping address designed to rouse the base along with undecided voters. While other speakers over the course of the three-day convention offered feel-good moments, the heart of Romney\u2019s speech was an impassioned ticking through of the five-point economic plan he lays out at every campaign stop. Republicans, bolstered by polls showing voters putting the economy as their No. 1 issue, say that very specificity is what will put them over the top in November, even if it comes in place of the grander rhetoric employed by Obama. \u201cIt was that substance gap that he opened up against President Obama here where he made the case that what the president has done didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor and former press secretary for George W. Bush. \u201cI thought it was a big hit.\u201d The risk in Republicans\u2019 strategy is that it relies on economic factors out of their control. If the economy improves, the argument against Obama weakens. In a recognition of that reality, Romney\u2019s speech Thursday attempted to conjure a more general American funk, which the GOP nominee cast as a result of overhyped promises four years ago. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the kind of job he\u2019s done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him,\u201d Romney concluded. Fleischer said the line \u201cencapsulated the disappointment that the American people have in the country under President Obama. And that is a powerful indictment of a line.\u201d 3. Rubio seizes the moment If Romney loses in November, there will be a singular front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Not Paul Ryan. Not Chris Christie. Not Jeb Bush. His name is Marco Rubio. Republicans saw why on Thursday when the 41-year-old Cuban-American senator from Florida introduced Romney with a powerful speech about America\u2019s greatness that electrified the convention crowd. Rubio: Obama is a bad president In the GOP, Rubio is the only figure possessing the kind of goosebump-inducing stage presence that Barack Obama had 2008. Forget for a moment that his remarks were mostly absent of policy substance or lacked any specific argument as to why Romney will be a better president than Obama. Political campaigns are about stories, emotions and biography \u2013 and Rubio\u2019s speech had it all. There were doses of sharp-edged rhetoric to fire up the GOP crowd \u2013 \u201cOur problem is not that he\u2019s a bad person, our problem is that he\u2019s a bad president,\u201d went one of his best lines \u2013 but the speech was mostly optimistic and forward-looking. When he spoke about his personal life as the son of immigrants who \u201cnever made it big\u201d but worked hard nonetheless, the audience was rapt. Inside the convention hall, people were crying. One Republican operative in the audience texted CNN to say that the speech threatened to \u201covershadow\u201d Romney and said that the campaign should have given the keynote address on Tuesday night to Rubio instead of Chris Christie to avoid that very problem. The thing is, Rubio does this all the time. While on a much bigger stage and more finely tuned, the convention address was similar to any speech Rubio gave during his insurgent Senate bid in 2010. So even if he overshadowed Romney, he couldn\u2019t help it. Lanny Wiles, a longtime Republican master of campaign stagecraft, watched the Thursday speeches inside the CNN Grill in Tampa. He said the difference between Rubio and Romney is \u201clike the difference between a Baptist preacher and a Methodist minister.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same message, but one delivers it better,\u201d Wiles said. 4. The Bushes have a posse For half a decade now on the campaign trail, George W. Bush has been a punching bag not just for Obama and his fellow Democrats, but also for Republicans frustrated with his administration\u2019s tendency to break with conservative dogma on matters such as spending, education and immigration. Well, Jeb Bush is fed up and not going to take it anymore. You might have missed it if you weren\u2019t watching the speech at the height of prime time coverage, but the former Florida governor went off script to defend his brother, the deeply unpopular 43rd president of the United States. Open Story: CNN.com\u2019s collaborative convention coverage \u201cBefore I began my remarks, I have something personal I would like to share with you,\u201d Bush told the convention crowd. He said he was \u201cblessed to be part of a family that has committed its life to public service.\u201d \u201cAnd my brother, well, I love my brother,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a man of integrity, courage and honor, and during incredibly challenging times, he kept us say safe. So, Mr. President, it is time to stop blaming your predecessor for your failed economic policies.\u201d It was a comment that mostly flew under the radar. But it was a reminder of two things at a moment when GOP is still figuring out how to grapple with the Bush legacy. First, Bush family members will always defend their name and their honor in the face of political criticism. And second, Jeb is his own man. He has often strayed from the Romney script throughout this presidential campaign and was not afraid to do so again on Thursday, even if it risked reminding voters a president they might rather forget. 5. An unconventional lead-in to a convention speech Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood\u2019s unscripted endorsement of Mitt Romney lit up social media, with tweets that he was fantastic and edgy going up against tweets that he was awkward and terrible. But the larger question is whether the Academy Award-winning filmmaker and actor\u2019s performance distracted or stepped on the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s acceptance speech. Eastwood carried on a sometimes rambling conversation with an imaginary President Barack Obama in an empty chair next to the podium. Eastwood\u2019s speech: Good, bad or ugly? \u201cSo, Mr. President, how do you handle promises that you have made when you were running for election, and how do you handle them?\u201d Eastwood asked. \u201cI mean, what do you say to people? Do you just \u2013 you know \u2013 I know \u2013 people were wondering \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 handle that OK. Well, I know even people in your own party were very disappointed when you didn\u2019t close Gitmo. And I thought, well closing Gitmo \u2013 why close that, we spent so much money on it. But, I thought maybe as an excuse \u2013 what do you mean shut up?\u201d Eastwood continued. Moments later, Eastwood asked the imaginary Obama, \u201cWhat do you want me to tell Romney?\u201d and answered his own question by saying, \u201cI can\u2019t tell him to do that. I can\u2019t tell him to do that to himself.\u201d Minutes after Eastwood left the podium, a Romney campaign official put out a statement justifying the performance, saying, \u201cJudging an American icon like Clint Eastwood through a typical political lens doesn\u2019t work. His ad-libbing was a break from all the political speeches, and the crowd enjoyed it. He rightly pointed out that 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed is a national disgrace and it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d Some conservative pundits agreed. GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said Eastwood \u201cproved he cannot do improv. But he did something that is rare in politics. He made it socially acceptable to be able to laugh at Barack Obama.\u201d And some suggested that the optics would have been much better, and Romney would have been better served, if Eastwood had been given a slot in the less important 9 p.m. hour than at 10 p.m., when the broadcast networks started their coverage. Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville, in a rare moment of diplomacy, said Eastwood\u2019s performance \u201cwas different.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Paul Ryan tells the GOP convention that solutions are needed now, and \"we can do this\" NEW: Sen. McCain, Condoleezza Rice call for strength through power Ryan, the VP nominee, builds on the convention theme of \"We Can Change It\" The convention seeks to depict Mitt Romney as the protector of the American dream In the biggest speech of his still young political career, GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan told the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that time is running out to solve the nation\u2019s fiscal problems, but Mitt Romney and he can do it if elected in November. \u201cWe will not duck the tough issues \u2013 we will lead,\u201d Ryan said in his prime time address televised nationwide. \u201c\u2026 The work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of us \u2013 all of us, but we can do this. Together, we can do this.\u201d Ryan\u2019s speech was part of a campaign effort to portray Romney, a multimillionaire businessman and former Massachusetts governor, as a champion of working-class Americans who struggle under the policies of President Barack Obama. Romney chose Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, as his running mate in hopes that the fiscal expert known for big and hard-line ideas would galvanize support on the political right and appeal to moderates and independents seeking solutions for the nation\u2019s chronic deficit and debt problems. Ryan\u2019s speech delivered a fiery attack on Obama\u2019s record and highlighted the GOP allegiance to founding principles as he decried a dearth of leadership and pledged results in keeping with the convention theme for the day: \u201cWe Can Change It.\u201d \u201cI accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old \u2013 and I know that we are ready,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cOur nominee is sure ready. His whole life has prepared him for this moment \u2013 to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words. After four years of getting the runaround, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Gov. Mitt Romney.\u201d Ryan focused mostly on the fiscal issues that are the congressman\u2019s strength, such as the national debt, stimulus spending under Obama and his proposed Medicare reforms, which have come under attack by Obama and Democrats. He sought to turn the tables on the issue, repeating the factually challenged assertion that Obama cut Medicare by more than $700 billion to cover the costs of the 2010 health care reform law passed by Democrats. The figure comes from a July 24 Congressional Budget Office report  that said repealing the health care law, as called for by Romney and Ryan, would increase spending on Medicare by $716 billion through 2022. At the same time, the CBO letter said keeping Obamacare in place would not mean a $716 billion decrease in Medicare spending, as claimed by Ryan. \u201cThe president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare.\u201d If elected, he and Romney will confront the tough issues \u201cbefore the math and the momentum overwhelm us all,\u201d Ryan added. Five things we learned at the RNC His speech included some humorous jabs at Obama that drew laughs and ovations from a charged convention crowd. \u201cWith all their attack ads, the president is just throwing away money \u2013 and he\u2019s pretty experienced at that,\u201d Ryan said early in the speech. Later, he received a standing ovation when he asked: \u201cWithout a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?\u201d Ryan also peppered his remarks with references to central government planning and control, code words for socialism among the most conservative elements of the Republican Party. \u201cNone of us should have to settle for the best this administration offers \u2013 a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us,\u201d he said. In the most emotional moment, Ryan paid tribute to his mother, who started her own business after his father died. Santorum: Obama's dream 'a nightmare' GOP stars throw support behind Romney Ann Romney addresses the RNC Unconventional: Postcards from Tampa \u201cIt was a new life, and it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman whose happiness wasn\u2019t just in the past,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHer work gave her hope.  It made our family proud.  And to this day, my mom is my role model.\u201d In the VIP box of the Tampa Bay Times Forum, Ryan\u2019s mother, Betty, stood and waved, and he touched his heart with his hand while gazing at her. In other speeches Wednesday night, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona offered biting criticism of Obama\u2019s presidency, saying the president was failing to adhere to American values. Paul took aim at domestic policies that he blamed for the country\u2019s debt now equaling its economic production, calling Obama \u201cuniquely unqualified to lead this great nation.\u201d \u201cThe republic of Washington and Jefferson is now in danger of becoming the nation of debt and despair,\u201d said Paul, the son of vanquished Republican candidate Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. McCain, the Republican presidential candidate defeated by Obama four years ago, took aim at what he called diminishing American power and influence around the world. He accused Obama of abandoning freedom movements in Iran and Syria by not supporting protesters trying to overthrow oppressive regimes, saying \u201cour president is not being true to our values.\u201d \u201cWe can choose to follow a declining path, toward a future that is dimmer and more dangerous than our past, or we can choose to reform our failing government, revitalize our ailing economy, and renew the foundations of our power and leadership in the world,\u201d said McCain, a consistent advocate for a stronger military. \u201cThat is what\u2019s at stake in this election.\u201d Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice added her voice to the call for American strength through power, delivering a politically charged speech that accused Obama of yielding the nation\u2019s leadership role in the world. \u201cIt just has to be that the freest and most compassionate country on the face of the Earth will continue to be the most powerful,\u201d Rice said to cheers. Romney and Republicans contend that Obama\u2019s policies, such as stimulus spending, have worsened an already bad economic situation the president inherited from the previous GOP administration. They propose traditional conservative policies to shrink government, cut taxes and drastically reform entitlements, which they say will bring economic growth and job creation. Obama and Democrats say such prescriptions are failed policies of the past, and call for increased revenue sources such as higher taxes for wealthy Americans to be part of a deficit reduction plan that includes some spending cuts and entitlement reforms. \u201cOn almost every issue he wants to go backwards, sometimes all the way to the last century,\u201d Obama said Wednesday at a campaign event in Virginia. For Ryan, 42, the vice presidential nomination and convention speech mean an elevated national profile after never having a statewide race. The convention is proceeding as Hurricane Isaac drenches the Gulf Coast after making landfall in Louisiana on Tuesday night, the eve of the seven-year anniversary of devastating Hurricane Katrina. Isaac prompted Republican organizers to postpone the first day of the convention, which is crucial for defining Romney to the American people. Romney mentioned Isaac at a campaign event on Wednesday in Indiana, joking that he appreciated the chance to be there \u201con dry land.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts are, of course, with the people of the Gulf Coast states,\u201d he said, noting the Katrina anniversary. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that it appears that Isaac will spare them from the kind of damage we saw during Katrina, but for many in the Gulf Coast who just finished repairing their homes and getting their lives back to normal, this must be a heavy burden. And so today our thoughts are with them, our prayers go out to them and our country must do all we can to help them recover.\u201d GOP officials pushed ahead with a convention agenda designed to frame the election as a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency while attempting to turn Romney\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities into campaign advantages. GOP convention: Live blog Romney clinched the Republican nomination in the roll call of state delegates Tuesday after a rugged Republican primary campaign that saw momentum swings nearly every week and bitter attacks by GOP colleagues The  2,200-plus convention delegates also approved a conservative platform that calls for less government, opposes same-sex marriage and endorses a \u201chuman life amendment\u201d to ban abortion, with no specific exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is threatened. Romney and Ryan, who also was endorsed by delegates Tuesday, will be formally nominated on Thursday, and Romney\u2019s acceptance speech that night will conclude the convention with the highest-profile political moment in the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s career. The convention seeks to portray Obama as a failed leader whose policies undermine the American dream, directly attacking the president on the issue of equal opportunity that traditionally favors Democrats. Speaker after speaker has emphasized his or her own humble beginnings as descendants of immigrants who worked hard to achieve success for their families and never expected government help or handouts. Virtually every speaker took umbrage with Obama\u2019s comment on the campaign trail that \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d in reference to successful businesses that received government help along the way. On Tuesday night, Romney\u2019s wife Ann faced a similar entry as Ryan into the full-bore glare of presidential media coverage with her own prime time speech that delivered a political broadside with a personal touch. She mixed homespun anecdotes, such as repeated references to their first date, with references to issues considered weaknesses for her husband \u2013 support from women and his personal wealth \u2013 in encouraging Americans to get to know  the warm and loving man she met at a high school dance. \u201cThis was a political speech wrapped in velvet,\u201d CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger commented. Ann Romney took on another tricky political issue for her husband Wednesday when she addressed a Latino coalition and challenged the traditional support by Hispanic-Americans for Democrats, including Obama. \u201cI feel like my importance in speaking out is making sure that those coalitions that would naturally be voting for another party wake up and say you better really look at the issues this time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou better really look at your future and say who is going to be the guy who is going to make it better for you and your children. And there is only one answer.\u201d Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called Wednesday for a more comprehensive and moderate immigration policy by Republicans in order to make inroads with the Latino community. \u201cThe Republican Party has to become the pro-legal immigration party, not simply the anti-illegal immigration party, and that begins by recognizing that a million people a year immigrate to the United States legally, permanently. No other country even comes close,\u201d said Rubio, a Hispanic-American conservative who is a rising Republican star. Noting that millions of illegal immigrants present what he called a humanitarian problem, he added: \u201cWe are not going to give amnesty to 12 million people, we are not going to round up and deport 12 million people. Somewhere between those two ideas there is a solution.\u201d The GOP platform contains traditional conservative planks on immigration and other issues, including support for the \u201chuman life amendment\u201d with no exceptions to an abortion ban. That runs counter to overall public opinion in America, especially among women. Obama took aim at conservative GOP social policies Wednesday, saying voters can decide the direction of the country. \u201cIn November you can say in this century women can be trusted to make their own health care choices,\u201d the president said to cheers. \u201cYou can say that in this century we don\u2019t think young immigrants who were brought here when they were children and understand themselves as Americans and have pledged allegiance to the flag should suddenly be deported to countries where they have never been.\u201d The Obama campaign also has made an issue of Romney\u2019s personal wealth, challenging him to release more than the two years of tax returns he has made public \u2013 as his father did in releasing 12 years of returns when running for president in 1968 \u2013 and questioning whether his career as a venture capitalist benefited workers or prepared him to deal with a sluggish economy. Democrats ask: What did Romney build? In her speech Tuesday night, Ann Romney addressed the Democratic attacks head-on, noting her husband\u2019s success throughout his career and expressing amazement that such a record was being criticized. \u201cIf the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt\u2019s success?\u201d she said. RNC images from CNN staff For Romney, 65, the nomination puts him within one step of the goal he first sought in 2007 by running for president after serving as a Republican governor for four years in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts. Though rivals challenged his conservative credentials in the 2012 primaries, Romney emerged victorious. But he continues to walk a political tightrope in trying to energize right-wing support while also appealing to moderates and independent voters. The latest CNN/ORC International Poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, with new numbers released Sunday showing that 53% of likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs, compared with 39% for Romney. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney leads 48% to 44% over Obama on managing the government effectively and has a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation\u2019s problems. Both figures are within the survey\u2019s margin of error.

            "article_content": "Tune in to CNN\u2019s documentary \u201cRomney Revealed: Family, Faith and the Road to Power,\u201d with Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, debuting Sunday night at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. NEW: A new poll gives Obama the advantage on social issues, Romney on economic issues A  source says organizers are not ruling out extending the convention by a day The shortened convention seeks to define Mitt Romney as a candidate and leader The storm and Rep. Akin's incendiary comments undermine the pre-convention focus A shortened Republican National Convention needs to overcome a threatening hurricane, as well as Democratic attacks and lingering internal rifts, to seize the best remaining chance to show America the real Mitt Romney before the November election, top Republicans said Sunday. GOP officials already canceled Monday\u2019s planned first day of the convention because of Isaac, the tropical storm growing to hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida. The now three-day convention starting Tuesday will still feature all of the major scheduled speeches, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told CNN Sunday. That will be plenty of time to nominate the former Massachusetts governor, \u201ctell the Mitt Romney story\u201d and show why he is the right person to fix problems left unresolved by what Republicans called the failed policies of President Barack Obama, Priebus added. Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008 who had the first day of his nominating convention in Minneapolis, shortened because of a hurricane then threatening the Gulf Coast, agreed that losing one night is manageable. The long road to Tampa Obama, Romney locked in a tight race Remaking the Republican Party The countdown to the GOP convention However, McCain told NBC on Sunday that \u201cit could be harmful if we lose more than that.\u201d In a sign of how badly the party wants to hold the convention to showcase Romney, GOP officials have not ruled out extending it by a day to Friday if necessary, a Republican source told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring the situation, and we\u2019ll respond accordingly,\u201d convention press secretary Kyle Downey said when asked about a possible extension Romney and his wife attended church on Sunday. The opening hymn, with its chorus of \u201conward, ever onward,\u201d reinforced the imagery of a tough struggle. Romney on faith, family and private life A new national survey illustrates the challenge Romney faces. While the CNN/ORC International indicates a dead heat between Romney and President Barack Obama, new numbers released Sunday show that likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs. \u201cThe public gives Obama a big advantage over Romney on questions on caring about people and understanding their concerns,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, adding that Romney\u2019s strong points \u2013 in the minds of poll respondents \u2013 were his managerial skills and having a clear plan to solve the country\u2019s problems. According to the poll, 53% of likely voters say Obama cares about the needs of people, with 39% feeling the same way about the former Massachusetts governor. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney has a 48%-44% margin over Obama on managing the government effectively and a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation\u2019s problems. Both are within the survey\u2019s margin of error. \u201cThe challenge facing Romney at the GOP convention is to build on those managerial strengths while at the same trying to convince average Americans that he is in touch with their problems. Obama\u2019s personal characteristics, for the moment, outshine Romney\u2019s,\u201d Holland said. On specific issues, the poll results show a similar dynamic \u2013 Obama is generally ahead on foreign policy and social issues while Romney is generally preferred on economic issues. According to the survey, likely voters prefer Obama\u2019s policies on gay and lesbian issues by 59%-33% and choose Obama over Romney on abortion by 53%-40%. The president also has a 51%-44% advantage over Romney on foreign policy and a 50%-43% margin on terrorism. The candidates were statistically even on the economy, with Romney\u2019s 50%-46% advantage within the survey\u2019s margin of error, and Romney holds a 10-point advantage on handling the federal deficit. Priebus said Sunday that delaying the start of the convention was \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d adding that that most of Monday\u2019s planned events would be folded into the remainder of the week\u2019s schedule. \u201cEverything is going to be back to normal on Tuesday,\u201d Priebus said, adding that some speeches might be shorter than originally planned. The RNC chairman will open the convention on Monday, then quickly declare it in recess until the full proceedings begin on Tuesday afternoon, with Romney\u2019s formal nomination expected a few hours later, organizers said. Romney will close the convention with his acceptance speech on Thursday night, which was the original plan. Romney stirs \u2018birther\u2019 controversy; Akin to stay in Senate race On Sunday talk shows, Republicans said the convention must focus on Romney\u2019s character and show how he can lead the nation to economic prosperity, which is the top issue with voters. \u201cIt\u2019s the vision of Mitt Romney versus the record of Barack Obama, and facts just are stubborn things,\u201d Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell told ABC, adding that \u201cthe middle class is hurting\u201d and people want \u201cresults, not rhetoric.\u201d The Obama campaign, anticipating the Romney branding effort by Republicans, released a movie trailer-style video Sunday that previewed a \u201cdo-over\u201d moment for Romney. In a statement accompanying the video, the Obama campaign said it is \u201cpresenting Americans with an epic cinematic preview of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u2018convention reinvention\u2019 \u2013 the Do-Over moment that voters have grown to expect \u2013 because they\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d Responding to the video, Romney\u2019s campaign said Sunday the president was relying on \u201cnegative attacks\u201d as a way to distract from his own record. However, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told ABC that Romney is vulnerable to being portrayed as a political opportunist because of the right-wing positions he adopted during the rugged primary campaign against conservatives such as Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. \u201cI suspect that they are not going to be able to Etch-a-Sketch their way out of this campaign,\u201d Villaraigosa, a Democrat, told CNN with a reference to a Romney aides comment earlier this year about resetting the campaign message. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to put away all the things they said in the primary and all the things they have in their platform right now.\u201d Last week, incendiary comments by conservative Republican Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri ignited a political firestorm about rape and abortion as the Romney team sought to build momentum up to the convention. Akin, who won Missouri\u2019s Republican Senate primary to challenge Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November, told an interviewer that women have an undefined biological response to what he called \u201clegitimate rape\u201d that oftentimes prevents pregnancy. Romney and a full spectrum of GOP politicians \u2013 from the Republican National Committee to tea party groups \u2013 condemned Akin\u2019s comments and called for him to drop out of a race considered crucial to Republican hopes of winning a Senate majority. Akin apologized and called his remarks incorrect, but he has refused to end his Senate bid. The imbroglio has given new life to McCaskill, considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator running, and caused chagrin within the Republican establishment. \u201cI think that he should get out of the race,\u201d Priebus said of Akin. \u201cHe has time to get out of the race and he ought to put the mission of liberty and freedom ahead of himself.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, told CBS that Akin\u2019s statements \u201cmake it much more difficult \u2013 borderline impossible, perhaps \u2013 for him to win that race.\u201d A further concern is that Akin\u2019s comments focused attention on the volatile abortion issue in the run-up to the convention, when the Romney campaign wanted to talk about the candidate\u2019s prescriptions for high unemployment and slow economic growth under Obama. Instead, Romney and running mate Paul Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, have been asked repeatedly about differences between their personal views on whether abortion should be banned in all cases or permitted only for pregnancies from rape, incest or that threaten the life of the mother. Romney throws campaign another curve ball with \u2018birther\u2019 remark Romney\u2019s Mormon faith supports the narrow exceptions, while Ryan \u2013 a devout Catholic \u2013 supports a blanket ban. The campaign has made clear the ticket supports Romney\u2019s stance, which also contrasts with the party platform that convention delegates are scheduled to vote on this week. In an interview with Fox broadcast on Sunday, Romney again answered questions on the Akin comments, saying \u201cit obviously is being used by Democrats to try and cast a shadow on our entire party, and it\u2019s not.\u201d At the same time, Romney noted that Democrats were \u201cwise enough to understand\u201d that Akin\u2019s comments can hurt Republicans. In addition, polls show Obama continuing to hold a big lead over Romney among Hispanic-Americans, the fastest-growing demographic group in the country. Conservative opposition to immigration reforms \u2013 such as the policy put in place by the Obama administration to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants who came to America as children \u2013 prevents GOP gains with Hispanic-American voters, some Republicans say. \u201cOur demographics are changing, and we have to change not necessarily our core beliefs but the tone of our message and the message and the intensity of it for sure,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told NBC on Sunday. \u201cLong-term conservative principles, if they\u2019re to be successful and implemented, there has to be a concerted effort to reach out to a much broader audience than we do today.\u201d Bush noted that some Republicans benefit in their conservative districts by using immigration as a \u201cwedge issue\u201d to build right-wing opposition to Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask people to join your cause and then send a signal that you\u2019re really not wanted. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Romney says he\u2019s \u2018very proud\u2019 of Massachusetts health care law Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, told CNN that Romney was still in \u201cthe early stages\u201d of getting to be known by the Hispanic-American community. \u201cCan we get this done in 75 days? I think enough to win this election, and then it\u2019s a long-term project to do a lot better institutionally as a party,\u201d Cardenas said. The CNN/ORC International poll shows more likely voters preferring Romney over Obama on handling illegal immigration. Meanwhile, a new Romney ad Sunday continued his campaign\u2019s aggressive stance on another potentially vulnerable issue \u2013 Medicare. Like previous Romney spots, the new ad includes a claim that, \u201cAs president, Barack Obama cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare,\u201d the 2010 health care reform law despised by Republicans. The claim cites a report from the Congressional Budget Office that shows repeal of the president\u2019s health care law would mean an additional $716 billion in spending on Medicare. However, it ignored the same report\u2019s finding that the additional spending would come from rising costs and inefficiencies that the health care law would have addressed, rather than restoring money cut from Medicare. The Obama campaign has called the Romney claim on Medicare false, citing the CBO report, and repeatedly attacked the Medicare reform plan proposed by Ryan that would partially privatize the government-run health care program for senior citizens. Democrats claim the Republican proposal would \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d while Ryan says his plan is the kind of reform necessary to ensure Medicare\u2019s long-term solvency. According to the poll results released Sunday, likely voters are evenly divided between the candidates on the Medicare issue.

            "article_content": "Rhode Island delegate urged her party to recognize civil unions for same-sex couples Her motion failed, but the delegate says GOP is more supportive behind the scenes Gay groups at the convention in Tampa say they are still optimistic about their future \"People are always welcoming to us when we are here,\" head of Log Cabin Republicans says Barbara Ann Fenton made what was for some a shocking suggestion at one of the most traditionally conservative meetings leading up to the Republican National Convention. The 31-year-old delegate from Rhode Island formally suggested that her party\u2019s ideological manifesto recognize civil unions for same-sex couples as well as straight ones. \u201cAs a Roman Catholic, there\u2019s nobody in this room who believes (more than I do) that the definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, but those are my religious beliefs,\u201d Fenton said as she made the motion Monday. \u201cThis country was founded on the separation of church and state.\u201d She added, \u201cFor my own generation, a lot of times homosexuality is not the biggest deal in the world. And that\u2019s OK.\u201d Many other controversial amendments were met with \u201ccrickets,\u201d as one Republican staffer said. Meaning, on those topics, there wasn\u2019t even a move to vote on the matter. Gold: Gay marriage a GOP 'wedge issue' Santorum booed on same-sex marriage Teen vs. Bachmann on same-sex marriage Can \u2018true Catholics\u2019 support same-sex marriage? Fenton\u2019s initiative, much to her own surprise, was met with a resounding shout of \u201csecond\u201d from not one, but from a couple of people in the room. Themis Klarides, a state representative from Connecticut, was one of the delegates who affirmed Fenton\u2019s motion. \u201cI\u2019m from New England, where support for gay couples is really old news,\u201d Klarides said. In 2005, her state became the first to create a law that allowed civil unions for same-sex couples without judicial interference. She voted in favor of the law on several occasions until it got through. \u201cThis speaks to the heart of what Republicans believe in \u2013 less government interference in our lives,\u201d Klarides said. \u201cWe want our party to focus on growth and the economy and allowing us to thrive as a people, not on telling people what they should do in our private lives.\u201d Klarides\u2019 fellow Republicans on the platform committee did not agree. She describes what it felt like to listen to the ensuing debate. \u201cI called my mom afterward and said this woman put this amendment out there, and I seconded it, and you would have thought I took off all my clothes and stood in the middle of the aisle,\u201d Klarides said. Fenton also called her mom after the meeting. Her mother had read about her daughter\u2019s amendment suggestion online. \u201cMy mom said, \u2018You are creating mischief again. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u2019 \u201d Fenton said. Others on the platform committee didn\u2019t share that sentiment. In his argument against the amendment, Indiana delegate Jim Bopp characterized civil unions as \u201ccounterfeit marriage.\u201d Bopp, an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pointed to the popularity of constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage and argued that the party benefits politically from its opposition to it. \u201cThis suggests that strongly supporting traditional marriage is actually quite popular and would enhance the support of our candidates,\u201d Bopp said. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, made a strong argument against Fenton\u2019s motion, calling \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d a cornerstone of a healthy society. \u201cThis would move the party away immensely (from) the position this party has held,\u201d Perkins said. The motion failed resoundingly. Republican mayor\u2019s pro-same-sex marriage ad to air during convention The platform committee went on to include several other anti-gay issues in its proposed draft.  An editorial in The New York Times called it \u201cmore aggressive in its opposition to women\u2019s reproductive rights and to gay rights than any in memory.\u201d The draft affirmed the support of state constitutional amendment efforts under way to restrict same-sex marriage. It criticized the Obama administration\u2019s \u201copen defiance\u201d of existing laws that should put a limit on gay people\u2019s rights and \u201cits handling of immigration cases, in federal personnel benefits, in allowing a same-sex marriage at a military base, and in refusing to defend DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act) in the courts.\u201d And it reiterated the party\u2019s support for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2013 sitting in that room, I felt like people thought what I was proposing meant I was campaigning for President Obama,\u201d Fenton said.  \u201cBack home where everyone is so much more liberal, people think I\u2019m so right wing. Geography is everything.\u201d Fenton said after the meeting she had only one disturbing run-in. \u201cOne person did come up and tell me I should renounce my Catholicism \u2013 that what I was spewing was pure evil,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cIt was hard to keep a straight face.\u201d But for the most part, the reaction she received from other delegates and Republican staffers was positive. She said she felt that behind the scenes, the party was much more supportive. \u201cPeople kept buying me drinks and kept coming up to me saying how they wanted to support my group for doing this. I don\u2019t have a group,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cSome people asked me if I was gay. I told them you could still be for gay rights and be a heterosexual. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s political suicide. If it was, I wouldn\u2019t be a part of this party.\u201d She said, \u201cOne guy even dropped a note in my lap. I thought I was going to get bashed with some nasty note, like you\u2019d get in fifth grade. But what it said essentially was, \u2018I\u2019m in the closet. Thank you so much for this.\u2019 \u201cPeople may now realize you can be gay and still be welcome in the GOP party.\u201d While the Republican Party may take anti-gay positions on paper, behind the scenes many who advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes feel more accepted.  There is even an ad that will run during the convention that will feature San Diego\u2019s Republican mayor, Jerry Sanders, speaking out in favor of allowing same-sex marriage. Sanders urges his party to do the same. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups within the convention at Tampa say they are still optimistic about their future. \u201cThe platform is a piece of paper,\u201d said Jimmy LaSalvia, executive director of GOProud Inc., which will attend the convention and hold \u201cHomocon 2012,\u201d a giant dance party with Republican notables after the speeches Tuesday. GOProud is the first gay Republican group to endorse Romney for president. \u201cThe platform doesn\u2019t carry rights and responsibilities that the candidate is bound by,\u201d he said. \u201cRoutinely after the platform is out, candidates quickly make statements that they don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d LaSalvia is not discouraged \u2013 in fact he said he\u2019s excited about how much they can do to support the ticket. \u201cThis election is bigger than one issue. We are in a crisis in this country and gay people need jobs. Sure same-sex marriage is important, but we can\u2019t base our presidential vote on it,\u201d LaSalvia said. R. Clarke Cooper, who runs the Log Cabin Republicans, a national Republican gay and lesbian grassroots organization, said he\u2019s optimistic about the party\u2019s future as well despite the platform. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, sure,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut all the polling data shows that the party is growing and strengthening because of this younger generation of Republican who believes in the true definition of conservatism, which is individual liberty and not having the government involved in your personal life.\u201d Cooper said leading up to the platform committee meeting, his group was invited for the first time to be directly involved in drafting the platform. Log Cabin hasn\u2019t endorsed Romney yet, but members will decide that issue soon. In the meantime, Cooper points to small aspects of the platform that he thinks will benefit the LGBT community. \u201cThe original draft said one could not receive refugee status for nonpolitical reasons, which would mean that there are LGBT people running for their lives who aren\u2019t political dissidents but who couldn\u2019t come here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey struck that from the language. That was a win.\u201d He also said in the marriage section, the platform committee added a caveat that \u201ceveryone deserves dignity and respect.\u201d And he celebrates even the small victories. His group\u2019s educational material was on a table \u201cnext to the stacks of Family Research Council material,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they were reeling, but if they asked leadership why it was there, they would hear it is because the RNC asked that all materials be put out there for delegates and press to pick up. \u201cIt is a small thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut our presence was known here. We were invited to be much more engaged in the process than we ever have been before.\u201d The Log Cabin Republicans have several events planned for the convention, including brunches with other gay conservatives, and candidate meet-and-greets. The Log Cabin PAC is also hosting a party to celebrate its congressional allies. \u201cI always wear my Log Cabin pin, and people are always welcoming to us when we are here,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely evident that there is an even bigger thing happening with the party. All the polling data shows that there is a generational shift that makes our party more accepting, even if it did not manifest itself in the platform.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama's campaign continues its online dominance, a new study finds The Obama campaign and its supporters were more active online, the study says GOP challenger Mitt Romney is closing the gap, Pew says Barack Obama\u2019s campaign is making better use of the Internet and social media to reach voters than presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney, according to a study released Wednesday. The Pew Research Center\u2019s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that Obama\u2019s campaign was more active than Romney\u2019s and generated more response from users on all major platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and the campaign websites, in the weeks following Romney\u2019s clinching of the Republican nomination. For instance, during the June 4-17 study period, Obama\u2019s campaign posted an average of 29 messages per day compared to Romney\u2019s average of one, according to Pew. The Obama campaign website and blog were updated an average of eight times a day, twice as often as Romney\u2019s, Pew found. Obama\u2019s social media messages also reached a much wider audience, according to Pew. Obama hangs out at Google Ryan pick adds social media muscle On Facebook, users expressed support for nearly twice as many Obama posts as they did Romney posts. Twitter users passed along, or retweeted, 150,106 Obama messages to their own followers, compared to 8,601 retweets of Romney posts, according to the study. Pew said Obama had more than 18 million followers on Twitter when it last audited the account, in August, compared to 787,080 for Romney. Obama\u2019s Facebook page had 27.5 million supporters, compared to 2.9 million for Romney. The results echo the 2008 campaign, when Obama\u2019s campaign had more than five times the supporters on Facebook as then Republican rival John McCain two months before the election, according to Pew. At the time, analysts credited Obama\u2019s technologically savvy campaign with helping reach and organize voters, especially among younger supporters. \u201cWhile more digital activity does not necessarily translate into more votes, historically candidates who are first to exploit changing technology have an advantage,\u201d project director Tom Rosenstiel said in a statement. \u201cFrom Roosevelt to Reagan, presidential candidates have used the way they communicate to suggest that they understand how the country is changing.\u201d The study follows news from June showing that Obama was also leading Romney in the use of online advertising. Obama spent $16.4 million in online advertising in the first few months of 2012, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Romney had spent $7.8 million, according to the filings. The Pew study released Wednesday focused on the campaigns\u2019 use of social media in early June, shortly after Romney had won enough delegates in state primaries to clinch the GOP presidential nomination. According to the Pew study: Romney\u2019s campaign has closed the gap in some respects since the June study period, the center\u2019s Deputy Director Amy Mitchell said in a statement. \u201cBut there is a long way to go before the Romney team matches the level of activity of the Obama campaign,\u201d Mitchell said.",

            "article_content": "Programming note: Watch CNN correspondent Poppy Harlow\u2019s Rust Belt road trip on CNN Newsroom this week at 10 a.m. ET. Autoworkers in key Rust Belt states disagree over industry bailout CNN talks to workers during road trip across Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio President Barack Obama is \"putting us further into debt,\" one worker says Another worker says he fears Mitt Romney won't be able to create high-paying jobs Steve Bengelsvorf and Terry Flynn are chatting over beers on a hot, humid Wednesday night at Bamboozles, a Dearborn, Michigan, bar and restaurant, and a common pit stop for nearby factory workers. Both these clean-cut men sitting at the bar in polo-style shirts have a lot in common. They work at the nearby Severstal steel company. They\u2019re nearing retirement. And they both have strong opinions about who the next president should be. But their politics are as different as their taste in beer. \u201cI\u2019m not for Obamacare, I\u2019m not for his immigration policies, I don\u2019t particularly agree with 100% of his economic policies,\u201d Bengelsvorf said. For the record, he\u2019s a Bud Light guy \u2013 and a Mitt Romney supporter. \u201cWe can\u2019t go further into debt, and Obama is putting us further and further into debt by all these stimulus plans.\u201d Flynn, a Miller Lite guy, supports President Barack Obama. If it weren\u2019t for the Obama-backed health care law, Flynn said his friend\u2019s unemployed son (a recent college graduate) wouldn\u2019t have health insurance coverage. CNN Poll: Health care ruling has not impacted race for White House, so far When it comes to the economy, Flynn admits it\u2019s taking too long to recover from the recession. But he said that \u201cgoing back to the policies that got us into this mess is not the direction we want to go.\u201d Severstal supplies steel to the big three automakers \u2013 Ford, General Motors and Chrysler \u2013 so Flynn\u2019s and Bengelsvorf\u2019s jobs are tied to the auto industry. Both agree on one thing: The $80 billion federal bailout of the auto industry was good for their jobs. Still, Bengelsvorf looks at it through broader lens. At one point he said, \u201cThe other side of me says you don\u2019t bail out a company that\u2019s going bankrupt.\u201d These two friends epitomize what we found when hitting the road in the Rust Belt. CNN took the pulse of voters in auto towns in Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio \u2013 important states that could make or break Election Day for Obama and Romney. In 2008, Obama captured all four states. But this year Indiana is leaning toward Romney \u2013 and Ohio is a tossup. Battle for the 'rust belt' states 'Little Detroit' split on next president Motor City stalled over Obama, Romney In the 12 elections between 1964 and 2008 no presidential candidate has won without winning Ohio. This year Ohio has about 30,000 fewer auto manufacturing jobs than it did in 2007. Michigan has 50,000 fewer automaking jobs. On the bright side, Michigan and Ohio, respectively, have seen the nation\u2019s biggest percentage declines in unemployment over the past two years. Make no mistake, these four states hold keys to the White House because all together they have 55 of 270 electoral votes needed to win. As Obama makes a second journey down the campaign trail, he\u2019s touting the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler \u2013 and you can bet he\u2019ll continue to do so. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed, managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. Watch: Politics in a former GM town During a stop at the Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery in Kokomo, Indiana, a lot of folks with auto industry ties wanted to talk politics, including Cliff Pitcher and his friend DeWayne Bates. Just like in Michigan \u2013 these two auto-industry friends are not supporting the same candidate. Bates doesn\u2019t think the president deserves another four years. Pitcher does. \u201cMitt Romney, I like his economical experience and his business experience, and I think that would help get our country job growth and help us get back on our feet,\u201d said Bates, a retired Chrysler millwright. Pitcher, an electrician at one of four Kokomo Chrysler plants, counters, \u201cRomney might be able to create jobs, but they\u2019re gonna pay $7 or $8 an hour and you know \u2026 I can\u2019t support my family on $7 or $8 with no benefits. Numbers don\u2019t mean anything in the creation of jobs if they\u2019re not quality jobs.\u201d I can\u2019t support my family on $7 or $8 with no benefits. Cliff Pitcher, Chrysler autoworker As a member of the autoworkers\u2019 union that traditionally skews Democratic, Bates said he feels like his support for Romney puts him in the minority. But other union autoworkers spoke out who take issue with Obama\u2019s economic policies \u2013 particularly the auto bailout \u2013 and are throwing their support behind Romney. Among them are Brian Pannebecker, who has worked at a Ford factory in Sterling Heights, Michigan, for 16 years. In Pannebecker\u2019s view, Obama shouldn\u2019t have bailed out the industry. His company, Ford, did not take a bailout. \u201cWhat I object to is all of the taxpayer dollars that were used,\u201d Pannebecker said. \u201cI think markets need to be allowed to work. And there were some fundamental problems that GM and Chrysler had that really were of their own making.\u201d Just a few miles away from Pannebecker, electrician Stacy Steward stood in blistering 95-degree heat across the street from the Chrysler plant where she had just finished a long day\u2019s work. After being laid off from Chrysler in 2008 and out of work for 17 months, she said she was rehired one month after the auto bailout. I think markets need to be allowed to work. Brian Pannebecker, Ford autoworker CNN Poll: Economic optimism jumping \u201cThe Big Three support the entire state of Michigan,\u201d Steward said. \u201cThe auto loans didn\u2019t just help Chrysler and GM; the auto loan also helped all of our suppliers. It helped all the small businesses in the areas. It helped the citizens.\u201d Throughout this road trip in every town we visited \u2013 large or small \u2013 autoworkers expressed countless combinations of opinions about the state of the economy and the political direction of the nation. Come November, after all the stump speeches across the Rust Belt are said and done, many of these folks will cast their votes, hoping their candidate will take the nation\u2019s highest office. Some will get their way \u2013 and others won\u2019t.  No doubt it will be fascinating to watch.

            "article_content": "Thursday's health care ruling angers the political right Recent poll says public thinks justices base rulings on personal views, rather than the law Analyst: The Supreme Court gets dragged down by party politics in Washington Bush v. Gore case increased the perception of a politicized high court, analyst says Most Americans think Supreme Court justices base their rulings on personal political views rather than legal interpretation, polls show, and Thursday\u2019s ruling on the politically charged health care reform law will probably reinforce that. By the narrowest of margins, the high court upheld almost all of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement: the 2010 Affordable Care Act despised by conservatives as an expansion of government. The 5-4 decision prompted immediate criticism from the political right and the dissenting justices that it was an improper judicial overreach. Meanwhile, the reaction on the left was jubilant, with the Democratic National Committee executive director tweeting in exuberance: \u201cit\u2019s constitutional. Bitches.\u201d Republicans have new rallying point With justices clearly identified as conservative or liberal, based on their rulings and the party affiliation of the presidents who nominated them, any decision on a high-profile, emotional issue such as health care reform seemed certain to exacerbate the perception of politics motivating the ruling. A recent CBS News/New York Times poll found that 55% of respondents believed Supreme Court justices would decide the health care cases based on personal or political views, compared with 32% who said the rulings would be based on legal analysis. Republicans vow to repeal ObamaCare Inside the Health Care Law Supreme Court sides with Obama Stinging loss for Republicans The same poll found only 13% of respondents believed that justices generally base their decisions on legal analysis, while 76% believed they were sometimes influenced by personal views. At the same time, polls show public approval of the nation\u2019s highest court dipping near or below 50%, which is on the low side of a rating that has exceeded 70% in the past but is historically volatile. For example, a CNN/ORC International poll in April showed that 50% of respondents approved of how the Supreme Court handled its job, with 41% disapproving and 9% offering no opinion. Ruling cements Obama\u2019s political legacy To Nan Aron, president of the left-leaning Alliance for Justice, the Supreme Court\u2019s role in the 2000 presidential election through the Bush v. Gore case cemented the perception that the justices were guided by political ideology. \u201cClearly the public sees the courts as similar to Congress \u2013 the branch where politics trumps everything else,\u201d Aron told CNN before the health care ruling was handed down. Now-retired Justice John Paul Stevens warned of that very eventuality in his dissent in the Bush v. Gore ruling, writing that although the nation may never be completely certain of who won the 2000 election, the identity of the loser was \u201cperfectly clear.\u201d \u201cIt is the nation\u2019s confidence in the judges as an impartial guardian of the rule of law,\u201d Stevens wrote. Such a dynamic may seem inevitable in an era of stark partisan divide in the country, but court watchers said it shouldn\u2019t be that way. \u201cPrecisely because everything is so polarized, there should be one branch of government that people on both sides of the aisle can view as deciding on the basis of law rather than politics, because these issues are so contested,\u201d said Jeffrey Rosen, the legal affairs editor for The New Republic, in a recent interview on NPR. Opinion: Ruling a Frankenstein\u2019s Monster Connie Severino, chief counsel and policy director for the right-leaning Judicial Crisis Network, said on the same NPR program that the Supreme Court \u201chas always maintained a position of being the most revered branch of government.\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen is a general decrease of public perception of government, and the court has kind of been dragged down along with it,\u201d Severino added. In one way, Thursday\u2019s ruling altered a perception in recent years that a conservative majority on the court led by Chief Justice John Roberts held sway. This time, Roberts joined the court\u2019s liberal wing in the health care ruling and wrote the majority opinion, which Scotusblog.com founder Tom Goldstein predicted would change the public view of the court. Roberts\u2019 role in the decision \u201cinsulates the court and by extension him from criticism for the next 10 years that it\u2019s just a partisan place that\u2019s looking for political outcomes,\u201d Goldstein told Bloomberg Law. Romney's health care response Had Roberts sided Thursday with the other four conservatives \u2013 Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy \u2013 the liberal reaction would surely have been as heated as the anger on the political right. \u201cThis is truly a turning point in American history. We\u2019ll never be the same way again,\u201d complained Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a leading tea party voice against the health care law. She called the ruling \u201ca more far-reaching decision than anyone had expected or imagined.\u201d Gergen: Are voters ready to move on? Scalia added to the perception of politicized justices this week in his dissent of a Monday case on Arizona\u2019s immigration law in which he, Alito and Thomas opposed the majority, which included Roberts and Kennedy. In the dissent, Scalia criticized the Obama administration\u2019s recent policy shift to halt deportations of some young illegal immigrants and complained that the government failed to enforce immigration laws, leaving border states unprotected. A Washington Post editorial Thursday said Scalia\u2019s \u201clapses of judicial temperament\u201d hurt the dignity of his office and endangered \u201cnot only his jurisprudential legacy but the legitimacy of the high court.\u201d In recent years, 5-4 decisions reflected the conservative majority in some high-profile cases such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission of 2010, which opened the electoral process to unlimited private funding without full disclosure. Roberts sided with his fellow conservatives in those cases, while four justices considered to the left \u2013 Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and the now-retired Stevens \u2013 supported the politically liberal stance. Since then, Elena Kagan, another perceived liberal, succeeded Stevens on the high court. The party affiliation of the president who nominated the justices matches the political affiliation now associated with each. Roberts, Alito, Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy all were put forward by Republicans, while Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan were nominated by Democrats. \u201cThe court is agreeing to hear many more controversial cases and rendering 5-4 rulings in these cases, which have the effect of politicizing its decision-making,\u201d Aron said, adding that \u201cwith Citizens United, the inside game has become much more apparent now to many more Americans.\u201d What the ruling means to you Asked if Bush v. Gore had instigated the shift in public perception that the high court was politically motivated, Aron responded: \u201cI think that\u2019s right.\u201d Severino, however, rejected the argument that a single ruling or set of rulings showed any particular political leaning by justices. Harsh reactions follow rulings in any high-profile case, she said, noting the continued public division over the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that legalized abortion. \u201cThe fact that a decision like Roe v. Wade was 7-2, something none of us would consider a close case \u2026 and yet has continued to be possibly the most divisive case certainly in this last century by the court, I think that shows that it\u2019s not all about just the vote count,\u201d she said on the NPR program. \u201cIt\u2019s about the public perception of whether the court is really being political or is actually deciding based on the law.\u201d An even more one-sided ruling, the 9-0 decision on Brown v. Board of Education that ended school segregation in 1954, also prompted a public outcry, including calls to impeach then-Chief Justice Earl Warren, Aron noted. The desegregation ruling \u201cgalvanized a base of people particularly in the South who were very opposed to that,\u201d she said. She added that Roe v. Wade led to further right-wing dissatisfaction with the high court that manifested itself in the nominations of conservative justices by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s. Opinion: The Supreme Court punts More recently, major rulings have followed the 5-4 breakdown, including the Parents v. Seattle School District and Meredith v. Jefferson Co. Board of Education affirmative action cases in 2007, the District of Columbia v. Heller gun control case in 2008 and the Citizens United case. Shortly after the Citizens United ruling, Obama added to the politicizing of Supreme Court issues by challenging the decision in his State of the Union address as six of the nine justices sat nearby in the packed Congress chamber. \u201cWith all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests \u2014 including foreign corporations \u2014 to spend without limit in our elections,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cI don\u2019t think American elections should be bankrolled by America\u2019s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities.\u201d As Obama spoke, Alito appeared to mouth the words \u201cnot true.\u201d Severino, speaking to CNN before the health care rulings, questioned Obama\u2019s public criticism of the justices back then, saying the court\u2019s role is to decide if \u201ca law is within the constitutional authority of the Congress\u201d and nothing more. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a Supreme Court to gauge which way the country\u2019s going,\u201d Severino said. \u201cWe have an elected legislature for that.\u201d Rosen, however, said in the NPR interview that \u201cif it\u2019s really a novel argument, and reasonable people can disagree, courts are supposed to defer to the political process and not second-guess it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Keating Holland and Bill Mears contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Obama expresses concern about racial profiling Arizona's governor says the heart of the law remains intact Three other key parts opposed by the federal government get struck down Justices differ on the power of the federal government versus the states The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down key parts of an Arizona law that sought to deter illegal immigration, but let stand a controversial provision allowing police to check a person\u2019s immigration status while enforcing other laws. In a decision sure to ripple across the political landscape in a presidential election year, the court\u2019s 5-3 ruling upheld the authority of the federal government to set immigration policy and laws. \u201cThe National Government has significant power to regulate immigration,\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion. \u201cArizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\u201d Read the Supreme Court ruling But while concluding that the federal government has the power to block the law, the court let stand one of the most controversial parts: a provision that lets police check a person\u2019s immigration status while enforcing other laws if \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d exists that the person is in the United States illegally. Critics said that law opens the door to racial profiling. \u201cThere is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced,\u201d Kennedy wrote, making clear that Arizona authorities must comply with federal law in conducting the immigration status checks or face further constitutional challenges. The ruling at a glance Court to Arizona: You went too far Toobin: I have sympathy for AZ officers Arpaio: SCOTUS ruling a victory for AZ SCOTUS rules on Arizona immigration law The Arizona Department of Public Safety and the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether authorities would begin checking motorists\u2019 immigration status while enforcing other laws. They referred questions to the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office, which did not immediately return a call Monday from CNN seeking comment, but Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer told reporters she expected the provision would go into effect immediately. Brewer, a Republican who signed the legislation, called the decision \u201ca victory for the people of Arizona and for America.\u201d In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cJohn King USA,\u201d she said Arizona police and sheriff\u2019s deputies have been trained to avoid racial profiling, \u201cand they don\u2019t profile.\u201d President Barack Obama also expressed concern that immigration status checks allowed by Monday\u2019s ruling could lead to racial profiling by police. In a written statement, Obama said, \u201cNo American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like.\u201d And his administration said it would not assist Arizona\u2019s efforts. Administration officials announced Thursday that they have canceled agreements that allowed some Arizona police departments to enforce federal immigration laws, and the Justice Department set up a telephone hotline and e-mail address for the public to report civil rights concerns about the law\u2019s enforcement. Immigration fight changes Arizona, groups say Brewer responded angrily to the decision, calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cI think this is another assault on the state of Arizona,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt began with them downplaying our border problem and them not securing it, and then, you know, suing the state of Arizona for trying to protect the people of Arizona and of America, then doing backdoor amnesty.\u201d Brewer told reporters earlier that she expected further lawsuits on the immigration status checks, adding, \u201cthis certainly is not the end of our journey.\u201d Opponents of the Arizona law have dubbed the immigration-status provision the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law, arguing that it unfairly targets Latinos. \u201cI know they will not be using that kind of tactic on people with the last name Roberts, Romney, or Brewer, but if your name is something like Gutierrez or Chung or Obama, watch out,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois. \u201cThe express goal of the authors of Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 is to make life miserable for immigrants so that they will leave, and a key tool in that effort was upheld by the court.\u201d And Rep. Charles Gonzalez, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told \u201cJohn King USA\u201d that he expects the Arizona law will lead to racial profiling \u201con a grand scale\u201d and eventually come back before the court. \u201cMy prediction is that the other shoe will drop, and that this fourth provision will be ruled unconstitutional,\u201d said Gonzalez, D-Texas. Meanwhile, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Obama\u2019s presumptive Republican challenger in November\u2019s election, blamed the president for what he called a \u201cmuddle\u201d left in the wake of the court\u2019s ruling. Key parts of immigration law rejected Voices of Arizona immigration Gillespie on Romney's immigration plan Obama: Congress should fix immigration \u201cThe president promised in his campaign that in his first year, he would take on immigration and solve our immigration challenges, put in place a long-term program to care for those who want to come here legally, to deal with illegal immigration, to deal with securing our borders,\u201d Romney said during a campaign stop in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cAll these things he was going to in his first year. He had a Democrat House and a Democrat Senate, but he didn\u2019t do it. Isn\u2019t it time for the American people to ask him why?\u201d But Gonzalez said Romney \u201cknows better.\u201d \u201cIt has not been the Democrats in Congress who have pushed back, it has been the Republicans,\u201d he said. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on immigration ruling: We won The Arizona law generated immediate controversy after Brewer signed it in April 2010. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a travel alert for Arizona, and dozens of groups canceled meetings or conventions. The federal government challenged four provisions of the Arizona law that never were enforced, pending the legal ruling. Provisions struck down included: \u2013 Authorizing police to arrest illegal immigrants without warrant where \u201cprobable cause\u201d exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country. \u2013 Making it a state crime for \u201cunauthorized immigrants\u201d to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification. \u2013 Forbidding those not authorized for employment in the United States to apply, solicit or perform work. That would include illegal immigrants standing in a parking lot who \u201cgesture or nod\u201d their willingness to be employed. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling appropriately bars the state of Arizona from effectively criminalizing unlawful status in the state and confirms the federal government\u2019s exclusive authority to regulate in the area of immigration,\u201d Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. But Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday\u2019s ruling \u201cessentially puts an end to immigration enforcement since the states no longer can step in and fill the void created by the Obama administration.\u201d Opinion: A changing national mood on immigration? The high court majority in the case included Kennedy, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Steven Breyer, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan did not hear the case. Before taking the bench last year, she had been involved in the administration\u2019s initial legal opposition to the law as solicitor general. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the minority, argued the court\u2019s ruling encroaches on Arizona\u2019s sovereign powers. \u201cIf securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State,\u201d Scalia wrote in a dissent backed by Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. Supporters of the Arizona measure contend the federal government has failed to enforce existing immigration laws, leaving it to states to take their own steps to deal with mounting economic and social problems caused by illegal immigrants. On Monday, two senior administration officials said the Department of Homeland Security expects increased requests from Arizona police to check the immigration status of suspects. However, they said the department will get involved only in high-priority cases such as felony offenders, repeat immigration violators or newly arrived illegal immigrants. Winners, losers in immigration policy debate? The policy reflects the department\u2019s policy of prioritizing how it spends its resources, the officials said. Such prioritizing of resources was cited as the basis for a recent decision to halt deportations of some young illegal immigrants who came to America as children, had clean records and were students or served in the military. In his dissent, Scalia noted such selective enforcement of immigration laws, writing, \u201cTo say, as the Court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of the Immigration Act that the President declines to enforce boggles the mind.\u201d Several other states followed Arizona\u2019s lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. Arizona\u2019s appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. \u201cHopefully today\u2019s decision will spur the federal government to enforce the rule of law in the immigration arena,\u201d said a statement by Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange. \u201cMy office will be reviewing today\u2019s decision to determine the full extent of its impact on Alabama\u2019s law and the pending litigation.\u201d Dan Kowalski, editor-in-chief of Bender\u2019s Immigration Bulletin and an immigration lawyer at the Fowler Law Firm in Austin, Texas, said Monday\u2019s ruling means states have to \u201creally almost go back to square one and really rethink their approach and how much time and money they want to put into these types of statutes.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to spend a lot of money on lawyers to try to craft something that they think can withstand Supreme Court scrutiny,\u201d he said, adding that states also will \u201chave to budget money for further litigation because, no matter what they propose on a state level, it\u2019s going to be challenged. That costs a lot of money. So they\u2019re going to have to figure out if it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Fed up with illegal immigrants crossing from Mexico \u2013 and what they say is the federal government\u2019s inability to stop it \u2013 legislators in Arizona passed the tough immigration law in 2010. The federal government sued, saying that Arizona overreached. At issue was whether states have any authority to step in to regulate immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional issue is known as pre-emption. Lens on immigration: Adolescence deported Arizona is the nation\u2019s most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. The case reached the Supreme Court after federal courts had blocked four elements of the state\u2019s Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, known as SB 1070. The Justice Department said Arizona\u2019s population of 2 million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or \u201cremovals\u201d involve Mexican nationals. The Pew Hispanic Center recently issued a report that found that Mexican immigration to the United States has come to a standstill. The economic downturn in the United States and better conditions in Mexico, along with deportations and other enforcement, have led many to return to Mexico. However, the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants \u2013 from Mexico and other countries \u2013 continue to live in the United States. The Obama administration said Monday that it has increased both Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement staffing and taken other steps that helped cut border apprehensions in half since 2008. Even if immigration has slowed to lows not seen in decades, proponents of tough immigration laws want to beef up enforcement ahead of any future pressures.

            "article_content": "Supreme Court ruling leaves immigration reform virtually unchanged Federal government is unwilling to remedy the immigration problem, says Justice Scalia Congress last attempted immigration reform unsuccessfully in 2006 Congressional action on immigration is unlikely until after the election After two years of protests, boycotts and lawsuits over Arizona\u2019s immigration law, Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision leaves the state of immigration reform almost unchanged with states frustrated and Congress avoiding the debate. \u201cI would guess [Congress] won\u2019t touch this with a 10-foot pole until after they come back after the election,\u201d Charles H. Kuck, managing partner at Kuck Immigration Partners in Atlanta, told CNN. The court\u2019s 5-3 ruling was a split decision, upholding the law\u2019s most controversial feature \u2013 the \u201cshow your papers provision\u201d that allows police to check a person\u2019s immigration status while enforcing other laws \u2013 but also dismissing the Arizona\u2019s right to regulate immigration at the state level. Court mostly rejects Arizona law; governor says \u2018heart\u2019 remains Justice Antonin Scalia, in his dissenting opinion, sympathized with Arizona, which cited the federal government\u2019s inaction in controlling illegal immigration as part of the basis for its law. Court to Arizona: You went too far Ariz. Gov. Brewer: This is not the end Arpaio: We'll continue to enforce laws \u201c[Arizona\u2019s] citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their social services and even place their lives in jeopardy,\u201d Scalia wrote. He also used his dissenting opinion to take a swipe at the Obama administration, which earlier this month announced it would allow some young illegal immigrants to stay in the country if they met certain conditions. \u201cFederal officials have been unable to remedy the problem, and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to do so,\u201d Scalia continued. \u201cThousands of Arizona\u2019s estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants \u2013 including not just children but men and women under 30 \u2013 are now assured immunity from enforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Arizona citizens for employment.\u201d It has been six years since Congress\u2019 last real effort to reform the federal immigration system and address the approximately 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Then-Sen. Arlen Specter introduced a bill co-sponsored by fellow Republicans Sam Brownback, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Hagel, Mel Martinez, John McCain and Democrat Ted Kennedy that contained an amnesty provision for illegal immigrants who had been in the country for a long period. But the bill couldn\u2019t get through the House, where the amnesty provision was a nonstarter. After another effort failed the following year, then-President George W. Bush expressed his disappointment that the effort failed. \u201cCongress really needs to prove to the American people that it can come together on hard issues,\u201d Bush said. Most recently, a Senate version of the DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for students in the country illegally, ended up stalling, and that left President Barack Obama to take matters into his own hands earlier this month. His action drew a rash of criticism from congressional Republicans who said the president used his directive to stop prosecution of some young illegal immigrants to get around the system. \u201cAmericans should be outraged that President Obama is planning to usurp the constitutional authority of the United States Congress and grant amnesty by edict to 1 million illegal aliens,\u201d said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, in response to Obama\u2019s announcement. With a bitterly split Congress, it\u2019s unlikely any action will be taken on immigration reform before the election. Voices of Arizona immigration Toobin: I have sympathy for AZ officers Romney's view of Arizona immigration law \u201cI think it would be difficult to imagine that things would change dramatically and we would see congressional movement on this issue,\u201d Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said. But \u201c\u2026the longer we wait, the worse this situation becomes.\u201d But that could be the case, depending on the outcome of not only the presidential race but also congressional races that will determine which party controls the House and Senate. The last immigration effort came in an atmosphere of far less partisanship and still failed after two years of grinding legislative work. Inaction on the issue will likely not sit well with Americans who overwhelmingly supported Arizona\u2019s immigration law. A CNN/ORC International poll taken in May showed more than half of Republicans, independents and Democrats favored the law. Republicans faulted Obama for his lack of action on immigration during the first two years in office when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. \u201cPresident Obama had two years with full control with the Senate and the House.  Why didn\u2019t he bring up illegal immigration?\u201d said Rita Bonilla, a member of Secured Borders USA and an immigration activist for \u201cYou Don\u2019t Speak for Me!,\u201d which supports the Arizona immigration law. Mitt Romney, Obama\u2019s presumptive presidential opponent, criticized him again after the court\u2019s announcement for the same reason. \u201cPresident Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration. This represents yet another broken promise by this president,\u201d Romney said in a statement. \u201cAs candidate Obama, he promised to present an immigration plan during his first year in office.  But four years later, we are still waiting.\u201d But Obama, in a statement released Monday, indicated he was willing to work on immigration reform. \u201cI will work with anyone in Congress who\u2019s willing to make progress on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses our economic needs and security needs, and upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants,\u201d Obama said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that Congress should take up immigration reform in a news conference Monday, referring to the Arizona immigration law as that \u201cawful law.\u201d \u201c[The ruling] is a reminder that the ultimate responsibility for fixing the nation\u2019s broken immigration system rests with Congress,\u201d Reid said. Vargas agrees. \u201cStates cannot create their different immigration schemes.  [Immigration reform] is not a fix for the states; this is a fix for the federal government. So our federal officials need to come together to address immigration reform,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The vote would be the first of its kind in U.S. House history White House spokesman Jay Carney calls the Republican investigation \"politically motivated\" Elijah Cummings urges the House speaker to meet with Holder The U.S. House is expected to vote this week for the first time in history to cite a sitting U.S. attorney general for contempt of Congress, a GOP leadership aide told CNN on Monday. The vote is scheduled for Thursday, said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record. The House Oversight Committee recommended the vote against Attorney General Eric Holder last week after he refused to hand over all of the requested documents in its investigation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms\u2019 controversial Fast and Furious gun-running sting. The vote came after President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel. The White House move means the Department of Justice can withhold some of the documents. House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa said Sunday that Obama\u2019s invocation of executive privilege is either \u201cover broad, or simply wrong.\u201d A brief history of 'Fast and Furious' Watch lawmakers vote on Holder DNC chair: GOP witch hunt on Holder \u201cWe\u2019re past that part of the discovery, relative to contempt, Issa said. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of wrong things and we want to fix it. What we\u2019re talking about now, when we get lied to, when the American people get lied to, there can\u2019t be oversight when there\u2019s lying. \u201cThe Supreme Court held pretty clearly there cannot be executive privilege over a criminal cover-up,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Lying to Congress is a crime. We have every right to see documents to say, \u2018Did you know?\u2019 \u2018What did you know?\u2019 including even the president.\u201d However, he added, \u201cIf we get documents that do show, cast some doubt, or allow us to understand this, we\u2019ll at least delay contempt and continue the process. We only broke off negotiations when we got a flat refusal when we asked to get information needed for our investigation.\u201d If the documents say what Holder claims they say, \u201cwe might dismiss contempt,\u201d he said. Issa said last week he was surprised by Obama\u2019s action and questioned whether the White House\u2019s role in Fast and Furious \u201chas been greater than previously acknowledged.\u201d Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN he previously traced the program only up to the level of an assistant attorney general. \u201cNow it raises the question of what does the president know and when did he know it by the claim of executive privilege,\u201d said Grassley, who participated in last week\u2019s meeting. Meanwhile, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland and the ranking member of the oversight committee, called on House Speaker John Boehner to meet with Holder to resolve the dispute. \u201cI\u2019m calling on Speaker Boehner to come forth and show the strong leadership that I know he will, and sit down with the attorney general to resolve this matter,\u201d Cummings said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe attorney general has made it clear that he is willing to work with this Congress.\u201d Holder contempt vote could come this week White House spokesman Jay Carney has called the Republican investigation a \u201cpolitically motivated, taxpayer funded, election year fishing expedition.\u201d And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has said Republicans are targeting Hlder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has said Republicans are targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. Holder said on Thursday his offer to turn over some of the documents sought by House Republicans still stands. But Issa told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that absent the documents, the full House will vote Holder in contempt. A number of Democrats have appealed to the administration to be forthcoming, he said, and \u201cmany of them will stay with us.\u201d Last week\u2019s events heightened the drama of the high-profile showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program, which dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapon purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa\u2019s committee is seeking documents that show why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about Fast and Furious. However, Holder has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama to assert executive privilege over such documents last week. Boehner, R-Ohio, has said the executive privilege assertion proved White House involvement and indicated a cover-up, which Carney rejected. Issa and other Republicans on the panel have mentioned Terry\u2019s death by name in accusing Holder and the Justice Department of trying to stonewall the investigation of what happened. \u201cThe Department of Justice has fought this investigation every step of the way,\u201d Issa said last week. \u201cAt the heart of the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious are disastrous consequences: a murdered Border Patrol Agent, his grieving family seeking answers, countless deaths in Mexico, and the souring effect on our relationship with Mexico,\u201d Issa said in a statement. \u201cCongress has not just a right but an obligation to do all that it can to uncover exactly what happened and ensure that it never occurs again. \u201c See letter to Issa from deputy attorney general (.PDF) Terry\u2019s family issued a statement Wednesday that called for all of the documents sought by the committee to be turned over. \u201cOur son lost his life protecting this nation, and it is very disappointing that we are now faced with an administration that seems more concerned with protecting themselves rather than revealing the truth behind Operation Fast and Furious,\u201d the statement said. The mother of another federal agent said Wednesday she wants to know the \u201cfull truth\u201d about his death. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata, who was working for the United States in Mexico, was murdered in February 2011 when his vehicle was ambushed on a highway between Mexico City and Monterrey. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, last year said he wanted to know if a Texas-based \u201cgun walking\u201d program may have played a role in Zapata\u2019s murder. He said one of the weapons used in the slaying was allegedly purchased in Texas and trafficked to Mexico. CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

Lamar Smith: \"Bad news for border states\" Message to the states: \"This is a federal issue,\" Charles Kuck says \"Back to square one,\" says immigration lawyer Dan Kowalski \"A resounding defeat\" for state efforts to enact immigration law, a lawyer says The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Arizona\u2019s attempt to legislate immigration is likely to have far-reaching effects on other states\u2019 efforts to enact similar legislation and underscores the need for federal action, experts said Monday. The decision is \u201ca resounding defeat for the legislators of Arizona and other parts of the United States who think that immigration can be regulated at the state level,\u201d said Charles H. Kuck, managing partner at Kuck Immigration Partners in Atlanta. He predicted Monday\u2019s decision will affect Alabama, South Carolina, Indiana, Utah as well as Arizona. The court\u2019s message to each state is the same, he said: \u201cThis is a federal issue.\u201d Supreme Court mostly rejects Arizona immigration law The big question now, he said, is what Congress will do to fix the immigration problem. But he doesn\u2019t expect any immediate movement. \u201cI would guess they won\u2019t touch this with a 10-foot pole until after they come back after the election.\u201d In a written statement, President Barack Obama vowed to work with \u201canyone in Congress who\u2019s willing to make progress on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses our economic needs and security needs, and upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\u201d The attorney general of Alabama, Luther Strange, issued a statement expressing the hope that the decision will \u201cspur the federal government to enforce the rule of law in the immigration arena.\u201d Georgia\u2019s attorney general, Sam Olens, noting Arizona\u2019s law was partially upheld, said he is looking forward to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals\u2019 proceedings \u201cregarding Georgia\u2019s immigration reform law in the light of this decision.\u201d Arpaio: We'll continue to enforce laws Voices of Arizona immigration Monday\u2019s ruling means states have to \u201creally almost go back to square one and really rethink their approach and how much time and money they want to put into these types of statutes,\u201d said Dan Kowalski, editor-in-chief of Bender\u2019s Immigration Bulletin and an immigration lawyer at the Fowler Law Firm in Austin, Texas. \u201cNumber one: They\u2019re going to have to spend a lot of money on lawyers to try to craft something that they think can withstand Supreme Court scrutiny; Number two: they\u2019re going to have to budget money for further litigation because, no matter what they propose on a state level, it\u2019s going to be challenged. That costs a lot of money. So they\u2019re going to have to figure out if it\u2019s worth it.\u201d That gets to a fundamental question of what the purpose is behind such an immigration law, he said. \u201cDoes it make economic sense for the states to try to clamp down on immigration or is it merely an expression of some sort of cultural distress or worry about change in demographics? So that\u2019s going to have to be on the minds of legislators at every state level.\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-New York, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, applauded the majority opinion. \u201cThis decision tells us that states cannot take the law into their own hands and makes it clear that the only real solution to immigration reform is a comprehensive federal law,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cThe decision should importune Republicans and Democrats to work together on this issue in a bipartisan way.\u201d Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, disagreed with the decision but agreed that it is now up to Congress to act. \u201cThe majority opinion scrupulously ignores 200 years of jurisprudence in history that says Congress can delegate to the states specific authority,\u201d Stein told CNN. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on immigration ruling: We won \u201cEverything that the majority opinion said was wrong with the Arizona law could be remedied by Congress stepping up to the plate.\u201d This year, five states introduced bills similar to Arizona\u2019s, and none has been enacted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Bills in Mississippi, Missouri and West Virginia failed. Kansas ended its legislative session without passage and Rhode Island\u2019s legislative session is scheduled to end July 2. Alabama amended its 2011 law, eliminating a provision that allowed a citizen to bring legal action to enforce immigration law and amending other parts. And the number of bills and resolutions related to immigrants and refugees dropped 44% in the first quarter of 2012, from 1,538 bills the year before to 865, the conference said. A number of factors were involved, the conference said in a statement, \u201cBut most significantly, legislators cited the pending ruling from the Supreme Court on the extent of states\u2019 authority in immigration enforcement as a reason to postpone state action.\u201d \u201cIn terms of future legislation, I think all states will be looking at the Supreme Court case to determine where they might have room to be engaged in immigrant policy-making and where they\u2019re prohibited from doing so,\u201d said Sheri Steisel, who directs the conference\u2019s task force on immigrant policy and the states. States have been acting on their own \u201cbecause of a lack of federal immigration reform,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly hope that the federal government will be able to find a way to develop bipartisan policy in this area. Since they have not, it has left a real policy vacuum for the states to deal with.\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, expressed disappointment over the decision. \u201cUnfortunately, under this administration, today\u2019s ruling essentially puts an end to immigration enforcement since the states no longer can step in and fill the void created by the Obama administration,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis is especially bad news for border states since they have to deal with border violence, drug trafficking and illegal immigration.\u201d Analysis: Five things we learned from Supreme Court\u2019s immigration ruling",

            "article_content": "Both Obama and Romney to speak to Latino officials and activists in Florida Hispanic vote in Florida could tip balance in key battleground state Democrats' lead among Florida Hispanics is growing, according to research center Republicans counter that Latinos will vote on Obama's economic record President Obama and Mitt Romney are set to make appearances beginning Thursday at a major gathering of Latino officials and activists in Florida, a moment that campaign-weary Democrats have awaited for weeks. Obama\u2019s strategists relish any chance to drive a wedge between Romney and Hispanic voters, and at the annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, the president is all-but-certain to paint Romney as beholden to anti-immigrant elements of his party\u2019s conservative base. It\u2019s an article of faith inside the Obama campaign\u2019s Chicago headquarters that the country\u2019s shifting demographics \u2013 particularly growing Hispanic communities that lean Democratic in several swing states \u2013 might be enough to put the election out of reach for Romney, no matter how sluggish the economy is. Few locales will test that theory in November better than the host city for the NALEO conference: Orlando, ground zero for Florida\u2019s rapidly expanding Latino population. How can Republicans attract voters other than old white men Obama counting on Latino stars Counting on the Latino vote Latino vote up for grabs \u201cThe combination of demographics and the issue narrative in Orlando could be the difference between 29 electoral votes or not,\u201d said Steve Schale, who managed Obama\u2019s winning 2008 campaign in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the areas where President Obama could grow from 2008.\u201d Until Obama\u2019s victory, Orange County, home to Orlando and Disney World, had developed a well-earned reputation as one of Florida\u2019s premier battlegrounds. The county was decided by fewer than 6,000 votes in every presidential election going back to 1996. That all changed in 2008, when Obama carried the county by 85,000 votes against John McCain. In April, Schale, who maintains a blog devoted to Sunshine State political math that\u2019s closely followed by operatives in both parties, began combing through Census data and voter registration numbers in an effort to gauge whether Obama\u2019s Orlando blowout in 2008 was an aberration or the new normal in Florida campaigns. His findings, outlined in a post titled \u201cOrlando Rising,\u201d underscore the Obama campaign\u2019s demographics-as-destiny argument. Defining the Orlando metro area as Orange, Seminole and Osceola counties, Shale mapped out several unmistakably positive trends for Democrats: \u2022 The Orlando area\u2019s population jumped by 436,000 people between 2000 and 2010, from 1.4 million residents to 1.85 million. African-Americans and Puerto Ricans, who tend to vote Democratic, accounted for more than half of that growth. \u2022 Between October 2006 and January 2012, the region added about 84,000 new voters and three quarters of those were African-American or Hispanic. The vast majority of new voters registered as Democrats. Over the same period, the share of the white vote in Orlando increased by only 7%. \u2022 In 1994, Republicans accounted for 50% of registered voters in the three sprawling counties surrounding Orlando. That number has now dropped to 33%. At the same time, 41% of Orlando voters are now Democrats, with the remainder not registering in either party. Will Obama\u2019s immigration initiative sway Latinos? Similar population changes are happening across Florida. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 lead among Hispanic voters has grown just in the last four years,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. Latinos now comprise 13% of the Florida electorate, up from 11% in 2008. More Latinos are now registered as Democrats than as Republicans, a reversal from previous election cycles. At first glance, those shifts may seem modest. But in a huge state where the race may come down to a few thousand votes, any mathematical edge matters greatly. The fluid nature of the state\u2019s electorate is driven in large part by an influx of Puerto Ricans \u2013 who are eligible vote the moment they arrive because of Puerto Rico\u2019s status as a U.S. territory \u2013 along with growing Dominican, Colombian, Mexican and Venezuelan populations. Puerto Ricans are now the second largest Hispanic group in the state after Cuban-Americans, a Republican-leaning bloc that has seen its share of the statewide vote decline as other Latino communities grow at a faster clip. Strategists in both parties say Florida\u2019s decade-long Hispanic boom is most visible around Orlando, now the second-largest hub of Puerto Ricans in the country outside of New York. Neighborhoods like Kissimmee, Buenaventura Lakes and Meadow Woods, which hugs Orlando International Airport, have become hot spots for Obama campaign organizers. Among Florida\u2019s largest counties, Orange County\u2019s Hispanic population grew by 83% between 2000 and 2010, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Navarette: Avoid assumptions about Latinos immigration status That\u2019s faster than in Miami-Dade, Broward or Palm Beach County \u2014 three huge and reliably Democratic counties in south Florida. Courting the Puerto Rican vote in Orlando is now an essential part of any Florida campaign itinerary, as vital as throwing back a shot of sugar-packed coffee in front of reporters at Versailles Restaurant in Miami\u2019s Little Havana. \u201cThere is not a political visit in Orlando that doesn\u2019t include a stop at a Puerto Rican community center or gathering place,\u201d said Ana Navarro, a Republican fundraiser and strategist from Miami. The changing face of Orlando has profound implications for the state\u2019s political geography. In the modern era, Democrats have won statewide races with robust turnout in South Florida. Republicans usually rely on northern part of the state \u2014 from Pensacola in the Panhandle to Jacksonville in the east \u2013 and on places like Sarasota and Naples along the Gulf coast. And slicing through the central part of the state is Interstate 4, the highway connecting Tampa to Orlando. The \u201cI-4 Corridor\u201d has become a byword for the suburban midsection of the state where swing voters and transplants from the Midwest often decide elections. Opinion: What Latinos want from candidates? Respect Tampa, the state\u2019s largest media market, continues to grow but retains much of its essential political character. Meanwhile, the ballooning Puerto Rican population just 80 miles up the road has Orlando looking, politically speaking, more and more like South Florida \u2013 a potential Democratic stronghold in the heart of central Florida\u2019s political battlefield. Both campaigns know what\u2019s at stake. The Obama campaign and the Republican National Committee have opened multiple offices in Orlando and are engaged in Hispanic voter contact efforts. Underscoring the metro area\u2019s importance, the Orlando media market currently ranks second nationally in television ad spending from the campaigns and outside groups. Roughly $10 million worth of ads have aired in Orlando, including several Spanish-language ads from the Obama campaign. Obama campaign hands in Chicago and Florida are confident that the GOP\u2019s tough talk on immigration policy \u2013 Romney has embraced elements of Arizona\u2019s tough immigration law and said he would veto the DREAM Act, for instance \u2013 will push Florida\u2019s various Hispanic communities into the Democratic fold in November. Why older Latinos matter in election Gabriela Domenzain, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, also said Romney\u2019s opposition to the Supreme Court confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor, a Puerto Rican, will hurt him in Orlando. \u201cMitt Romney is on the wrong side of every issue important to Puerto Ricans,\u201d Domenzain said. \u201cThe community cannot afford his insistence on repeating the failed economic policies that brought our economy to the brink of collapse, his belief that we should let foreclosures \u2018hit the bottom\u2019 or his commitment to slashing our health care and education.\u201d Because of their citizenship status, Puerto Ricans are not directly affected by the president\u2019s decision last week to halt the deportation of young people who were brought to the country illegally. But Lynette Acosta, an Obama campaign co-chair and organizer in Orlando, said her fellow Puerto Ricans feel a kinship with other Hispanics affected by the law. \u201cWe do gravitate to each other,\u201d Acosta told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense a loyalty we feel to other Hispanics. At the same time, the campaign is doing well because that they haven\u2019t taken for granted that the Hispanic community is monolithic.\u201d Republicans accuse the Obama campaign of playing identity politics. They point to the sputtering economy as the primary issue for voters, regardless of ethnicity. \u2018Sleeping giant\u2019 Latino vote yet to awaken Issues like homelessness and foreclosures continue to be pressing matters in central Florida. \u201cLike in every other state, and like every other American, Hispanics in Florida are laser focused on the economy,\u201d said Bettina Inclan, the Republican National Committee\u2019s director of Hispanic outreach. \u201cThis administration tries to do a lot of things so they don\u2019t have to talk about Obama\u2019s economic record.\u201d GOP strategists also note that Puerto Ricans are more independent than most political observers give them credit for. Two Orlando-area Puerto Rican leaders, for instance, are running in the Republican primary in the state\u2019s newly drawn 9th Congressional District. Navarro, the Miami GOP fundraiser, said Jeb Bush, the state\u2019s former Republican governor, won successive statewide races with an aggressive Puerto Rican outreach effort in central Florida. \u201cThe Puerto Ricans in Orlando tend to lean Democrat,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cBut they can definitely swing Republican with the right candidate and the right message.\u201d To this day, Bush consistently calls on the GOP to temper its harsh tone on immigration reform, often to little effect. One leading GOP strategist who has worked on several recent high-profile races in the state said Republicans have failed to grasp the political significance of the Florida\u2019s growing Hispanic population. \u201cIf you tried to take this current Republican brand onward for a generation, we would suffer greatly in Hispanic communities and we would face serious problems across the state,\u201d said the strategist, who did not want to be identified criticizing his party.

            "article_content": "House leaders say the full chamber could vote on contempt next week A House committee recommends a contempt citation against Attorney General Holder Democrats call the contempt measure unfair and an election year witch hunt At issue are documents the panel seeks on the botched Fast and Furious gun-running sting Voting on strictly partisan lines, a House committee recommended Wednesday that Attorney General Eric Holder be cited for contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents relating to the botched Fast and Furious weapons sting operation. The vote ended an extraordinary daylong hearing that took place after President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel investigating Fast and Furious. The White House move means the Department of Justice can withhold some of the documents. The committee measure now goes to the full House for consideration, expected next week, of what would be an unprecedented action \u2013 Congress holding a sitting attorney general in contempt. What happens if panel cites Holder for contempt? \u201cUnless the attorney general re-evaluates his choice and supplies the promised documents, the House will vote to hold him in contempt next week,\u201d said a statement by the chamber\u2019s Republican leaders. \u201cIf, however, Attorney General Holder produces these documents prior to the scheduled vote, we will give the (committee) an opportunity to review in hopes of resolving this issue.\u201d DNC chair: GOP witch hunt on Holder Obama invokes executive privilege Congressman: I believe Holder A brief history of 'Fast and Furious' All 23 Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee supported the contempt measure, while the 17 Democrats opposed it, reflecting the deep political divide on the issue. Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, refused to put off consideration of the measure, saying the White House assertion of executive privilege \u201cfalls short\u201d of any reason to delay the hearing. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history However, Issa said after the hearing that he believes a settlement to avoid an unprecedented contempt vote in the House is \u201cin the best interest of the Justice Department, Congress and those most directly affected by Operation Fast and Furious.\u201d In a statement later Wednesday, Holder called Issa\u2019s decision to hold the vote \u201can election-year tactic\u201d and \u201can extraordinary, unprecedented and entirely unnecessary action, intended to provoke an avoidable conflict between Congress and the executive branch.\u201d The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, accused Issa of setting an \u201cimpossible standard\u201d for Holder by initially demanding documents the attorney general is legally prohibited from providing. Now Issa has \u201cno interest in resolving\u201d the dispute with Holder, Cummings said. Wednesday\u2019s developments further heightened the drama of a high-profile showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program that dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year. What do you think of the controversy? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapon purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa\u2019s committee is specifically seeking documents that show why the Department of Justice decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about Fast and Furious. The stalemate over the documents escalated dramatically Wednesday. CNN senior political analyst and former presidential adviser David Gergen said such dusts-ups are usually resolved by political negotiations.That\u2019s not been the case here. \u201cFor a lot of Americans who don\u2019t understand the complexities and really don\u2019t care about the complexity of this, it is one more illustration \u2026 that Washington is broken,\u201d Gergen said. But the impasse also shows something about Holder\u2019s resolve, he told \u201cJohn King USA.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s stiffened his spine,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cHe has been under pressure to resign from some quarters in the Republican Party. He ain\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Now the question is whether a settlement can be reached before the House vote. If the House finds Holder in contempt, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted for criminal contempt, according to Alan Morrison, associated dean at George Washington University Law School. \u201cIt would look like terrible overreaching to go for criminal contempt,\u201d Morrison said, which carries a penalty of $1,000 and up to one year in prison. Instead, Morrison said, it is more likely the House would pursue civil prosecution in federal court. The House committee vote came more than six hours after notice that Obama had asserted executive privilege. In a letter to Obama seeking that action, Holder said the documents involved related to the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cresponse to congressional oversight and related media inquiries,\u201d and that release of internal executive branch documents would have \u201csignificant, damaging consequences.\u201d Holder contempt vote could come next week Holder also said releasing the documents would \u201cinhibit the candor of executive branch deliberations in the future and significantly impair the ability of the executive branch to respond independently and effectively to congressional oversight.\u201d Holder said he offered to turn over some of the documents sought by Issa when they met Tuesday in a final effort to resolve the dispute before Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Issa, however, said Holder put unreasonable conditions on his offer. In a letter to Issa after Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Deputy Attorney General James Cole reiterated Holder\u2019s position that the documents would show Holder had nothing to hide about his role in Fast and Furious. Cole noted that the lone point of dispute was whether the February 4, 2011, letter was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation. \u201cThe answer to that question is an emphatic \u2018no,\u2019 and we have offered the committee the opportunity to satisfy itself that that is so,\u201d Cole wrote. The department says it already has handed over more than 7,000 pages of records to House investigators and that the remaining material Issa wants could jeopardize criminal prosecutions. Issa and other Republicans on the panel mentioned Brian Terry\u2019s death by name in accusing Holder and the Justice Department of trying to stonewall the investigation of what happened. \u201cThe Department of Justice has fought this investigation every step of the way,\u201d Issa said. \u201cAt the heart of the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious are disastrous consequences: a murdered Border Patrol Agent, his grieving family seeking answers, countless deaths in Mexico, and the souring effect on our relationship with Mexico,\u201d Issa said in a statement. \u201cCongress has not just a right but an obligation to do all that it can to uncover exactly what happened and ensure that it never occurs again. \u201c See letter to Issa from deputy attorney general (.PDF) Terry\u2019s family issued a statement Wednesday that called for all of the documents sought by the committee to be turned over. \u201cOur son lost his life protecting this nation, and it is very disappointing that we are now faced with an administration that seems more concerned with protecting themselves rather than revealing the truth behind Operation Fast and Furious,\u201d the statement said. The mother of another federal agent said Wednesday she wants to know the \u201cfull truth\u201d about his death. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata, who was working for the United States in Mexico, was murdered in February 2011 when his vehicle was ambushed on a highway between Mexico City and Monterrey. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, last year said he wanted to know if a Texas-based \u201cgun walking\u201d program may have played a role in Zapata\u2019s murder. He said one of the weapons used in the slaying was allegedly purchased in Texas and trafficked to Mexico. \u201cUnfortunately, the situation regarding Fast and Furious as well as other gun-walking operations has been something that has damaged the lives of many,\u201d Zapata\u2019s mother, Mary, said in a statement. \u201cI would have hoped that transparency would have been a priority so that we, like so many others, could get some answers.\u201d Holder floats \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019 deal with Congress The Tuesday meeting between Issa and Holder amounted to little more than a reiteration of the positions the two staked out in an exchange of letters the previous week. \u201cAny claims that the Justice Department has been unresponsive to requests for information are untrue,\u201d Holder said, noting he shut Fast and Furious down. The subpoenas issued last year originally cited a broad array of documents, including wiretap requests and other materials involving confidential sources that Holder argued he was prevented by law from supplying. Issa narrowed the request in negotiations with Holder in recent weeks. Holder rejects resignation call at heated Senate hearing Democrats argued the documents demanded by Issa related to internal discussions about responding to the Fast and Furious investigation, rather than the committee\u2019s intended purpose of finding out who authorized the failed program. The party-line division in the panel extended to the portrayal of the Tuesday meeting attended by  Holder, Issa, Cummings and others. Issa and Republicans rejected the conditions of Holder\u2019s offer, while Cummings and Democrats said the panel should work with Holder to seek a resolution. Issa said he was surprised by Obama\u2019s action and questioned whether the White House\u2019s role in Fast and Furious \u201chas been greater than previously acknowledged.\u201d On the border: Guns, drugs \u2013 and a betrayal of trust Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN he previously traced the program only up to the level of an assistant attorney general. \u201cNow it raises the question of what does the president know and when did he know it by the claim of executive privilege,\u201d said Grassley, who participated in Tuesday\u2019s meeting. But Carl Tobias, professor at the University of Richmond\u2019s School of Law, said it does not appear Obama was involved with the Fast and Furious program. \u201cHe is trying to protect the prerogatives of the department and the people who work for him,\u201d Tobias said of the executive privilege. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that while Holder may be embarrassed, he won\u2019t ultimately be found in contempt. \u201cThis is going to be just another political dispute,\u201d Toobin told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cIf people remember at all, they\u2019ll remember 23 Republicans were for it, 17 Democrats were against it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Terry Frieden, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett , Allison Brennan and Phil Gast contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Analyst: Obama's shrewd policy shift put Republicans in a tough spot GOP leaders criticize the process, not the content, of the immigration policy change Mitt Romney, Speaker Boehner say they want comprehensive immigration reform President Obama last week halted deportations of some young illegal immigrants Caught off guard by the Obama administration\u2019s shift in immigration policy last week, Republicans on Tuesday refined their response in an effort to lessen any political bounce for the president at what had been a tough time in his campaign. Certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney led the Republican counterattack, accusing President Barack Obama of undermining the possibility of long-term immigration reform by taking the partial step of halting deportations of some young illegal immigrants who came to America as children. Speaking in an interview on Fox News Radio, Romney said Obama could have proposed immigration reform earlier in his term, when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress, but instead waited until his re-election was pending. \u201cThe reason this came out was the president is trying to shore up his base with Latino voters,\u201d Romney said, noting that Obama\u2019s campaign has struggled in recent weeks to deal with a disappointing jobs report and what he called self-inflicted wounds. \u201cHe is also trying to change the subject from his miserable speech last week, from his gaffe that the private economy is doing fine,\u201d Romney added. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, acknowledged that Obama\u2019s move \u201cputs everyone in a difficult position,\u201d telling reporters it will \u201cmake it much more difficult for us to work in a bipartisan way to get to a permanent solution.\u201d Boehner also said that the policy change might violate the Constitution and that the president made no attempt to work with Congress. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called such Republican arguments hypocritical and \u201cphony outrage.\u201d \u201cThe complaints are varied, but they have one thing in common: None of them actually take issue with the substance of President Obama\u2019s directive,\u201d Reid said, adding:  \u201cThey just don\u2019t like the way President Obama made the decision \u2013 or that he will get the credit for bringing out of the shadows 800,000 trustworthy young men and women who know no other home but the United States.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s spin by leading Republican moderates Romney and Boehner differed from the initial reaction by conservatives who called Obama\u2019s move an amnesty \u2013 a buzzword for right-wing opposition that has stymied immigration reform efforts. Now the Republican criticism focuses on the process rather than the content, and for good reason. A Bloomberg poll released Tuesday showed that a solid majority of likely voters back the policy change Obama announced Friday, including coveted independent voters. According to the survey, 64% of respondents agree with the new policy, while 30% disagree. Among independents, the percentage in agreement rises to 66%, while 26% are opposed. The poll also showed that 86% of Democrats support the new policy, while 56% of Republicans disagree with it. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, called Obama\u2019s move \u201cvery shrewd\u201d because it showed leadership on an issue important to his liberal base and the Hispanic community. \u201cThis is a major, major step toward cementing the bond between the Latino community and the Democratic Party in an active way,\u201d Schiller told CNN, adding that voters will remember that the Democrats were \u201cthe party that let me stay in this country, \u2026 that kept my family intact.\u201d In announcing the change Friday, Obama said it would make U.S. immigration policy \u201cmore fair, more efficient and more just.\u201d The new policy allows people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat and were successful students or served in the military to receive a two-year deferral from deportation. They also can apply for work permits. Administration officials emphasized that the change offers no path to citizenship or legal residency, and they said it will allow the Department of Homeland Security to focus resources on keeping out new illegal immigrants and tracking down repeat offenders, criminals and others. The policy change mimics legislation called the DREAM Act, which Democrats were unable to push through Congress in 2010 because of a Republican-led filibuster in the Senate. In that vote, five Democrats in the Senate joined Republicans in blocking the measure, while three GOP senators voted with Democrats to bring it up. The final tally of 55-41 was five votes shy of breaking the filibuster. Reid complained Tuesday that Republicans have continually resisted efforts to work with Democrats on immigration reform and the DREAM Act \u201cEvery time Democrats offer to work together on comprehensive immigration reform, Republicans find an excuse to fight sensible change,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAnd every time Democrats propose bipartisan legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for children brought here illegally through no fault of their own, Republicans find an excuse to oppose our practical reforms.\u201d After Obama announced the policy change Friday, conservative House Republicans immediately blasted it as a backdoor amnesty, with Iowa Rep. Steve King threatening to sue the administration. However, Republican aides acknowledge that immigration is a divisive issue within their party, with GOP members in competitive districts needing to appeal to Hispanic voters to win re-election this fall. To Schiller, the Obama move put Republicans in a tough spot if they oppose his policy of halting the deportations. Noting the children of illegal immigrants affected by the change had to be very young when they arrived in America with their parents, she called it \u201ca population that is impossible to paint in a negative light.\u201d \u201cHow can you support a policy that would break up families? You can\u2019t,\u201d she said. Boehner and Romney reflected that reality Tuesday. \u201cI think we all have concerns for those who are caught in this trap through no fault of their own and are here,\u201d Boehner said. Romney pledged to \u201cwork from the beginning of my administration to put in place a piece of legislation which deals with this issue on a long-term basis,\u201d saying young illegal immigrants who serve in the military \u201cshould be able to become permanent residents of the United States,\u201d a step short of full citizenship. In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, avoided a direct answer to repeated questions from reporters about his response to Obama\u2019s move, deferring instead to a speech by Romney later this week at a major Latino conference in Florida. \u201cHe is the leader of our party from now until November and we hope beyond, and we\u2019re gonna wait and hear what he has to say about it,\u201d McConnell said. Romney has endorsed efforts by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate, to draft a Republican version of the DREAM Act. Obama\u2019s move effectively ended that effort, a Rubio aide acknowledged Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re re-evaluating our plans,\u201d Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. \u201cThe president\u2019s announcement took away our momentum and made the politics a lot tougher.\u201d Rubio had planned to introduce the bill this summer, citing concerns about certain students facing deportation ahead of the new school year, but his office said the president\u2019s step erased any sense of urgency. \u201cThis approach requires a long-term solution, and my biggest concern \u2013 and I may be proven wrong \u2013 my biggest concern is that by doing it this way, the president had undermined and set back the hopes of getting a long-term solution done on this issue,\u201d Rubio told CNBC on Tuesday. Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in immigration issues, said the exceptionally bitter political divide right now made Republican calls for comprehensive immigration reform ring hollow. During the GOP primary campaign, Romney said he wanted illegal immigrants to deport themselves, \u201cmeaning if we make it miserable enough for (them), they will leave,\u201d Singer told CNN. Now his desire for comprehensive reform also sounds like campaign talk that might not translate to results should Romney win the White House in November, she said. If Obama\u2019s policy change is close to what Rubio was proposing, then both sides should be able to coalesce around it, Singer noted, adding: \u201cThe fact is that Obama has enacted something similar that doesn\u2019t somehow add up to bipartisan support, and that, my friend, is politics.\u201d Both Obama and Romney are scheduled to address the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials annual conference later this week in Florida, a key general election battleground state with a large Hispanic population. Both candidates also released Spanish-language ads this week. Romney unveiled a spot Monday attacking the president\u2019s record on the economy, while the Obama campaign released a spot Tuesday featuring Latino talk show host Cristina Saralegui, who endorsed the president after last week\u2019s policy shift, according to the campaign.

Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency\u2019s history. Friday\u2019s policy change is expected to potentially affect 800,000 people, an administration official told CNN on background. Others put the figure at potentially more than 1 million people. Hispanics make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election.

Immigration lessons for the U.S. from around the world Friday\u2019s policy change is expected to potentially affect 800,000 people, an administration official told CNN on background. Both Obama and Napolitano called for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with immigration enforcement for 20 years and the plain fact of the matter is that the law that we\u2019re working under doesn\u2019t match the economic needs of the country today and the law enforcement needs of the country today,\u201d Napolitano told CNN. \u201cBut as someone who is charged with enforcing the immigration system, we\u2019re setting good, strong, sensible priorities, and again these young people really are not the individuals that the immigration removal process was designed to focus upon.\u201d Republicans who have blocked Democratic efforts on immigration reform immediately condemned the move, with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a leading GOP foe of Democratic proposals for immigration reform, threatened to file a lawsuit asking the courts to stop Obama \u201cfrom implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy.\u201d In a Twitter post, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the decision \u201ca classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,\u201d while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, called the change a \u201cdecision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants.\u201d \u201cMany illegal immigrants will falsely claim they came here as children and the federal government has no way to check whether their claims are true,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cAnd once these illegal immigrants are granted deferred action, they can then apply for a work permit, which the administration routinely grants 90% of the time.\u201d Others complained the move will flood an already poor job market for young Americans with illegal immigrants. However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, welcomed the announcement that he said \u201cwill give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they\u2019ve ever called home.\u201d Immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides He rejected the GOP argument that Obama\u2019s move was all about politics, noting \u201cthere will be those who vote against him because of this decision, too. That\u2019s what leadership is about.\u201d Durbin also noted that Obama repeatedly called for Congress to pass immigration reform legislation, including the DREAM  Act. Now that it is clear no progress would occur this Congress, the president acted, Durbin said. Obama has used executive orders more frequently in recent months to launch initiatives he advocates that have been stymied by the deep partisan divide in Congress. A White House campaign of such steps involving economic programs was labeled \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait.\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been working on an alternative version of the DREAM Act, criticized Obama for taking a piecemeal approach Friday. He said in a statement that \u201cby once again ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress, this short-term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long-term one.\u201d Overheard on CNN.com: Decision to defer some deportations symbolic Rubio is considered a possible running mate for certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who rejected the DREAM Act in the heat of the Republican primary campaign but has since expressed willingness to consider whatever Rubio proposes. Later Friday, Romney told reporters that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order, which can be replaced by a subsequent president. He said he agrees with Rubio\u2019s statement that Obama\u2019s move makes finding a long-term solution more difficult. As president, Romney said, he would seek to provide \u201ccertainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents.\u201d Hispanics make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election. A spokeswoman for a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza, hailed the administration\u2019s move. Joy, skepticism at immigration policy shift \u201cIn light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time,\u201d said NCLR spokeswoman Laura Vazquez. Immigration lawyers also called the change a major step in the right direction. However, one immigration expert warned that the new policy does not guarantee the result sought by participants. \u201cI worry that the announcement will be implemented more stingily than the administration would like,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School. Meanwhile, some evangelical Christian leaders who recently met at the White House to discuss immigration issues also endorsed Friday\u2019s move, along with the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops and some Jewish groups.

            "article_content": "Caitlin Halligan named by Obama to U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Appointment seen by many as a professional stepping stone to the Supreme Court Her confirmation was previously blocked by Senate Republicans In a move sure to please the political left, President Obama on Monday re-nominated a New York lawyer to a prestigious seat on a federal appeals court, assuring an election-year fight with Republicans over judges. Caitlin Halligan was one of two nominees named by the president to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seen by many as a professional stepping stone to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Clarence Thomas also served on that court prior to their appointment to their current jobs. Halligan is currently general counsel for the District Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan, New York \u201cThis important court is often called the nation\u2019s second-highest court, and it stands more than a quarter vacant,\u201d said Mr. Obama. \u201cI remain deeply disappointed that a minority of the United States Senate blocked Ms. Halligan\u2019s nomination last year and urge her reconsideration, especially given her broad bipartisan support from the legal and law enforcement communities.\u201d In a rare move, Senate Republicans in December voted to block the 45-year-old Ohio native, complaining she was too liberal and would be an activist on the bench. The largely party-line vote was 54 to 45, falling shy of the required 60-vote threshold that would have ended the cloture stalemate and allow a final vote on the nomination itself. The nomination was closely watched because the DC Circuit considers so many federal cases that often end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. The was no immediate reaction to the re-nomination from Senate Republicans, and no indication when confirmation hearings would be held. The election year would complicate such a Judiciary Committee review, given its compressed schedule, and past partisan disagreement over Halligan, likely to spill over into reconsideration of her qualifications for the bench. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had said Halligan met the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard for a filibuster under a 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases. McConnell complained about Halligan\u2019s legal positions on gun rights, detainee rights, and immigration and said she would bring an activist agenda to the court. \u201cIn Ms. Halligan\u2019s view, the courts aren\u2019t so much a forum for the even-handed application of the law as a place where a judge can work out his or her own ideas of what society should look like,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor during the December debate. The four remaining Republican members of the so-called \u201cGang of 14\u201d \u2013 Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona, and Olympia Snowe of Maine \u2013 all voted against allowing Halligan\u2019s name to come to a final vote. Democrats had defended Halligan as a \u201csuperbly qualified nominee,\u201d in the words of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee chairman. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, called her a \u201cmoderate\u201d and said Republicans have distorted her record. Schumer said the decision by Republicans to filibuster Halligan means the 2005 Senate agreement, hammered out then by the Gang of 14, would be \u201cnull and void.\u201d He said it could lead to \u201cchaos\u201d as the Senate deals with judicial confirmations in the future, particularly those on the circuit court level. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is facing a tough re-election fight this year, had voted present instead of yes or no. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, was the only senator to cross party lines when she voted in favor of moving the nomination forward. Also nominated for the DC Circuit is Sri Srinivasan, the principal deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department, who has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court. He would be the appeals court\u2019s first Asian-American, if confirmed. The president has also criticized Republicans for blocking nearly two dozen other nominees to the federal bench, half of whom would fill seats that have been labeled \u201cjudicial emergencies\u201d because of rising caseloads and shortages of judges to handle them. Halligan represented the second Republican-led filibuster of an Obama judicial nominee. Former law professor Goodwin Liu was blocked a year ago from serving on the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. He was later named to the California Supreme Court. She is a former New York solicitor general, and had served as a law clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer. Republicans had been criticized for delaying floor votes on many nominees in the president\u2019s first three years in office, but the White House, too, has come under fire for not moving quickly to fill growing bench vacancies. The president\u2019s two Supreme Court choices \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 received relatively swift consideration. Some moderates from both parties have long lamented threats of delays and filibuster attempts of most presidential appointments. They say ongoing unfilled vacancies have created a crisis in many federal courts, with bulging dockets being handled by too few judges.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: As President Barack Obama and GOP candidate Mitt Romney court the Latino vote, CNN takes an in-depth look at this complex and diverse community, what matters most to Latino voters, and how their vote will influence the November elections. Beyond Marco Rubio, other Latinos could be Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick Govs. Susanna Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada are possibilities Republican presidential candidates have historically had bad luck courting Latinos At the Council on Foreign relations this week, Sen. Marco Rubio talked tough on the international hotspot of the day, Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s time to act now. I don\u2019t want to score political points on this issue, I want to see it resolved,\u201d Rubio told Time Magazine\u2019s Rick Stengel, the event\u2019s moderator. Rubio says he doesn\u2019t want to score political points, but like it or not \u2013 every move he makes these days is viewed through one prism: a potential vice presidential pick for Mitt Romney. For many Republicans, Rubio is prime running mate material \u2013 a fresh-faced, telegenic tea party favorite from Florida, a key battleground state. And he is, of course, Hispanic \u2013 a fast-growing ethnic group in the United States, a group Democrats dominated in presidential elections over the past four decades. The impact of the \u2018Latino vote\u2019 beyond Texas Battle for the Latino vote Should Romney pick a Latino for VP? Rubio awarded 'fancy tequila bottle' Counting on the Latino vote In 2008, only 31% of Latinos voted for Sen. John McCain. Nearly 7 in 10 voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama. The best a GOP presidential candidate has ever done with Hispanics was George W. Bush in 2004, and he got just 44% of the group\u2019s vote. A fair number of Republican strategists say that if Romney were to pick a Latino running mate, it could bridge the huge gap. \u201cRepublicans need about 40% of the Hispanic vote to be competitive nationally,\u201d said GOP strategist Leslie Sanchez. \u201cTo add a candidate who happens to be of Hispanic descent is incredibly important, not only because it shows the party can be inclusive, but open-minded Latino independent voters will really see this is a reason to take a second look at the Republican party.\u201d What Latinos want from candidates? Respect How about Martinez or Sandoval? Two other Hispanic Republicans who are generating VP buzz are New Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. Martinez is a gun-toting conservative and the first Latina governor in U.S. history, but she has actually clashed with fellow Hispanics in New Mexico because she wants to reverse a state law allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses. \u201cGiving licenses to people who are here illegally is wrong and overwhelmingly unpopular,\u201d Martinez has argued. Sandoval is a budget-cutting, government-shrinking Republican, but he favors abortion rights, which could be a drawback as a GOP running mate. And though he\u2019s Latino, he doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. Why older Latinos matter in election Alberto Gonzales, the first Latino U.S. attorney general, says a Hispanic at the top of the ticket may help lure Latino voters, but not a No.2. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would make that much of a difference,\u201d Gonzales told CNN. Alberto Gonzales: Economic policies will discourage Hispanics, not voter ID laws Experience is key, Gonzales said. Rubio, Martinez and Sandoval all were elected to their posts a little more than 18 months ago. \u201cI think Governor Romney is better suited looking for someone to join him on the ticket who could be president on Day One,\u201d Gonzales said. Still, a Romney source points out to CNN that some states may be so close on Election Day that a Latino running mate could make the difference. It\u2019s not just states with well-known Latino populations like New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada that matter. Battleground states such as North Carolina and Virginia, where the Latino populations doubled in the past 10 years, could decide the next president. One enormous challenge in picking a Latino running mate is that Hispanic-Americans are very diverse. Rubio is Cuban-American. Martinez is Mexican-American. In the Latino community \u2013 each poses risks for potential culture clashes. Two-thirds of Hispanics in the United States are of Mexican descent, and a much smaller percentage, about 4%, are Cuban. \u201cIt\u2019s very different. It\u2019s coming from different countries, different languages. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be monolithic or vote together,\u201d said Sanchez, the GOP strategist. Some Latino politicians and strategists argue that Hispanics are a natural constituency for the GOP \u2013 not the Democratic party. Many Latino voters tend to be fiscally and socially conservative, they say. \u2018Sleeping giant\u2019 Latino vote yet to awaken The need for outreachSanchez, like other Republican strategists, said the source of the decades-old GOP problem among Hispanic voters is that the party historically did little to no outreach. That has changed in recent years, but the fight has hampered efforts over immigration reform, which many Hispanic voters perceive as anti-Latino. Romney\u2019s stance on illegal immigration during the GOP primary battle turned particularly strident, which Republican Latino strategists worry won\u2019t exactly pull voters to the GOP. While GOP Hispanics such as Gonzales and Sanchez disagree over whether a Latino running mate would really help Romney with Latino voters, they do agree it would be, when it comes to inclusiveness, an extremely important gesture. And it may help Republicans with Latinos in the long run. \u201cIf Governor Romney makes a decision that one of the people you mentioned should be with him on the ticket, and if Governor Romney were to win in November, I mean there would be a great deal of pride in the Hispanic community in having that person being in that position,\u201d said Gonzales.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama says voters will have a clear choice in November A new CNN/ORC poll shows Obama and Mitt Romney statistically even Romney leads Republican attacks on Obama policies after the jobs report The president visits Minneapolis and Chicago for a jobs event and six fundraisers President Barack Obama hit the road for campaigning and fundraisers Friday, arguably the worst day so far in his re-election bid due to a disappointing employment report that brought sharp Republican attacks led by certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Speaking late in the day at a Chicago fundraiser, the president said voters will have a clear choice this November. \u201cThe choice in this election is going to be between a vision that didn\u2019t work during 2000 and 2008 \u2013 didn\u2019t work right before the Great Depression. \u2026 We\u2019ve seen this philosophy before, but the good thing is usually we come to our senses. We realize, you know what, that\u2019s not the way or how democracy is built \u2013 that\u2019s not how our country\u2019s built,\u201d Obama said. He called for comprehensive immigration reform and highlighted his administration\u2019s record on spending. About the GOP strategy to win, Obama said: \u201cThey think they can surf folks\u2019 frustrations all the way to the White House. We\u2019ve seen this game before. We\u2019ve just never seen this much money behind the game.\u201d Earlier in the day during a visit to a Honeywell International plant in suburban Minneapolis, Obama announced new efforts to help war veterans find work back home using the skills they learned in the military. He also urged Congress to establish a Veterans Jobs Corps modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps of decades past. However, the employment report Friday that showed lower-than-expected growth of 69,000 jobs last month and a rise in the unemployment rate to 8.2% provided Romney and Republicans an opening to ratchet up their incessant criticism of Obama\u2019s economic policies. \u201cIt is now clear to everyone that President Obama\u2019s policies have failed to achieve their goals and that the Obama economy is crushing America\u2019s middle class,\u201d Romney said in a statement. He described the new numbers as \u201cdevastating news for American workers,\u201d adding that Obama\u2019s \u201cre-election slogan may be \u2018forward,\u2019 but it seems like we\u2019ve been moving backward. We can do so much better in America.\u201d Piling on was House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who released a statement saying Obama\u2019s \u201cfailed policies have made high unemployment and a weak economy the sad new normal for families and small businesses.\u201d Obama mentioned the jobs report in his remarks to Honeywell workers, saying that the nation continues to fight its way back from the severe recession his administration inherited. \u201cThe economy is growing again but it is not growing as fast as we want it to grow,\u201d Obama said, noting more than 4 million new jobs have been created over the past 27 months. \u201cBut as we learned in today\u2019s jobs report, we are still not creating them as fast as we want.\u201d He noted that events abroad that the United States can\u2019t control, such as Middle East disturbances or European economic  woes, contribute to economic \u201cheadwinds\u201d at home. That means Americans, and especially Congress, must do everything possible to promote economic growth, Obama said. With polls showing the economy as the most important issue by far to voters, the jobs report was bad news for Obama\u2019s re-election campaign on a day when the president was scheduled to attend six fundraisers \u2013 three in Minnesota and three in his hometown of Chicago. A new CNN/ORC International poll released Friday showed Obama and Romney statistically tied among likely voters, but also indicated Obama supporters are more energized at this point than people backing Romney. According to the survey,  49% of registered voters say that if the election were held today, they would vote for Obama, while 46% say they would back Romney. The difference is within the survey\u2019s sampling error. The candidates also are tied \u2013 at 45% each \u2013 when respondents were asked who better understands how the economy works, according to the poll results. However, more than 60% of Obama voters say they strongly support the president, compared to 47% of Romney voters who feel that way about their candidate. So far, the presidential race has focused on Republican claims that Obama\u2019s policies have failed the country, and Democratic assertions that Romney and Republicans seek the same \u201ctrickle down\u201d policies favoring the wealthy at the expense of the middle class that led to the last recession. In particular, the Obama campaign has targeted Romney\u2019s experience in private equity, calling it successful capitalism but not the right background for government leadership. On Thursday, Obama\u2019s campaign also criticized Romney\u2019s record as governor of Massachusetts, with state officials enlisted to tell how Romney promised economic growth but failed to deliver. Republicans complain that Obama and Democrats are attacking Romney because they can\u2019t run on the president\u2019s record. However, a group that analyzes campaign spending reported Friday that 70% of ads run by Democrats in the first six weeks of the presidential campaign were positive in nature, while 73% of commercials run by Republicans were negative. Data provided in a weekly note to their clients by Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political ad spending, showed that overall, 51% of broadcast TV spots in the race for the White House have been positive, while 49% have been negative. The figures apply to the period from April 10 through May 24. April 10 is the day former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania suspended his presidential campaign, which made Romney the presumptive GOP nominee. At the Honeywell plant Friday, Obama announced an executive order intended to make it easier for companies to hire returning service members who can prove they have learned needed skills while in the military. In addition, a new task force will find ways to help veterans get certified at home for such skills, Obama said, adding that veterans shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cprove themselves over and over again.\u201d He also pushed for Congress to establish a jobs program for veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars originally announced earlier this year. The unemployment rate for veterans is 9.2%, a full percentage point higher than the overall unemployment rate. The Veterans Jobs Corps is designed to put veterans to work building infrastructure such as roads and bridges, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. Another part of the plan would provide additional money to communities across the country to hire veterans as police and firefighters. However, the price tag of up to $5 billion has been a stumbling block in Congress, because of a deep political divide over any new spending that is now exacerbated by election year politics. At the six fundraisers later Friday, Obama\u2019s campaign could bring in more than $6.5 million, according to campaign officials. Proceeds from the events will go to the Obama Victory Fund, a joint fund-raising committee of Obama for America, the Democratic National Committee and several state Democratic parties. At least Obama may get a good night\u2019s rest. White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama would spend a night at his Chicago home for the first time in months, and was looking forward to it, including the possibility of making his own breakfast in the morning. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back home. I\u2019m sleeping in my bed tonight. I\u2019m going to go to my kitchen and cook something. Putter around in the backyard a little bit. It\u2019s good being home. The White House is nice, but I\u2019m just leasing,\u201d Obama said in Chicago.

Latinos are the fastest-growing U.S. voter bloc But 2012 turnout could be less than expected due to reduced voter registration, engagement The foreclosure crisis may also have an impact on Latino voting The first Latino president of the United States already has been born. Henry Cisneros, the former San Antonio mayor who was secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration, made the suggestion three years ago in an interview with the Spanish-language news service EFE. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he or she\u2019s in elementary school or in law school or is already elected \u2026 to public office, but I believe that that person is already alive, and we\u2019re 20 years or less away from having a Latino or Latina president,\u201d said Cisneros, whose own path to higher office may have been derailed by personal scandal and who today is executive chairman of CityView, an urban development investment firm. When the day comes that Cisneros predicted, the man or woman behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office will represent an ever-increasing segment of the population. Latinos (or Hispanics, the official government term) made up 15.5% of the U.S. population in 2010, but by 2050 they\u2019re projected to approach 25% of the population. The American, the online magazine of the American Enterprise Institute, calls the Hispanic electorate a \u201csleeping giant\u201d yet to wake. Latino vote may decide 2012 election Fight for the Latino vote in 2012 Latinos divided on same-sex marriage issue Rubio on winning Florida's Hispanic voters Whether or not Latinos\u2019 percentage in the electorate has kept pace with their growth in the population \u2013 and the data indicates that at present it has not \u2013 it may one day be enough to sway elections from the statehouse to the White House and stops in between. Not one \u2018Latino vote\u2019 Conventional wisdom lumps together \u201cthe Latino vote.\u201d But that community includes millions of people claiming dozens of countries of origin, speaking more than just Spanish. It is not now \u2013 nor in the future \u2013 likely to be anything so homogenous. Juan Guillermo Tornoe, owner of Hispanic Trending Inc., a marketing and advertising firm in Austin, Texas, and author of the Hispanic Trending blog, is \u201ccounting the days\u201d until he is eligible to become a U.S. citizen in a couple of years and vote in a presidential election. For several years, Tornoe, a Guatemala native who came to the United States 10 years ago and now has permanent resident status, has talked about the nuances of the Latino community, the kinds of things companies marketing products (and political parties marketing candidates) need to know. \u201cThere is not one Latino Vote; there is a multitude of Latino votes and candidates, society, and the media need to fully understand this if they are ever going to connect with the different parts of the Hispanic community,\u201d he advised. Tornoe cringes \u201cevery time someone refers to Latinos as a unified voting bloc or as a homogeneous market segment. We are way too diverse for this.\u201d \u201cThere are many differences between Hispanics, depending upon the person\u2019s country of origin or heritage: Food and music preferences as well as the holidays they celebrate are some of the most obvious,\u201d Tornoe says. \u201cThe actual words they use to describe persons, places, actions and things can vary immensely as well. There is also a lot of ideological baggage that comes along with one\u2019s country of origin/heritage.\u201d Black beans vs. kidney beans To illustrate the matter of food preferences, Frank Unanue Jr., an executive with one of the nation\u2019s largest Hispanic food companies, notes the differences within the ethnic population in his state of Florida: Black beans and rice are big with the Cuban community in Miami, \u201cBut up north, we sell more kidney beans, rice, fruit nectars and fruit juices. They all move well,\u201d said Unanue, president of Goya Foods Florida. Gabriel Sanchez, an associate professor of political science at the University of New Mexico and research director for the group Latino Decisions, explains self-identification: \u201cIn short, although more Latinos prefer to use national origin to identify themselves, Latino pan-ethnic identity is highly relevant to the political behavior of the Latino population and will only increase in salience as long as the political debates surrounding immigration policy is perceived to be hostile to the Latino community among the Hispanic population.\u201d As for generational differences, Tornoe said: \u201cIt is a completely different worldview depending how far away generationally Hispanics are from their country of origin/heritage. \u201cFirst-generation (foreign-born) Latinos have experienced life outside the U.S., have gone through the immigration experience, and to different degrees, have embraced or become acquainted with living in America. Second-generation Latinos encounter a mixed experience, being born and growing up in the United States, but brought up by immigrants and thus heavily exposed and influenced by their parents\u2019 culture. \u201cFinally, Latinos who are third generation and beyond are the sons and daughters of U.S.-born parents. They are very much influenced by the general market but still connect to their roots through the values, traditions and culture passed on by their parents and grandparents.\u201d When it comes to citizenship, Tornoe, who hopes to be officially an American in three years, is clear. \u201cBeing a U.S.-born citizen puts you in a completely different frame of mind than that of a naturalized U.S. citizen, someone who\u2019s a permanent resident (who could be counting the days to becoming a citizen or simply choosing to never become one), someone here on a temporary work visa or an undocumented alien,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these are part of the Latino population, but only a percentage of them are able to vote. \u201cThen, among the latter, it is not the same to be able to vote, than to be a registered voter and actually cast your vote. Lack of participation in the democratic process is one of the major problems among the Hispanic community.\u201d Population does not equal electoral influence \u2013 not yet anyway. As a Houston Chronicle headline noted in April \u2013 \u201cIdea of Hispanic voter surge fading this year\u201d \u2013 Hispanic voter registration and turnout might fall below estimates. Still, the fast-growing population should not be completely dismissed. An article from the AEI\u2019s The American looked at the lag between population and turnout. \u201cHispanics have been the \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 of American politics for decades. Each election season, we see more and more articles about how important this group of Americans is, and how their impact will be outsized and ever-growing. Yet for some reason, the \u2018giant\u2019 never quite seems to wake up.\u201d There are an estimated 31.8 million Hispanics of voting age (18 and older) in the United States, but only 10.9 million \u2013 51.6% \u2013 are registered to vote, compared with 62.8% for eligible African-Americans and 68.2% for what the government calls non-Hispanic whites, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Voters not re-registering \u201cWe believe that the recession and mortgage foreclosure crisis explains this decline,\u201d Antonio Gonzalez, director of the William C. Velasquez Institute, based in San Antonio, told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cIt hit blacks and Latinos and the lower middle-class people first. \u201cWhen people lose their jobs or homes, they usually have to move elsewhere. When you move, you have to re-register, and we suspect that didn\u2019t happen in 2009-10. \u2026  The law of unintended consequences is at work here. This administration, like the last one, didn\u2019t have an answer for home foreclosures. The unintended consequence is a dampening of Latino voter turnout.\u201d Academic experts and advocates agree that increasing registration is the key to taking advantage of the opportunities available to influence the outcome of the 2012 election, perhaps more on Capitol Hill than at the White House. Gonzalez, who also heads the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, said that while just 15% of the Latino vote is in so-called battleground states for the presidential race, this year offers numerous opportunities for Latinos to increase their ranks on Capitol Hill. At the top of Gonzalez\u2019 list was the newly created 33rd Congressional District, near Dallas, a seat reflecting the rise in Texas\u2019 population, an increase due in large part to the state\u2019s growing Latino population. The Houston Chronicle noted that while the Hispanic population in Texas grew by 2.8 million in the past decade, the number of registered Hispanic voters declined by 100,000 between 2008-2010. The 33rd District reflects the changing demographics of the Dallas area, Gonzalez said. \u201cBig D\u201d is becoming more Latino, and the population in the 33rd is nearly two-thirds Latino. The University of Washington\u2019s Matt Barreto calls the problem a \u201cregistration deficit,\u201d pointing to such states as North Carolina and Virginia, where the shortfall threatens or, at least, delays Latino impact from reaching its potential. Barreto, also the co-founder of the research firm Latino Decisions, estimates that 70% of Latino voters back President Barack Obama despite disappointment over the failure to see immigration reform legislation enacted. But again, he said, the issue is turnout, which begins with registration. As for immigration, which conventional wisdom often sees as the issue of greatest importance to Latinos, Barreto said that it falls behind the economy and jobs, not to mention education and health care, for most Latinos. In the end, the issue comes down to what can be done to increase Latino registration and voter turnout. Gustavo Razzetti, chief strategy and engagement officer at Grupo Gallegos, based in Los Angeles, said that fear and apathy may be dampening turnout. \u201cThe most obvious answer is lack of information,\u201d said Razzetti, who has more than 20 years\u2019 experience in U.S. and Latin American markets. \u201cNot understanding how the system works and the fear to take time off of work appear on top of the list. Yet when reviewing other reasons (legal residents who haven\u2019t become U.S. citizens or feel that their votes don\u2019t count), it seems that one of the most important factors is that Latinos don\u2019t care. And I\u2019m not saying it in a negative way; it\u2019s simply that if they don\u2019t believe that their vote will impact their everyday life, why care to vote or to get the citizenship?\u201d Razzetti offers this advice: \u201cCandidates and parties need to make a strong effort to engage Latinos. They need to understand that educating Latinos is important but only the first step.\u201d Razzetti suggested such unlikely ideas as \u201cvoto trucks,\u201d modeled after food trucks, or \u201cvoting empanada/tamale stands outside markets\u201d or working voting into the plots of Spanish-language telenovelas to spur interest, registration and, ultimately, voting. \u201cThere\u2019s room for a true leader who can inspire Latinos to take a more active civic role as well as community support. Political participation needs to be encouraged at home, school and in the community in general,\u201d he said. \u201cFamily and friends play a critical role in encouraging other family and friends to vote. Organizations need to consider this as part of their outreach strategy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst fails to get 50% of primary vote That forces a runoff with tea party favorite Ted Cruz SEC reports put spending in the hotly contended race at $31.6 million A boiling primary battle in Texas headed to a runoff early Wednesday as two Republicans running for U.S. Senate failed to reach the 50% threshold to clinch the GOP nomination. Though Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst led the crowded field of candidates, he narrowly failed to cross the 50% mark required to secure the nomination and avoid a July 31 runoff. Dewhurst\u2019s challenger in the runoff will be tea party favorite Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general with strong support from national groups and high-profile conservative leaders. With 99.6% of precincts counted, Dewhurst held 48% of the vote to 30% for Cruz. Other contenders in Tuesday\u2019s primary included former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert and ESPN Broadcaster Craig James. Neither candidate will forge ahead to compete in the runoff. The Texas race is particularly important because the balance of power in the U.S. Senate could shift in 2012. It is also another test in the staying power and influence of tea party groups and their political strategy to focus more on congressional races than on the presidential campaign. The race, held to replace retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, has seen a Texas-sized level of spending, as well. According to Federal Election Commission reports, more than $31.6 million had been dumped in the GOP primary as of May 9, with more than half coming from Dewhurst\u2019s team. While Cruz\u2019s campaign has spent more than $4 million, the underdog has been boosted by a surge of outside spending. The fiscal conservative organization Club for Growth has spent more than $2 million, and the tea party oriented FreedomWorks has also been heavy on the ground in get-out-the-vote efforts on behalf of Cruz. Members of the Tea Party Express, a leading arm of the grass-roots movement, have traversed the state by bus in support of Cruz. Adding to his rising star power, the former solicitor general landed endorsements from former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum and tea party stalwart Sarah Palin, two big voices in the conservative movement. Dewhurst, meanwhile, touts his support from 2008 presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has also been vocal for his No. 2. In a recent commercial, Perry urged voters to turn out for Dewhurst, insisting he was the true conservative in the race. Given that Perry and Dewhurst have worked together for almost a decade, some political observers characterize the race as a possible referendum on Perry, the state\u2019s longest-serving governor in history. But Perry brushed off the idea on Friday, telling CNN Chief National Correspondent John King that while national conservatives may be making noise in the race against Dewhurst, the local movement will stand for the lieutenant governor. \u201cThere\u2019s, you know, people who come from out of state and make their endorsements known,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut Texas conservatives are lining up behind David Dewhurst.\u201d Dewhurst opponents criticize the candidate as being part of the Republican establishment and having too many years in government under his belt. Before becoming lieutenant governor, Dewhurst served as Texas Land Commissioner in the late \u201990s. Hitting back, Dewhurst points to his private sector experience as the co-founder of Falcon Seaboard, an energy company based in Houston. He also boasts his role in pushing for socially conservative legislation in the state, including a recent bill that requires women to see a sonogram and go through a 24-hour waiting period before having an abortion. Dewhurst has attacked Cruz, who is of Cuban descent, as a supporter of amnesty and a member of the Hispanic Leadership Fund and the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute. Cruz has also been on the defense over criticism that he works for a firm representing a Chinese company being sued for patent violations. The candidate has repeatedly shot down both claims, arguing he has long been an opponent of illegal immigration and saying he is not the lead lawyer in the patent lawsuit. The Hispanic Leadership Fund also fired back against Dewhurst\u2019s latest ad, saying Cruz has never had any position with the group and faulted the ad as dishonest. \u201cThe Hispanic Leadership Fund support using free market and limited government principles to strengthen border security, restore a functional legal immigration system, and promote patriotic assimilation. If David Dewhurst wants to deceitfully lump us in with leftist organizations that actually do promote amnesty, then all he is accomplishing is demonstrating to Texas voters how intellectually shallow he is,\u201d Mario H. Lopez, the organization\u2019s president, said in a statement. On the Democratic side, former state Rep. Paul Sadler and political operative Sean Hubbard are competing for their party\u2019s nomination. Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in more than two decades. Political handicappers Stuart Rothenberg and Charlie Cook both rate the open seat as safe for Republicans.",

            "article_content": "Births of nonwhites have now overtaken births of whites, according to the U.S. Census Republicans face uphill battle in persuading Latinos to vote for their candidates Shift is most pronounced in the South and Southwest When presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney appears before Latino small-business owners in Washington on Wednesday, he\u2019ll address a group whose explosive birth rates foreshadow a seismic political shift in GOP strongholds in the Deep South and Southwest. \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 problem is their voters are white, aging and dying off,\u201d said David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, who studies minority political engagement. \u201cThere will come a time when they suffer catastrophic losses with the realization of the population changes.\u201d Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters \u2013 who, according to U.S. Census figures released this week, now represent more than half of the nation\u2019s population born in the past year \u2013 will become more of a power base in places like Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend across the Southwest all the way to California, experts say. Opinion: Sorry Rush Limbaugh, minorities not looking for \u2018payback\u2019 The coming political revolution could result in a massive changing of the guard on nearly every level of government, potential cultural clashes, and the type of political alliances that are now considered rare. Offspring of immigrant farm workers In Georgia, those rumblings are already being felt. It is a state that depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick peaches and peanuts and work in poultry plants. So when Georgia \u2013 like its Southern sister states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina \u2013 passed a tough anti-immigration bill that also penalizes businesses, Hispanic groups and farmers alike pushed back. Romney's record on immigration Axelrod on Romney's business record Does Romney want it both ways for jobs? Booker backs off Obama criticism \u201cThis election cycle Latinos in Georgia are upset about (the law),\u201d said Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of GALEO, a nonprofit and nonpartisan group geared toward Georgia\u2019s growing Latino population. \u201cThat\u2019s going to spur more galvanization than we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d According to the Pew Hispanic Center, Southeastern states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee boast some of the greatest percentage increases in Latino population growth. They are also states where the percentage of Hispanics roughly doubled. And, according to Pew, the Latino population boom helped Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Washington net additional congressional seats. Though Georgia\u2019s Latino population has mushroomed over the past ten years, according to Pew, roughly 23% of that group is eligible to vote, compared to roughly 76.2% of whites and just over 69% of African-Americans. Still, activists like Gonzalez are hopeful that lawmakers will see the trends and recognize \u201cLatinos merit a seat at the table as well.\u201d Follow us on Twitter @CNNPolitics\nJoin us on \n            \n                Facebook/CNNPolitics So far, Republican efforts to offer Latinos a place at the table have fallen short. The nation\u2019s Hispanics tend to vote Democratic, and overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008. Romney in particular has stumbled with this critical voting bloc, after his comments suggesting that making the economic landscape tough for illegal immigrants will force them to \u201cself deport.\u201d Trying to convince a growing population Even Republican Hispanic lawmakers, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, have urged the GOP to soften its language when discussing immigration and such proposals as the House-passed version of the Violence Against Women Act, which killed expanded coverage for illegal immigrants and Native Americans who are victims of domestic abuse, and the failed DREAM Act, which would have given U.S. residency to immigrant kids with high school diplomas. The GOP is trying to clean up its image with Hispanic voters, with an eye toward the demographic\u2019s looming political clout. Romney is slated to speak at the Latino Coalition\u2019s Annual Economic Summit in Washington on Wednesday. Last week, his campaign released \u201cDia Uno,\u201d a Spanish-language version of an ad underscoring Romney\u2019s mission for the first day he assumes the presidency. If Republicans continue to struggle to appeal to Latino voters, Spanish-language ads may not stave off a change that experts like Bositis see coming in the not too distant future, when states such as Georgia go purple and eventually blue. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a tipping point where you\u2019ve got the Republicans in charge, but you\u2019ll get to the point when the population becomes minority,\u201d Bositis said. \u201cWhen that happens the statewide offices will fall. Republican governors will fall. Things will change.\u201d This announcement on birth rates \u201cshould be a wake-up call to everyone running for political office from this day forward,\u201d said Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980. \u201cLatinos should no longer be considered minorities. In many crucial electoral states, this \u2018former minority\u2019 is fast becoming the deciding vote. The candidate who reaches out most effectively will win their support.\u201d \u201cToken efforts, such as tamale parties, will no longer work. Winning will require more than outreach. It will require inclusion,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cLatinos, African-Americans and people of other races must be represented in the important decision-making strategies of any given campaign, whether it be for a Democrat or Republican.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lugar delivers a statement that is part defense and part warning Mourdock's stand-your-ground approach is not conducive to problem-solving, Lugar says He says he stands by his votes \"without regrets\" As soon as 36-year Senate veteran Richard Lugar finished his concession speech Tuesday, he walked off the stage, out the back door and into his car. But he left behind something unusual and \u2013 in the annals of politics \u2013 somewhat extraordinary. Lugar had his aides distribute a prepared statement that was part detailed defense of his ill-fated and often maligned campaign strategy, and part stark warning to both parties about the divisive state of American politics \u2013 starting with Richard Mourdock, the Republican who beat him. \u201cHis embrace of an unrelenting partisan mindset is irreconcilable with my philosophy of governance and my experience of what brings results for Hoosiers in the Senate.  In effect, what he has promised in this campaign is reflexive votes for a rejectionist orthodoxy and rigid opposition to the actions and proposals of the other party,\u201d Lugar wrote of Mourdock, Read Lugar\u2019s statement Mourdock appealed to Republican voters by arguing Lugar\u2019s tolerance for compromise should be replaced by stand-your-ground confrontation. Mourdock won't compromise principles Lugar: My service isn't concluded Dick Lugar reflects on his Senate career \u201cHe has pledged his support to groups whose prime mission is to cleanse the Republican party of those who stray from orthodoxy as they see it,\u201d said Lugar of the GOP opponent who beat him. \u201cThis is not conducive to problem solving and governance.  And he will find that unless he modifies his approach, he will achieve little as a legislator.  Worse, he will help delay solutions that are totally beyond the capacity of partisan majorities to achieve,\u201d said Lugar. Lugar, a senior Republican statesman who briefed President Dwight Eisenhower as a young naval officer, offered a shot across the bow to today\u2019s GOP. He said if Republicans continue to make it difficult for legislators to find compromise, \u201cwe will be relegated to minority status.  Parties don\u2019t succeed for long if they stop appealing to voters who may disagree with them on some issues.\u201d And he didn\u2019t stop there. His stinging words about today\u2019s divisive politics were reminiscent of moderate Republican Senator Olympia Snowe\u2019s open disgust for what the process has become when she announced she was retiring. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when so many topics have become politically unmentionable in one party or the other.   Republicans cannot admit to any nuance in policy on climate change.  Republican members are now expected to take pledges against any tax increases.  For two consecutive presidential nomination cycles, GOP candidates competed with one another to express the most strident anti-immigration view, even at the risk of alienating a huge voting bloc,\u201d said Lugar. The six-term Republican was hammered by Mourdock and outside groups for voting for President Obama\u2019s two Supreme Court picks and supporting other parts of the president\u2019s agenda from immigration to energy. Lugar cast some votes and took positions - like defending earmarks - that he knew would be unpopular with the GOP base and could even lead to a primary defeat. Many Republican strategists \u2013 including close allies and longtime supporters \u2013 were perplexed that he didn\u2019t tack right and alter his rhetoric in order to better position himself. In his unusual departing treatise, Lugar said he believes his votes for Wall Street and auto industry bailouts, and immigration reforms were \u201cthe right votes for the country.\u201d \u201cI stand by them without regrets,\u201d said Lugar. \u201cIdeology cannot be a substitute for a determination to think for yourself, for a willingness to study an issue objectively, and for the fortitude to sometimes disagree with your party or even your constituents,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a Lugar supporter who avoided his own Senate primary defeat two years ago with scorched earth strategy against his opponent, told CNN he believes a lesson from a Lugar loss is not to play defense. McCain was saying out loud what many GOP strategists had said in private: that Lugar allowed opponents to define him and did not adequately prepare a re-election campaign in today\u2019s anti-incumbent environment. Lugar tried to dispel that. \u201cThe truth is that the headwinds in this race were abundantly apparent long before Richard Mourdock announced his candidacy.  One does not highlight such headwinds publicly when one is waging a campaign.  But I knew that I would face an extremely strong anti-incumbent mood following a recession,\u201d said Lugar. To people who whispered loudly that Lugar simply didn\u2019t work hard enough to get back to Indiana and prove he hasn\u2019t lost touch, he insisted that \u201cthere never was a moment when my campaign took anything for granted.\u201d With so many of Lugar\u2019s moderate colleagues in both parties deciding to call it quits this year rather than face bruising re-election campaigns, it has been perplexing why the octogenarian didn\u2019t choose to cap off a stellar career by retiring on his own terms. He had a carefully-crafted answer for that too, saying his goals on domestic and foreign policy \u201cwould benefit from my continued service as a Senator.\u201d \u201cThese goals were worth the risk of an electoral defeat and the costs of a hard campaign,\u201d he said. In the end, Lugar did this the way he wanted \u2013 the way so many of his former aides and supporters say he has always done things: his way. Not always politically expedient or strategically smart, but, from his perspective, principled.",

            "article_content": "A second term would allow Obama to push forward with agenda Biden's same-sex marriage comments fueled speculation about Obama's view Republicans think Obama would push tax increases in second term New regulations are a target of GOP if they prevent second Obama term A gaffe is when a politician is caught telling the truth, the old saying goes. So it was in March when a hot microphone picked up President Barack Obama telling his Russian counterpart, Dmitri Medvedev, that he will have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d if he wins re-election in November. The president\u2019s top aides scrambled to downplay the remark, assuring reporters Obama doesn\u2019t have any surprises up his sleeve should voters hand him a second term.  But underlying the president\u2019s comment is a truism of American politics: Without the specter of a looming election, a second-term president is liberated to pursue policies that aren\u2019t politically tenable at the ballot box. What\u2019s more, an Obama win in November would provide an opportunity for the president to claim a mandate to press forward full-throttle with policies Republicans have spent the last two years deriding. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to pick up everything he didn\u2019t get the first term and he will certainly try to use whatever mandate he has going forward,\u201d said Jennifer Rubin, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post. Moreover, an Obama win would be a stinging defeat for Republicans who currently view the president as extremely vulnerable. The result may be a rethinking among GOP ranks on Capitol Hill about how to proceed. \u201cRepublicans will be under a huge amount of pressure to be conciliatory,\u201d said Rubin. The last two presidents are instructive: Upon winning re-election narrowly in 2004, President Bush declared that he had \u201cearned political capital.\u201d  He spent the following months attempting to shepherd through an unpopular overhaul of Social Security, a measure so unpalatable that members of his own party forced him to drop it. Obama's view on same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage front and center Biden 'comfortable' with gay marriage After his easy re-election in 1996, Bill Clinton immediately proposed a massively priced children\u2019s health insurance bill and a significant increase in education spending (he got both). So when Vice President Joe Biden said over the weekend that he supports same-sex marriage \u2013 a position the president has inched steadily toward but not yet backed full-bore \u2013 conservatives and political observers alike took it as a sure sign Obama himself will embrace the issue if his next four years are secured. \u201cIf you ask me, his position is a lot like what he said to Medvedev at the open mic in Europe,\u201d said former New York Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday. \u201cI think the American people deserve to know today where President Obama stands today and where he will stand next year on this issue.\u201d So what else do Republicans think may result from an unbridled Obama? Many Republicans CNN spoke with pointed to taxes first.  The president himself has made no secret he wants to raise taxes on American households making more than $250,000 a year.  But some Republicans fear that\u2019s just the beginning. \u201cEventually the structural budget and deficit will have to get addressed, and his solution is likely to be a tax increase on the middle class,\u201d Rubin said. The White House maintains Obama wants to overhaul the tax code, keeping rates steady for middle- and lower-income Americans while closing corporate loopholes and instituting a minimum tax on those making more than $1 million.  But Obama has offered few details on the dazzlingly complex undertaking. \u201cThere is uncertainty around the president\u2019s tax policy that scares fiscal conservatives\u201d said Margaret Hoover, a conservative commentator who worked in the Bush White House. \u201cHe has to deal with taxes right away and he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to do it,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a former aide to House Minority Leader Eric Cantor. Republicans also predict a massive increase in spending should the president get a second term, starting with health care. Many of the law\u2019s reforms don\u2019t kick in until 2013, promising a hefty price next year if the measure isn\u2019t modified. \u201cRight now there are just budget gimmicks to pay for it,\u201d said Dayspring, \u201cHe has to figure out how to pay for it.  And he\u2019s shown no will to reform entitlements.\u201d \u201cThere is a sincere fear that our economy will collapse if Obama stays in office because of spending and entitlements,\u201d added Matt Lewis, a conservative blogger for The Daily Caller. Uncertainty over business regulations is also causing unease.  Republicans argue one of the reasons the recovery has been so sluggish is the uncertainty around increased regulations.  Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has vowed to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, the Wall Street reform measure signed into law by Obama in 2010.  Particularly irksome is that the bill bestowed considerable power to rule-making agencies, like the newly established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Should Obama win, he\u2019s likely to leave the act untouched. \u201cRepublicans worry that not amending certain provisions of Dodd-Frank will stall the recovery,\u201d Hoover said. On the foreign policy front, critics say Obama could go soft on missile defense in Europe and allow Iran to strengthen its stature. \u201cIran and Russia will continue to be emboldened,\u201d said Hoover. Of course, these doomsday scenarios are to be expected in election year politics and the president himself makes similarly unsettling predictions about what a Romney presidency would bring.  Meanwhile, White House aides say climate change, energy reform and an immigration overhaul are on the top of the president\u2019s list for term No. 2. But one issue in particular has some conservatives especially wary: the Supreme Court.  With three justices well into their 70s, it\u2019s likely there will be at least one retirement in the next four years on the high court, possibly from the conservative bloc. \u201cThis is what many Republican thought-leaders are most concerned about,\u201d said Lewis.  \u201cThey have lifetime appointments.  It\u2019s the most powerful way Obama can leave his mark.\u201d",

He was the Senate GOP\u2019s most prominent supporter of a new arms control treaty with Russia, America\u2019s \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe,\u201d according to Mitt Romney. Lugar was once called Obama\u2019s favorite Republican senator, a fact Mourdock\u2019s campaign repeated endlessly. With friends like that, conservatives asked, who needs enemies? \u201cIt all adds up,\u201d said GOP pollster John McLaughlin, who helped Lugar in the past but is working for Mourdock this time. It \u201cgoes against (Indiana primary voters\u2019) conservative values.\u201d Lugar\u2019s \u201ccampaign was not very nimble or adept at responding to some of the charges against him,\u201d one Indiana Republican operative said. \u201cYou have to react and you have to pivot\u201d when challenged. There was \u201ca failure to remind people what Dick Lugar has done for this state, this country, and this world.\u201d To the end, Lugar kept the support of establishment Republican leaders like Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels and Arizona Sen. John McCain. But insurgent icons like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum flocked to Mourdock\u2019s banner. Perhaps more importantly, outside conservative groups like FreedomWorks and Club for Growth poured pro-Mourdock ad money into the state, obliterating what once would have been considered an insurmountable financial advantage for Lugar. None of that may have happened, however, if Lugar had paid more attention to Indiana Republicans in recent years. Most analysts contacted by CNN reached the same conclusion: Lugar\u2019s defeat is as much a reflection of the political weakness of a globetrotting elder statesman who failed to maintain ties with the folks back home as it is a sign of tea party strength. Mourdock is \u201cthe uber-accessible guy,\u201d the operative noted. \u201cAny (state party) event you go to, there should be a Mourdock name tag printed out because chances are he\u2019s showing up. \u2026 He\u2019s at every chili cook-off imaginable.\u201d The operative noted that Lugar rarely if ever showed up to local Republican Party events in recent years. Not coincidentally, the overwhelming majority of local GOP officials backed Mourdock. There was a feeling among the GOP\u2019s county chairmen that Lugar is \u201ctoo big for us, and he\u2019s too good for us,\u201d Matthews said. In contrast, the operative said, Indiana\u2019s other GOP senator, Dan Coats, assiduously courted grassroots activists and local party leaders when he decided to return to elected office in Indiana after more than a decade working as a diplomat and a Washington lobbyist.  While Coats wasn\u2019t a tea party favorite when he won the GOP nod in 2010, his hard work on the local level helped him beat back a primary challenge from a couple of candidates more strongly favored by conservatives. A number of analysts said Lugar should have followed the lead of Senate colleague Orrin Hatch, who committed significant time and resources to his own renomination fight this year.  Two years ago, Hatch saw fellow Utah Sen. Robert Bennett lose his GOP nomination battle to political newcomer Mike Lee. Bennett, a fairly conservative three-term Senate veteran, failed to see the tea party storm coming in 2010 and paid the price at that year\u2019s Utah GOP convention. After Bennett\u2019s loss, Hatch furiously cultivated the support of local activists.  In April, he won the support of an overwhelming majority of delegates at the state convention.  He is now expected to easily win his primary and roll to victory in the general election. For many Indiana Republicans, a controversy earlier this year over Lugar\u2019s residence crystallized the perception that he had abandoned them.  Lugar, who actually has lived in northern Virginia since the sale of his Indianapolis home in 1977, was forced to beat back a ballot eligibility challenge based on the location of his current home. Lugar successfully argued that Indiana\u2019s constitution only required him to maintain a physical residence in the state during his first campaign.  Politically, however, the damage was done.  At one point, Lugar admitted he wasn\u2019t even sure what address was on his Indiana driver\u2019s license. Indiana politics, the operative noted, has a long history of residency-based ballot access controversies. Coats faced a similar challenge when he returned to the state to run for Senate in 2010. \u201cIn and of itself, I don\u2019t think it would have worked,\u201d the operative said.  But Lugar is \u201ccasting these (controversial) votes because he\u2019s never here and doesn\u2019t hear us.\u201d  The residency issue was more potent this time around \u201cbecause it fits the overall narrative.\u201d The challenge to Lugar\u2019s residency, McLaughlin told CNN, \u201cwas saying he\u2019s really gone to Washington and doesn\u2019t even live here anymore.\u201d  Why, he wondered, didn\u2019t Lugar \u201cjust buy a condo?\u201d Two-thirds of primary voters in Mourdock\u2019s campaign polls said Lugar has been in Washington too long and is out of touch with Hoosier values, McLaughlin added. Mourdock, in contrast, has pledged to serve only two terms in Washington. Mourdock also maintained a \u201crespectful\u201d tone while challenging the veteran senator, McLaughlin added. Mourdock \u201cstood up in (his) one debate (with Lugar) and was credible,\u201d Matthews said.  He may have been the favorite of the most conservative voters, but \u201cnobody could say he\u2019s a whack job.\u201d Now Mourdock is probably going to Washington.  And Lugar, a hero of the Washington establishment, is headed home, wherever that is.",

            "article_content": "NEW: \"We will finish what we started,\" Obama tells backers at a Virginia rally The president began the day with an event in Ohio, kicking off his re-election bid Both Ohio and Virginia are considered crucial battleground states in the election Romney is returning to Ohio on Monday President Barack Obama formally opened his re-election bid Saturday with two rallies in which he highlighted accomplishments over his three and a half years in the White House and argued that America can\u2019t afford to adopt Republicans\u2019 \u201cbad ideas.\u201d \u201cWe are making progress and now we face a choice,\u201d said the president, at his first rally at the Schottenstein Center on the campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus. \u201cThis is a make or break moment for the middle class, and we can\u2019t turn back now.\u201d In this 36-minute-long address, Obama said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would \u201crubber stamp\u201d the congressional GOP agenda, telling the crowd that \u201cwe cannot give him that chance.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the choice in this election, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for a second term as president of the United States,\u201d added Obama. The speech highlighted the narrative that the Obama campaign hopes to push this year: reminding voters how many millions of jobs were lost before the president took office. The president said that in the final six months of 2008, \u201cnearly three million of our neighbors lost their jobs.\u201d But he said when he took office, \u201cWe didn\u2019t quit. We don\u2019t quit. Together we are fighting our way back.\u201d Obama touted the federal government\u2019s rescue of the big auto companies, and he criticized his challenger, saying \u201cwhen some wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt, we didn\u2019t turn our backs.\u201d \u201cToday, America\u2019s auto industry is on top of the world,\u201d he said. The Michigan-born Romney, whose father was a former auto executive and governor of that state, opposed the bailout, saying a structured bankruptcy could have achieved the same result without the massive cost to the U.S. government. Moreover, the former Massachusetts governor has argued the Obama administration made too many concessions to auto unions as part of that bailout. Obama: 'This is a make or break moment' Obama criticizes Romney's tax cut plan Obama: 'We're fighting our way back' Pres. Obama touts military milestones The president also touted his foreign policy achievements, saying that \u201cfor the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.\u201d He said that \u201cOsama bin Laden is no longer a threat to this country,\u201d and \u201cal Qaeda is on the path to defeat.\u201d He then pledged that \u201cby 2014, the war in Afghanistan will be over,\u201d and pointed out that Romney had opposed setting a troop withdrawal deadline in that conflict. On the controversial issue of illegal immigration, Obama declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because they\u2019re the children of undocumented immigrants.\u201d Romney took a hard stance against illegal immigration during the Republican primaries, opposing the president\u2019s push for a limited pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants. The issue is of importance to the growing Latino electorate in the United States. The Ohio arena, which holds around 20,000 people, appeared to be around two-thirds to three-quarters full, with around half of the seating in the upper deck empty. The Columbus fire department estimated the crowd size at 14,000. While smaller in size than many Obama rallies during the 2008 campaign, the crowd dwarfed the size of any rally held this cycle by Romney. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s campaign quickly reacted to the president\u2019s speech. \u201cThe fact remains that American families are struggling on his watch: to pay their bills, find a job and keep their homes. While President Obama all but ignored his record over three and a half years in office, the American people won\u2019t. This November, they will hold him accountable for his broken promises and ineffective leadership,\u201d Romney campaign press secretary Andrea Saul said in a statement. Prior to Saturday\u2019s rally, the president had made 20 trips to Ohio since taking office. Romney returns to Ohio on Monday, his third trip to the Buckeye State in three weeks. Ohio\u2019s unemployment level stands at 7.5%, slightly lower than the national average of 8.1%. Ohio has become a crucial battleground state in recent presidential elections. The Buckeye State put President George W. Bush over the top in his 2004 re-election. Four years ago, Obama won Ohio by five percentage points over Sen. John McCain of Arizona. The most recent public opinion poll in Ohio, released earlier this week by Quinnipiac University, indicated a tie between Obama and Romney. According to the survey, 44% of registered voters supported Obama, with 42% backing Romney. The president\u2019s two-point margin was well with in the poll\u2019s sampling error. Acknowledging that his re-election bid faces hurdles, the president told those in the audience that \u201cOhio, this election will be closer than the last.\u201d And while he continuously talked about moving \u201cforward\u201d \u2013 his 2012 campaign slogan \u2013 in his speech, he did hark back to his 2008 slogan. \u201cIf people ask what this campaign is about, you tell them it\u2019s still about hope, it\u2019s still about change,\u201d said Obama. After the Ohio speech, the president went to Virginia, another crucial battleground state, and held a rally on the Richmond campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. The Rams successful men\u2019s basketball coach Shaka Smart hosted the event at the school\u2019s Stuart C. Siegel Center. A fire marshal said that about 8,000 people were in attendance, filling the arena to capacity according to the Obama campaign. First lady Michele Obama introduced her husband, telling the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far. We\u2019ve got so much more to do.\u201d The president then took the stage, offering a speech much like the one he\u2019d made hours earlier in Ohio. He pointed to the \u201cprogress\u201d made during his first term, and suggested Romney and \u201chis friends\u201d were delusional if they \u201cthink that the same bad ideas will lead to a different result.\u201d Obama ended his speech trying to fire up his supporters to \u201cstick with me, fight with me, and press on with me.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work even harder in this election than in the last election, I guarantee you we will move this country forward,\u201d he told the Richmond crowd. \u201cWe will finish what we started.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney trails Barack Obama among women, Latino voters Romney's team is still working on how to package its candidate Wounds from bitter GOP primary seem to be healing faster than most thought Anger toward Obama appears to motivate Republicans more than their candidate After devoting seven years and tens of millions of dollars trying to convince conservatives that he is one of them, Mitt Romney finally has a firm grip on the Republican presidential nomination. Now comes the hard part. In a matter of weeks, Romney must shift his focus away from the right and hone his message for the mass audience that will vote in November, all while building a campaign organization to challenge Barack Obama\u2019s finely tuned machine. The Romney campaign, long aware that their buttoned-up candidate is better suited for a general election fight than the red meat demands of a GOP primary battle, has been preparing for this moment for years. But thanks to the heated Republican debates over contraception and immigration, Romney begins the race trailing Obama by double-digit margins among female voters and by almost 40 points among Latinos, according to some surveys. Math like that makes it near impossible to win. And in a campaign focused on the economy, Romney will be constantly reminded of the awkward campaign moments \u2013 asides about owning multiple Cadillacs and palling around with NFL owners \u2013 that called attention to his substantial personal fortune. Romney: 'I represent a different path' Bachmann wants to be voice to unite GOP Romney's 'Under 50' problem \u201cHe is going to have to do his Etch A Sketch very quickly here,\u201d said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, referencing a Romney adviser\u2019s recent comment that Romney can \u201cshake it up\u201d after the primary and \u201cstart all over again\u201d in the general. \u201cHe is coming out of a primary with the highest negatives and lowest positives as any nominee in memory,\u201d Messina told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad place for him to be.\u201d Repairing damage from the primaries Repairing that political damage was surely on the agenda on Thursday when Romney took a day off from campaigning and huddled with his advisers in Boston for a series of strategy sessions about the general election. According to people present at the meetings, the close-knit Romney team was in good spirits after its toughest rival, Rick Santorum, dropped out of the race and cleared a path to the nomination. But Romney and his staff were also clear-eyed about the task ahead. \u201cWe celebrated for like 12 minutes, and now we\u2019re ready to move on to the general and do the things you have to do to get ready to go up against a bunch of guys who are really good,\u201d said one Romney confidante. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t underestimate how good they are. And we\u2019re not bad either.\u201d The mechanics of a general election \u2013 fundraising, scheduling, coordinating tactics with the Republican National Committee \u2013 should come easy to a campaign filled with technocrats and data hounds who reflect the managerial personality of their candidate. But the campaign is still figuring out how to package Romney, a successful but dispassionate figure who faces questions about his core beliefs, against Obama, who continues to be well liked on a personal level in polls despite his flat job approval numbers. The latter question \u2013 whether Obama is up to the job \u2013 will be the central issue of the 2012 race and the core message of the Romney campaign, said his top strategist Stuart Stevens. Romney slams Obama on 'Buffett Rule' Robert De Niro on Mitt Romney Previewing the general election \u201cThis is a race about the direction the country and the economy and whether or not the president made things better and easier on people\u2019s daily lives since he\u2019s been elected,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd overwhelmingly, most Americans think that it hasn\u2019t.\u201d Wounds are healing quickly Just a few weeks ago, many leading Republicans would have said the most pressing demand for Romney after the long and disruptive primary process would be to unite the party. But those wounds seem to healing more quickly than many Republicans and Democrats anticipated, despite public grousing about Romney from prominent leaders on the right such as Tony Perkins and Gary Bauer. Santorum, who once attacked Romney as \u201cthe ultimate flip-flopper\u201d and the \u201cworst Republican in the country\u201d to challenge Obama\u2019s on the issue of health care reform, is now calling on the party to put aside ideology and work together to defeat the president. \u201cI know there will always be complaints about, well, \u2018I don\u2019t like this candidate or that candidate, or they are not as good on these issues or not,\u2019 \u201d Santorum told the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association on Friday. \u201cWe have got to win in this general election. \u2026 I pledge to you that even though I am no longer in this race that I will be all in between now and November.\u201d Romney, never an icon of the right, received a warm welcome at the NRA meeting, where the mere mention of the president\u2019s name elicited furious boos \u2013 anecdotal evidence that anger toward Obama might be enough to motivate the Republican base even if Romney fails to do so on his own. Polling bears that out: A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday showed that 63% of Romney supporters say they will be voting against Obama instead of voting for Romney. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think the issue of reuniting the party is going to be as hard as some of the political commentators have said, because I think the strong unifying force and desire to beat Obama will overcome a lot of those problems,\u201d said former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a Romney supporter. Senior Republicans in Washington are increasingly confident that seven months of relentless focus on economic issues will be enough to turn the tide among independent voters while keeping the base fired up. Romney supporters also say the much-discussed \u201cgender gap\u201d between Obama and Romney will shrink once the Republican primary becomes a distant memory. The president\u2019s job approval rating among women, they point out, is only at 49%, according to a recent Gallup survey. A CNN/ORC International poll released Tuesday had the number at 55%. GOP focus: Obama\u2019s economic policies Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a longtime player in Republican politics, said the news media\u2019s relentless focus on the GOP primary during the past six months overshadowed the lackluster presidential approval ratings that make Obama so vulnerable. Romney can fix his standing if he makes the race a referendum on Obama\u2019s economic policies, he argued. \u201cThis campaign is going to be waged in the center,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cThe party apparatus, the conservatives, the tea party, the organizations like small businesses and the NRA, they will be very active in providing volunteers and our base will be very active,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s critically important. But the election is going to decided by a few million people, most of whom voted for Obama last time but have the same level of buyer\u2019s remorse as ticket purchasers on the Titanic.\u201d Charlie Black, a top adviser to John McCain\u2019s presidential bid who is now offering counsel to Romney, noted that independents broke for Obama by eight points in 2008 but swung hard in the other direction two years later after a debate over the economy. \u201cSo who are those people who switched? That\u2019s the battleground for this election,\u201d Black told CNN. \u201cWhat they cared about then and what they care about now is the economy and jobs and big government.\u201d \u2018Conservatives will come around\u2019 Meanwhile, Black said, Romney and his emissaries are assuring conservative leaders that they are the same team. \u201cConservatives will come around,\u201d Black told CNN. \u201cThe fact is, his positions are perfectly fine with the base. The organized conservative movement just needs to have some communication and encouragement to come on board.\u201d With Republicans beginning to close ranks around Romney, fewer and fewer party insiders are willing to go on the record with outright criticisms of the likely nominee. But questions linger among some GOP leaders about whether Romney badly damaged his chances among Hispanics, a crucial voting bloc in swing states Colorado, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico and Virginia, with his hard line immigration positions. During the primary, Romney called for \u201cself-deportation,\u201d embraced Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration crackdown and came out against the DREAM Act, which would create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who enroll in college or sign up for military service. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, called the candidates\u2019 rhetoric on immigration \u201charsh.\u201d Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called the discourse \u201ctroubling.\u201d Said one top-level adviser to one of Romney\u2019s GOP rivals: \u201cI think the way Gov. Romney chose to deliver his immigration position could be construed as mean-spirited, and we need, as Republicans, to be reaching out to all Americans not singling out certain factions with mean-spirited rhetoric.\u201d Democrats will find seek out every opportunity to remind voters of the conservative stances Romney took in the primary \u2013 his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, for instance, or his opposition to the auto bailout \u2013 that may damage him among key constituencies in a handful of battleground states. The presidency, after all, could hinge on a few thousand votes in the suburbs of Cincinnati or Denver or Las Vegas. Romney might end up with little wiggle room in the face of such attacks thanks to the Etch A Sketch flare up in March, when he promised not to shift his positions in the general election. \u201cThe issues I am running on will be exactly the same,\u201d Romney said at the time, trying to calm the political storm that exploded on Twitter and cable news. \u201cI am running as a conservative Republican.\u201d Messina, Obama\u2019s campaign chief, said he plans to keep memories of the Republican primary like that one alive well into the fall. \u201cHe took those positions because he believes those things, and he is not going to be able to paint a new picture,\u201d Messina said of Romney.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney seeks to fix his gender gap problem against President Obama With Rick Santorum's withdrawal, the campaign shifts to general election mode Obama continues his push for millionaires to pay higher taxes An Obama campaign video highlights Romney's conservative stances President Barack Obama and his certain Republican opponent in November, Mitt Romney, shifted to full general election mode Wednesday, portraying each other as threats to future American progress as their campaigns engaged in a \u201cwar over women\u201d indicative of what to expect for the next seven months. A day after his path to the GOP nomination cleared by chief rival Rick Santorum\u2019s withdrawal, Romney sought to reverse a gender gap problem by attacking Obama\u2019s economic policies as bad for women. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday, Romney trails well behind Obama among women voters \u2013 a result also seen in recent Gallup and CNN/ORC polls. Obama had the support of 57% of women, compared with 38% who said they backed Romney, while Romney had the backing of 52% of men, compared with 44% who backed Obama, the survey found. In a speech in Delaware at a woman-owned small business, Romney referred Wednesday to a Democratic attack line that Republicans were waging a \u201cwar on women\u201d through socially conservative policies involving abortion, health care and other issues by saying: \u201cThe real war on women is being waged by the president\u2019s failed economic policies.\u201d Romney: Santorum will have role in party Santorum supporters weigh options Will conservatives coalesce for Romney? Politicians riff on women, dates \u201cNow the president says, \u2018Oh I didn\u2019t cause this recession.\u2019 That\u2019s true,\u201d Romney said. \u201cHe just made it worse, and made it last longer. And because it lasted longer, more and more women lost jobs, such that in his three-and-a-half years, 92.3% of the people who lost jobs have been women. His failures have hurt women.\u201d However, the nonpartisan website PolitiFact.com rated the 92.3% job loss statement \u201cmostly false,\u201d saying it included figures from the beginning of the Obama administration, before his policies could take effect. In addition, PolitiFact.com said the figure failed to reflect a historical pattern of recessions first causing unemployment in traditionally male-dominated industries such as construction, and then later affecting fields with larger percentages of female workers. The Romney campaign later provided a copy of a letter it sent to PolitiFact.com that challenged the \u201cmostly false\u201d rating. An analysis of federal labor statistics shows that the Romney claim is technically true but lacks important context. The number of nonfarm-employed women from January 2009, when Obama took office, to March 2012 fell far more than the number of employed men in that period. The total job loss for the period for both men and women combined was 740,000. The number of women who lost nonfarm jobs in that time span was 683,000, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That amounts to 92.3% \u2013 the figure Romney cited. However, the statistic does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job loss pie in the year leading up to Obama\u2019s inauguration. In the 2008 calendar year, men lost a total of 2.7 million nonfarm jobs, compared with 895,000 jobs lost for women. Men made up 75.4% of the 3.6 million jobs lost that year. Romney\u2019s claim also does not reflect that the job losses for women began in March 2008, almost a full year before Obama took office. At that point, women held a total of 67.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs, the highest level of female employment of the Bush administration. From that high point, the number of women with nonfarm payroll jobs fell for 23 consecutive months, spanning from the final 10 months of the Bush administration and first 13 months of the Obama administration. Since February 2010, women have actually gained 863,000 jobs. Meanwhile, a Romney adviser initially hesitated when asked if Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act that expands workers\u2019 rights to sue in the event of a pay discrepancy between a man and a woman. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you on that,\u201d Romney Campaign Policy Director Lanhee Chen told reporters. A Romney campaign statement afterward said the candidate supported pay equity for women, but it did not specifically say he backed the 2009 Ledbetter law. The Obama campaign immediately fired back, issuing a statement from Ledbetter that criticized Romney for failing to \u201cstand up for women and their families.\u201d \u201cAnyone who wants to be president of the United States shouldn\u2019t have to think about whether they support pursuing every possible avenue to ensuring women get the same pay for the same work as men,\u201d Ledbetter said in the statement. A Romney campaign official later said that  the candidate had no plans to change the current pay equity laws if elected. David Axelrod, the senior adviser to Obama\u2019s campaign, called it a \u201ctough day\u201d for Romney\u2019s efforts to repair damage with women voters stemming from the Republican primary campaign. Axelrod dubbed the those efforts the \u201cMitt Rehab with Women Tour\u201d in a Twitter post. Obama, meanwhile, continued his push for Congress to pass a tax measure that would ensure that millionaires \u2013 like Romney \u2013 pay a higher tax rate than middle-class workers. \u201cIt\u2019s just plain wrong that middle-class Americans pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some millionaires and billionaires,\u201d Obama told a White House event, flanked by millionaires who support the proposed measure. Republicans want to cut taxes for the wealthy, which would mean cutting spending on programs that spur economic growth and benefit the middle class, senior citizens and the poor, Obama argued. \u201cThey want to double down on some of the inequities that already exist in the tax code,\u201d he said, adding that such a step means \u201ceither you\u2019ve got to borrow more money to pay down a deeper deficit, or you\u2019ve got to demand deeper sacrifices from the middle class and you\u2019ve got to cut investments that help us grow as an economy.\u201d Citing \u201csignificant\u201d deficits and the need to be competitive in the 21st century\u2019s \u201ctechnologically integrated economy,\u201d Obama said: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for wealthy Americans who don\u2019t need them and weren\u2019t even asking for them.\u201d In a swipe at GOP economic policy, Obama added: \u201cIn America, prosperity has never just trickled down from the wealthy few.\u201d Also Wednesday, the Obama campaign released a video highlighting Romney\u2019s conservative stances on issues such as abortion rights, health care reform and immigration reform. The video concludes with Romney\u2019s declaration on the campaign trail that he was \u201ca severely conservative Republican governor.\u201d The competing messages were attempts by both sides to frame what is expected to be a close and vicious general election campaign in a favorable perspective. Obama portrays Romney and Republicans as protectors of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, while Romney and his party say Obama has stifled economic recovery and failed to effectively tackle deficit reduction. Romney still needs to win several hundred delegates to clinch the GOP nomination, but Santorum was his top remaining challenger, and Tuesday\u2019s announcement that Santorum suspended his campaign leaves Romney\u2019s path free of obstacles. However, Romney\u2019s campaign still struggles to generate enthusiasm among the GOP conservative base, which questions his more moderate stances as Massachusetts governor. Sources said Romney wants Santorum \u2013 who had strong support among social conservatives, including Christian evangelicals \u2013 to quickly endorse his campaign. While Romney and Santorum aides said the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania will work to defeat Obama, it was unclear when or if Santorum would offer a full-throated endorsement for Romney. In his announcement Tuesday that he was suspending his campaign, Santorum never mentioned Romney. \u201cI expect when I finally become the nominee, and I hope that happens soon, that we\u2019ll be campaigning together, we\u2019ll be working together,\u201d Romney said Wednesday. \u201cWe share very much the same beliefs about the course the nation must take and the fact that under this president, America is not going in the right direction.\u201d Santorum has consistently said Republicans needed a true conservative candidate \u2013 himself \u2013 to defeat Obama, and he has relentlessly attacked Romney\u2019s support for health care reforms in Massachusetts that included a mandate for coverage similar to the 2010 federal health care law despised by conservatives. Romney said he would try to attract Santorum\u2019s evangelical and socially conservative supporters by leveraging appearances with the former candidate. \u201cWe campaign together and make sure we see these people and get a chance to talk to them about issues that all Americans care about,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI think you see our party, and you will see our party more united than it\u2019s been in a long, long time, in part because President Obama has taken America in such a different course than we have ever gone as a nation before.\u201d Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, the other Republican challengers who trail far back, said they intended to stay in the race to the GOP convention in August. The Obama campaign immediately took aim at Romney after Santorum\u2019s announcement, with campaign manager Jim Messina saying it was \u201cno surprise that Mitt Romney finally was able to grind down his opponents under an avalanche of negative ads.\u201d \u201cThe more the American people see of Mitt Romney, the less they like him and the less they trust him,\u201d Messina said in a statement. \u201cWhile calling himself the \u2018ideal candidate\u2019 for the tea party, he has promised to return to the same policies that created the economic crisis and has alienated women, middle-class families and Hispanic Americans.\u201d CNN\u2019s latest estimate of the GOP delegate tally shows Romney with 659, Santorum with 275, Gingrich with 140 and Paul with 71. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination. New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware vote on April 24, in addition to Pennsylvania. In all, 231 delegates are up for grabs in the five states. The goal now for Gingrich and Paul is to prevent Romney from reaching the 1,144-delegate threshold before the convention. On Wednesday, though, Gingrich spent time explaining how a technical glitch caused his campaign to bounce a $500 check for Utah primary election fees.

            "article_content": "American Legislative Executive Council getting attention for pushing conservative legislation Group was behind the spread of \"stand your ground\" laws This week, Coca-Cola and Kraft say they are pulling corporate memberships from group The group has ties to the NRA, which has extended its reach beyond gun rights advocacy This week, Coca-Cola and Kraft announced they are pulling their corporate memberships from a conservative group that was behind the spread of \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws like the one highlighted in Florida by the Trayvon Martin case. The American Legislative Executive Council, also known as ALEC, is getting attention lately for its behind the scenes work pushing conservative legislation in the states. The group has gotten even more attention since a neighborhood watch volunteer shot and killed unarmed teenager Martin last month. The man who shot Martin, George Zimmerman, said he acted in self-defense. Police haven\u2019t charged him and legal experts say Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law may shield Zimmerman from prosecution. The National Rifle Association worked with ALEC to spread similar laws that are on the books in at least 25 states. Those laws grow directly out of the Second Amendment ethos the NRA has championed: \u201cthe ethos of individualism, of having a gun, of individuals taking the initiative,\u201d said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Cortland and at Cornell University who has studied and written about the NRA for decades. Opinion: When soda pop and politics don\u2019t mix Less well known is that the NRA has also helped ALEC spread other conservative laws that have nothing to do with gun rights. ALEC drafts and shares model bills with state legislators to promote corporation-friendly and conservative social policy. A watchdog group called the Center for Media and Democracy first documented the NRA\u2019s role in these bills with ALEC. An NRA lobbyist, Tara Mica, helped shepherd a model bill that requires voters to show a photo ID at the polls. Many conservatives have pushed voter ID laws to prevent election fraud. Many liberals say these laws inhibit voting by minorities. Mica also helped preside over ALEC\u2019s passage of the model bill that became the basis of Arizona\u2019s immigration law. That\u2019s the law that requires police to arrest anyone who cannot prove when asked that they entered the United States legally. The NRA  and Mica wouldn\u2019t talk with CNN, so it\u2019s not known whether Mica consulted with other NRA officials about the bills on voter ID and immigration. ALEC also declined to answer questions. Lisa Graves with the Center for Media and Democracy said the way ALEC works, \u201cWe know a bill cannot be approved as a model bill if the private sector members, like the NRA or Walmart, don\u2019t want it to become a model bill.\u201d Josh Horwitz heads an advocacy group called the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. He said the NRA\u2019s role with ALEC cements his view that the NRA is really a base for the conservative movement. \u201cPeople think the NRA is just a gun group. It\u2019s really not.\u201d Horwitz said. Horwitz\u2019s group has created a cheeky website, \u201cMeet the NRA.org.\u201d It lists the NRA\u2019s board of directors, and it has a rolling information bar that features some of their more colorful statements. The NRA\u2019s board includes Grover Norquist, president of  Americans for Tax Reform, and David Keene, former chairman of the American Conservative Union. The board also includes Robert Brown, creator of Soldier of Fortune magazine, and rock guitarist Ted Nugent. Spitzer said the NRA has gotten involved in some other non-gun issues. For instance, he said, the NRA fought hard against campaign finance reform in the days of McCain-Feingold. \u201cThey were taking a very much free-enterprise, government-hands-off-the-campaign-process (approach),\u201d he said. But Spitzer said the NRA will always be primarily about guns and what they stand for in the individualist American mythology. He said the NRA\u2019s work is cut out for it, because gun ownership is on the decline in America.",

            "article_content": "Court prepares to tackle perhaps the most important appeals to reach it in more than a decade Rulings could establish precedents in regulation over a range of social areas SCOTUSblog editor: \"The implications ...  are impossible to overstate\" Constitutionality of the reform's individual mandate is a key point of the case Most of us go about our daily business never thinking about the U.S. Supreme Court or the cases it decides. But sometimes, it gets a case so big \u2013 and could affect your life so much \u2013 you simply have to take notice. This week is one of those times. The highest court in the land is preparing to tackle perhaps the most important appeals to reach it in more than a decade: the massive health care reform legislation championed by President Barack Obama. The court will soon hear six hours of oral arguments over three days on the law\u2019s constitutionality \u2013 and your health and your finances could be on the line. Their eventual rulings in an election year will not only guide how every American receives medical care but would also establish precedent-setting boundaries of government regulation over a range of social areas. \u201cThe implications in the health care litigation are impossible to overstate,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, a prominent Washington attorney and publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. \u201cIt has tremendous consequences for President Obama\u2019s re-election because it\u2019s a signature achievement. But in terms of law, this case is really going to decide how much power Congress has to regulate spheres that we\u2019ve often thought of as the jobs of the states or of just individuals.\u201d A century of federal efforts to offer universal health care culminated with the 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. After months of bare-knuckled fights over politics and policy, the legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and 450 some provisions. Health care reform's day in court Truth about health care Explaining the health care debate The U.S. Supreme Court: How it works The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed traditional hot-button topics: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life-care and the overall economy. The high court now gets the final word. \u201cThese issues are really central to whether the federal government can regulate anything it wants to, or whether there are some things that only the state governments can regulate,\u201d said Paul Clement, the attorney who will argue against the law, on behalf of a coalition of 26 states. On the other side are progressives who back the Obama administration and its congressional supporters. \u201cCongress thought it necessary to regulate the nearly 20% of our nation\u2019s economy that makes up the health care industry and to make sure insurance companies did not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, for example,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cThat is squarely within Congress\u2019 authority.\u201d Your guide to the arguments Debate comes down to four key issues Despite its complexity, the high court has narrowed its focus to just four key issues: One: Constitutionality of the individual mandate (also known as the \u201cminimum coverage\u201d requirement), the key funding provision. Two: Whether the individual mandate is a \u201ctax,\u201d thereby limiting authority of the courts to immediately decide the mandate question. Three: Whether other parts of the law can survive if the mandate is struck down. Four: Federal vs. state conflict over expansion of the cooperative Medicaid program. It is the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d that has sparked the most controversy. It requires nearly every American to purchase some level of insurance or face a tax penalty of up to about $700 a year. Typical of the ideological divide, the opposing sides do not even agree on what the individual mandate was designed to accomplish. Supporters see it a way of spreading health care costs to a larger pool of individuals, ensuring affordable, quality medical care. They say regulating commerce and the economy has long been a federal prerogative. Health law supporter: \u2018It really is going to help the American public\u2019 The Justice Department will tell the high court that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not \u201cchoose\u201d to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. Health law opponent: \u2018Congress made a bad situation worse\u2019 But opponents see a fundamental constitutional violation, an intrusion into citizens\u2019 personal lives, forcing Americans to purchase a commercial product they might not want or need. The states equate such a requirement to a burdensome regulation of \u201cinactivity.\u201d One federal appeals court has found the act unconstitutional. Two others have has said it is a proper exercise of congressional mandate. A third court has ruled against the states on technical grounds, saying local officials lack authority to even go into to court and argue the individual mandate issue. Twenty-eight states and countless individuals and groups have sued the administration. What the reform is designed to do Health care reform, a top Democratic priority since the Truman administration, was passed by the previous Congress in a series of close party-line votes. Obama signed the act into law in March 2010. Among other things, the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government-imposed mandates and subsidies. The federal government will tell the court that 45 million Americans last year lacked health insurance, roughly 15% of the country\u2019s population. Critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine, fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy will result in higher taxes and diminished health care services. Opponents derisively labeled the measure \u201cObamacare.\u201d Republican leaders, who captured the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections, have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law. All the major GOP candidates for president have echoed similar calls, especially in their TV campaign ads. That has concerned some liberal legal analysts. \u201cIt seems what the conservative state attorneys general and the governors were trying to do was seek a do-over of the act in the courts, to achieve what they couldn\u2019t in the legislature. And it really has become a bit of political theater,\u201d says Wydra. \u201cIf the Supreme Court and especially some of the conservative justices uphold the mandate, and deliver the message to the tea party that their constitutional vision is fundamentally flawed, that makes it much harder for tea party candidates and their supporters to have their constitutional theories taken seriously by the American people.\u201d Supreme Court and election-year blockbusters But the states worry how far the federal government would go in the future, all in the name of regulating \u201ccommerce,\u201d if the high court found the law constitutional. \u201cI think about just a couple of years ago when the automobile industry was suffering, and Congress said: we\u2019re going to give people incentives to buy new cars,\u201d said Clement. \u201cWell, it would have been even more effective and even better for the car industry if Congress had just said: if you make more than $100,000, you need to buy a new car. They haven\u2019t done that, maybe it\u2019s self-restraint, maybe it\u2019s because the [sweeping] power really doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s really what the court is going to decide.\u201d How the justices could rule The entire court of nine justices will hear the case, despite separate calls for Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan to recuse. They will have several options before them when issuing opinions in these cases. They could separately strike down or uphold the individual mandate and Medicaid provisions and rule whether the entire law must be scrapped. Or they could declare a legal \u201ctime-out\u201d\u2013 concluding the constitutional questions must be postponed until the major provisions go into effect in 2014, when any real \u201charm\u201d from the financial mandates would presumably be felt. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform The opportunity to rule on a landmark case brings with it precedent-setting opportunities to either expand or deflate not only the power of Congress and the executive but also the judiciary\u2019s own prestige and authority. In some ways, it is a perilous path, since the courts have increasingly become a political football. \u201cWe\u2019re in a little bit of a political death spiral for the Supreme Court, as ideologues on the left and right attack justices with whom they disagree, maybe decreasing the public\u2019s confidence in the Supreme Court,\u201d said Scotusblog.com\u2019s Goldstein. \u201cAnd as they take up health care, abortion cases, immigration \u2013 all of those issues \u2013 there are going to be more excuses to attack the justices.\u201d So expect nine unelected judges and the tricky issues such as health care they confront to be major talking points in this year\u2019s state and federal elections. Their votes could ultimately decide whom Americans choose on Election Day 2012. \u201cOur job on the court is to decide \u2013 and control our stress,\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer told CNN a couple of years ago while discussing how to manage \u2013 personally and professionally \u2013 the biggest, most politically explosive Supreme Court appeals. \u201cKeep yourself under control. And do your best on the decision.\u201d That\u2019s wellness advice that could serve the nine-member bench \u2013 and anyone passionately folllowing the case \u2013 in the days to come. Read more about the rulings for yourself The cases are Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida (11-398); National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (11-393); and Florida v. Dept. of HHS (11-400). Rulings are expected in June.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Scott Brown backs bill for 10,500 special work visas for the Irish Brown represents Massachusetts, home to many Americans of Irish descent Brown's bill has been blocked by a fellow Republican who wants the bill changed The luck of the Irish may not be enough to push ahead special legislation introduced by Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, to grant 10,500 special work visas for Irish immigrants. Brown proposed the legislation in the midst of a neck-and-neck re-election battle in Massachusetts, which has the highest percentage of Americans of Irish descent. Brown is serving out the term of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was extremely popular with Irish-Americans because of his work on the Irish peace process. Brown has predicted that his legislation would \u201cpop\u201d soon, in plenty of time for St. Patrick\u2019s Day marches that are magnets for Northeast politicians. \u201cThe Irish economy crashed in 2008. People have come and overstayed visas. The Irish-American vote here is substantial,\u201d said Hugh Meehan, an Irish-American businessman in Boston. \u201cThis would be welcome relief and a recognition of the strong ties between Massachusetts and Ireland.\u201d But Numbers USA, a conservative organization that supports reducing immigration, is lobbying hard against the bill, questioning why the United States would bring in skilled foreign workers to compete with U.S. citizens in the midst of a recession. Roy Beck of Numbers USA called Brown\u2019s bill an election-year ploy to gain favoritism for one ethnic group. \u201cWhat about Mexicans? What about Asians and Africans?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no reason why we should give this privilege.\u201d The unemployment rate in Massachusetts, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 6.9%. The unemployment rate in Ireland is 14.2%. The renewable visas Brown\u2019s legislation seeks would expire every two years. The bill is also opposed by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization that typically sides with Republicans on immigration issues. It derided Brown\u2019s proposal as a throwback to the days when immigration was based on national origin. In addition, America\u2019s Voice, which calls itself non-partisan organization, said that while it supports reform of immigration laws it has called into question the motivations behind giving a special visa status to Irish nationals. On illegal immigration issues, which largely affect immigrants from Central and South America, Brown has been in line with his party. He has spoken against creating magnets for illegal immigration and has opposed the DREAM Act, which would grant permanent residency to college graduates who entered the United States illegally as children. But, in an e-mail statement to CNN, Brown\u2019s office said his E3 visa legislation was different. \u201cFor decades, the Irish have been unfairly shut out by our immigration laws. In an effort to increase visa prospects and maintain the close bond between the United States and Ireland, Sen. Brown is working in a bipartisan way to add the Irish E3 program to larger, House-passed visa legislation that benefits several other countries.\u201d In a recent editorial, the Boston Globe said Irish immigrants have already been given ample favoritism. \u201cBrown argues that Ireland deserves special visas because changes in U.S. immigration policy have disproportionately limited the numbers of Irish workers for decades. But Ireland has often benefited from temporary exemptions. In 1986, Rep. Brian J. Donnelly, a Massachusetts Democrat, pushed for a visa lottery that awarded 4,161 visas to Irish applicants out of the first 10,000. In the 1990s, Rep. Bruce Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat, created a program that gave out 120,000 green cards \u2013 48,000 reserved for Irish applicants, whose undocumented immigrants had been left out of an earlier amnesty program.\u201d Brown\u2019s Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Warren, said the visa system is badly broken. \u201cWe need to reform the visa system for talented Irish men and women coming to this country, and more generally we need to reform the visa system as a whole,\u201d she said. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, introduced legislation in the House in November that would eliminate per-country caps for employment-based immigration applications from countries with large backlogs like China and India. It would also grant visa waivers to undocumented Irish immigrants, a move widely unpopular with Republicans. Brown\u2019s standalone Senate bill on E3 visas for the Irish, S.2005, followed in December with no provision for undocumented immigrants. Brown\u2019s bill was added to Schumer\u2019s broader proposal, which eliminated the provision for undocumented immigrants. But Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed a hold on this bill when it came over to the Senate. Beth Levine, communications director for Grassley, said he has now extended an offer to move the Brown bill forward. \u201cAn up or down vote on Sen. Brown\u2019s Irish visa bill would be acceptable to Sen. Grassley with some modifications dealing with the skill level of those receiving an E3 visa, the current visa program the visas would be allotted from, and the inclusion of a sunset on the program,\u201d Levine wrote in an e-mail. \u201cSen. Grassley\u2019s staff is still discussing modifications with the sponsors of the bill.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Some leading Republicans think it's time to wrap up the race While Republican candidates spar, Obama campaign can quietly prepare for fall Some drawing parallels with 2008 Democratic campaign, which went into May Republican enthusiasm, support from independents falling as campaign goes on The campaigns of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney don\u2019t agree on much. But on one subject, officials from both sides are in sync. As the GOP primary race goes into its third official month, the biggest winner appears to be the president. Referring to rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, a Romney campaign staffer said, \u201cThe only person\u2019s odds of winning are increasing are President Barack Obama\u2019s,\u201d arguing it was time for Gingrich and Santorum to depart the race. Several leading Republicans have publicly echoed that sentiment in recent days, confronted with poll numbers showing the president\u2019s job approval rating above 50% for the first time in months \u2013 a far cry from last fall when he was mired in the low 40s. Matalin: New Obama movie will backfire Obama campaign film sneak peek How will Romney fare in the South? Cantor responds to Gingrich accusation The ongoing Republican infighting has dragged down Romney\u2019s favorability rating among swing voters, forced him to awkwardly pivot right from stances that otherwise would have resonated with a broader electorate in the fall and led to a series of gaffes that could have been avoided had the former Massachusetts governor sewed up the nomination weeks ago. All the while, Obama\u2019s own campaign machinations have largely skated under the radar, allowing him to appear to be the adult in the room as the Republican candidates fight over contraception, illegal immigration, the minimum wage and each others\u2019 pasts. In the process, Obama\u2019s favorability among key voting blocs such as women and Latinos has jumped significantly.  And most important, recent surveys suggest the president has rebounded among independent voters, a swath of the electorate that catapulted him to victory four years ago but had abandoned him during his presidency. Equally disturbing to Republicans are a series of recent surveys showing the president handily beating Romney in a head-to-head contest, a reversal from October when Romney held a slight lead. That trend led conservative stalwart George Will last week to forecast Romney is headed for a Barry Goldwater-esque defeat come November. Ongoing Republican sniping has also allowed the Obama campaign to steadily build its campaign apparatus behind the scenes, opening scores of field offices in every key state out of which staffers and volunteers methodically resurrect the unparalleled get-out-the-vote effort from four years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re using this time to build while they\u2019re destroying each other,\u201d top Obama adviser David Axelrod said earlier this week. The campaign has also restricted its advertising to one positive spot on the president\u2019s energy policy, a subject Democrats believe will be among the key issues in the fall as gas prices rise. The campaign is also set to release a 17-minute documentary-style video next week showcasing the president\u2019s achievements during his first term. At the same time, Obama\u2019s lack of a direct opponent has allowed him to stay on message and conduct the re-election bid on his own terms. Conveniently, Obama avoids commenting on his likely Republican opponent until the nomination is actually wrapped up. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the president from goading the Republicans at nearly every turn, often trying to upstage them \u2013 like his White House news conference on the GOP\u2019s Super Tuesday \u2013 before every key primary this season. Of course, it was only four years ago when some Democrats were making similar doom-and-gloom predictions about their own contentious nominating fight, during which then-Sen. Hillary Clinton and Obama exchanged heated rhetoric well into May. But forecasts that such bickering would harm the eventual nominee\u2019s candidacy were all but forgotten two months later when Clinton offered a resounding endorsement of her onetime opponent at the Democrats\u2019 national convention. Meanwhile, fears that Clinton\u2019s ardent supporters wouldn\u2019t vote for Obama come November largely never materialized. Republicans are holding out hope for a similar outcome on their side, mindful that most Americans aren\u2019t paying close heed to the ins and outs of the GOP race. \u201cI get the feeling there\u2019s a real disconnect between the political class that\u2019s paying attention to all of this and what the public thinks,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary to President George W. Bush and a CNN contributor. He\u2019s predicting that most of the GOP infighting will be forgotten once the party rallies around a nominee. \u201cI\u2019m seeing more and more conservatives who aren\u2019t Romney fans starting to say, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s time to start fighting Barack Obama and stop fighting ourselves,\u2019 \u201d Erick Erickson, a CNN contributor and founder of Redstate.com, said earlier this week. But senior officials on the president\u2019s campaign argue the parallels between 2008 and 2012 are tenuous at best.  For starters, the long Democratic primary campaign four years ago was widely believed to burnish Obama as a candidate.  Not so with Romney, who has made a string of verbal missteps and shows little sign of getting more comfortable on the campaign trail. Democrats also argue the Obama and Clinton sniping pales in comparison to that of the Republican candidates this year, each of whom have spent millions of dollars on negative commercials and have sparred repeatedly during 20 televised debates. The result is a Republican primary electorate largely unsatisfied with its crop of candidates and showing little enthusiasm at the polls. \u201cThat lack of enthusiasm among Republicans is real, and it\u2019s unmistakable,\u201d said Jim Messina, the president\u2019s campaign manager, pointing to low voter turnout figures.  Adding to that contention is a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showing GOP enthusiasm since the fall has ticked down 13 points, to 51%. Finally, the president\u2019s supporters maintain Obama and Clinton did not shift leftward on key positions during their primary battle, forestalling the need for an awkward trek back to the middle during the fall campaign. In contrast, Romney has been forced to embrace more conservative positions on several key issues that could make courting independent voters difficult come November. \u201cThey think they can wipe the slate clean,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cThe American people take his words seriously and his positions seriously \u2026 we\u2019re going to hold him to them.\u201d",

Yet even in a cycle where he\u2019s already endured far more do-or-die contests than expected, these wins may be his most valuable yet. Romney succeeded in both states when it counted most, largely on the strength of the same voting blocs that have consistently backed his campaign. The older, richer and better-educated you were, the more likely you were to vote for Romney. If you made your decision before the primary season began, or if beating President Barack Obama was your top priority, and the economy was your biggest concern, then Romney was your pick. The outlook for Romney was sunny in the Southwest. He scored solidly with most Arizona demographics on his way to his more comfortable win of the night, winning pluralities in every age group, income level and major religious denomination, helped in part by overwhelming support from the state\u2019s sizable Mormon population. But it wasn\u2019t just a Mormon-fueled win: He even beat Rick Santorum among Santorum\u2019s fellow Catholics. Romney wins big in Arizona, Michigan Is Romney's momentum back? RNC chairman on Romney's wins Candidates sound off after primaries Debates mattered in Arizona, but early voting mattered more: More than half the state\u2019s voters said they had made up their mind before February began. And thanks to the early-voting option, 300,000 Republicans cast votes before Election Day arrived. Both of those groups broke heavily for Romney. Santorum may have had the wind at his back late in the race \u2013 but thanks to the Romney campaign\u2019s organizational savvy, its candidate had already banked enough early votes to help him weather the storm. In Arizona, where immigration issues take center stage, Romney\u2019s position on immigration \u2013 the toughest of the remaining candidates \u2013 helped him make major inroads with the state\u2019s most conservative voters. But his stance didn\u2019t cost him with the state\u2019s Latino Republicans: Romney\u2019s 35% showing with that group was a roughly 50% boost over his support four years ago, when he ran against home state senator, John McCain. It also secured him a double-digit win over Santorum among that demographic. There were some atypical results in Michigan, too. It\u2019s impossible to say how much the roughly 10% of Tuesday night\u2019s voters who described themselves as Democrats were influenced by \u201cOperation Hilarity,\u201d a liberal effort to sustain Santorum\u2019s candidacy by supporting him at the polls. But more than half of the Michigan Democrats who voted Tuesday backed the former senator from Pennsylvania, who managed a rare feat: winning the voting blocs on both ends of the ideological spectrum \u2013 the most liberal voters and the most conservative. Romney had the edge with everyone else. But the exit polls also contained some of the same warning signs that have plagued him since voting began. About three in 10 of Tuesday\u2019s primary voters in Romney\u2019s home state described themselves as \u201cvery conservative,\u201d the key base of voters he\u2019s struggled to win over all year. That struggle continues: On Tuesday, half of those voters backed Santorum, while Romney managed a little more than a third. Evangelicals and the strongest tea party voters also supported Santorum. And, just as in other states so far, Romney\u2019s vote total Tuesday night appears to have declined from his 2008 haul, on his way to an even narrower victory in a state where he had a years-long organizational head start and a 2-to-1 spending advantage over his closest competitor. Even in Arizona, where Romney scored an easier win, Santorum still won a plurality of white evangelicals, voters most strongly opposed to abortion, and voters looking for a true conservative. And among the roughly one in five Arizona Republicans who said the religious beliefs of their presidential pick mattered \u201ca great deal,\u201d Santorum ended the night with a double-digit advantage, winning 44% of that group to Romney\u2019s 33%. Romney\u2019s wins may have moved his campaign a few vital degrees further away from crisis mode. But as the race moves to even bumpier terrain \u2013 including Southern states with large evangelical populations that weren\u2019t 2008 wins for Romney \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s results provide a glimpse of the scale of the challenge he still faces.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Newt Gingrich warns that liberal elitism threatens the United States Mitt Romney gets a key endorsement from Arizona's conservative governor Rick Santorum appears to downplay his chances in Tuesday's Arizona primary The outcome of the Michigan primary will significantly impact the Republican race Less than 48 hours before primaries in Arizona and Michigan, Mitt Romney received a key endorsement from Arizona\u2019s governor Sunday while his current main challenger, Rick Santorum, appeared to downplay his own chances of winning in the Grand Canyon State. The two are leading the pack in the Republican presidential campaign that includes former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul as it heads into a series of crucial contests in coming weeks, including Super Tuesday on March 6 when 437 delegates from 10 states will be at stake. Michigan is emerging as a showdown between Romney and Santorum, with the outcome expected to significantly impact the campaign. If Romney comes from behind in the polls to win the state considered home turf where his father was governor, he will cement his status as the lone front-runner and presumptive nominee. A Santorum victory would raise further questions about Romney\u2019s ability to attract broad conservative support in the primaries or against President Barack Obama in November\u2019s general election. Candidates battling for Michigan votes Candy's post-show analysis Sound of Sunday with Candy Crowley Trouble for the GOP in 2012? The latest polls from Michigan and Arizona put Romney and Santorum in a virtual tie in both states, but the trends show Romney increasing his support as Tuesday\u2019s primary approaches. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a tea party conservative known for legal and public clashes with Obama over immigration policy, announced her endorsement of Romney on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program Sunday. \u201cI think he has that pro-business background and he has that political history that I think he would serve America the best of all the candidates,\u201d Brewer said, adding that Romney also has the best chance of defeating Obama in November. Santorum cited negative ads by the Romney campaign and super PAC supporters for the tightening poll numbers, and he sounded resigned to a second-place finish in Arizona. \u201cThat\u2019s another tough state for us,\u201d Santorum told the NBC program. \u201cDemographically, it doesn\u2019t work quite as well for us as maybe some other states.\u201d Regardless, he said, the results of Tuesday\u2019s primaries would show the Republican nomination was down to a two-person race pitting him against Romney. Santorum and Gingrich are vying to be the main conservative challenger against the more moderate Romney. Gingrich is banking on a strong Super Tuesday performance in the Southern states of Georgia, which represented in Congress, and neighboring Tennessee to revitalize his flagging campaign. In his push for conservative support, Gingrich warned Sunday in remarks at a Georgia church that liberal elitism was threatening the country. \u201cYou have elites in the bureaucracy, elites in the judgeship, frankly elites in the news media, elites in the academic world, and elites in politics \u2013 and they would all like to impose on us an America that none of us believe in,\u201d Gingrich said. Paul, the libertarian champion who has a devoted but limited support base among mostly young followers, has waged a strategic campaign aimed at accumulating delegates so he can assert influence at the Republican convention in August. So far, Romney\u2019s advantage in money and organization have helped him fend off challenges from a succession of Republican contenders. On Sunday, Romney surrogates appeared on  talk shows to boost his chances ahead of the upcoming contests. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a strong Romney backer, declared on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cRick Santorum\u2019s not going to be the nominee,\u201d while Arizona Sen. John McCain told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he was \u201cconfident Mitt will do well on Tuesday night in Arizona and in Michigan and hopefully that will move this process forward so we can concentrate on the real adversary.\u201d Another veteran Senate Republican, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also told the CNN program that he expects Romney to win both states on Tuesday. While Graham has yet to endorse a candidate, he praised Romney for \u201cgetting better and better\u201d throughout the campaign season. \u201cRomney really has sharpened his skills, and I think that will pay dividends if he gets the nomination,\u201d Graham said. Meanwhile, the senior adviser to Obama\u2019s re-election campaign did his best Sunday to encourage a drawn-out Republican nomination process. Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, now advising Obama\u2019s campaign, told CNN that Santorum has a \u201clegitimate chance\u201d to become the GOP nominee and described the former Pennsylvania senator as a candidate with blue-collar appeal who is \u201cclearly somebody who has a very different economic background than Mitt Romney.\u201d Predicting Tuesday\u2019s contests in Michigan and Arizona will not be a \u201cclarifying event,\u201d Gibbs said he expects the primary to go on for \u201cweeks and weeks.\u201d A tea party group also sought to boost Santorum\u2019s candidacy Sunday, urging Michigan conservatives to donate money and back Santorum even if they support Gingrich in order to damage Romney\u2019s chances. \u201cNo matter who your preferred candidate might be down the road, if you want to stop Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum needs to stop Romney in Michigan,\u201d said an appeal from the Freedom\u2019s Defense Fund. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure that happens.\u201d Romney did a rare talk show appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in which he defended his stance against the auto industry bailout in 2008 and also parried questions about what critics call his inability as a wealthy businessman to connect with working-class Americans such as tea party conservatives. Last week, Romney\u2019s comment that his family owns several cars kept at different residences, including two Cadillacs driven by his wife, came under media scrutiny. \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t be perfect. I just am who I am,\u201d Romney said on the Fox program, later adding: \u201cIf people think that there is something wrong with being successful in America, then they better vote for the other guy, because I\u2019ve been extraordinarily successful and I want to use that success and that know-how to help the American people.\u201d Romney also pushed back against critics of his opposition to the government bailout of the auto industry when the recession hit in 2008. Democrats and their labor union supporters have highlighted the Romney stance in Michigan, saying he would have turned his back on workers in a time of need. To Romney, the issue is about government fiscal intervention in a market-driven industry. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen all sorts of businesses go in bankruptcy.  And they come out and are stronger,\u201d Romney said on Fox. \u201cThis is not the first time that an industry or a company has been in trouble.\u201d He said he opposed \u201cwriting checks\u201d when auto industry leaders asked for help, instead of forcing them into what he called a managed bankruptcy and then helping them recover. \u201cAfter bankruptcy, that was the time to give them the financial support, the guarantees to provide the help to get them out of bankruptcy,\u201d Romney added. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it would have been done best.\u201d However, Romney didn\u2019t directly respond when asked if his plan would have forced the automakers into a more severe form of bankruptcy that would have resulted in greater job losses and a more difficult recovery. Santorum went after Romney on the auto bailout issue, saying the former Massachusetts governor was ideologically inconsistent because he had supported the government bailout of Wall Street firms but opposed the help for the auto industry. \u201cMitt Romney supported his friends on Wall Street and then turned his back on the people of Detroit,\u201d Santorum told the ABC program \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d \u201cNow I say turned his back because he supports the concept of bailouts.  I don\u2019t.  And that\u2019s the difference between the two approaches.\u201d Santorum also continued to wrestle with the increased attention to his campaign since he surged to the top of polls in recent weeks following his sweep of contests in Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado earlier this month. In his appearances on ABC and NBC, he was questioned about comments last week that challenged Obama\u2019s push for students to attend college and the call more than 50 years ago by former President John F. Kennedy \u2013 the nation\u2019s first Roman Catholic president \u2013 for an absolute separation of church and state. On ABC, Santorum said the Kennedy speech \u2013 which sought to ease concerns about his faith interfering with his ability to govern \u2013 made him sick. \u201cWhat kind of country do we live that says only people of non-faith can come into the public square and make their case?\u201d Santorum said in seeking to link his interpretation of the Kennedy speech with his criticism of the Obama administration for what he calls impeding on religious freedom. \u201cThat makes me throw up and it should make every American who has seen from the president, someone who is now trying to tell people of faith that you will do what the government says, we are going to impose our values on you,\u201d Santorum said, later adding that imposition of government values was \u201cthe next logical step when people of faith, at least according to John Kennedy, have no role in the public square.\u201d On higher education, Santorum was asked about declaring calling Obama a snob for advocating that all American students go to college if possible. After first responding on ABC that not everyone wants or needs a college education to succeed, noting that a trade school or a music career were examples of alternative options, Santorum characterized the majority of U.S. colleges and universities as liberal-biased institutions that are biased against conservative thinkers and religious believers. \u201cWe have some real problems at our college campuses with political correctness, with an ideology that is forced upon people who, you know, who may not agree with the politically correct left doctrine,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cAnd one of the things that I\u2019ve spoken out on and will continue to speak out is to make sure that conservative and more mainstream, commonsense conservative and principles that have made this country great are reflected in our college courses and with college professors.  And at many, many, and I would argue most institutions in this country, that simply isn\u2019t the case.\u201d Some Republicans have warned that such strident conservative rhetoric would hurt the party\u2019s cause in the general election against Obama, when the GOP nominee will need the support of independents to win. Christie took that stance Sunday, telling the CBS program that he believed declaring Obama a snob over the higher education issue was \u201cprobably over the line.\u201d He also criticized Santorum for what he called \u201cnaked opportunism\u201d in questioning Romney\u2019s conservative credentials, noting Santorum endorsed Romney in 2008. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Ashley Killough and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney, Ron Paul slam Rick Santorum for defending earmarks Romney says Arizona immigration law \"a model\" for rest of the nation 'Cheerful' Newt Gingrich has another strong debate performance The four GOP presidential candidates had one last chance to state their case in front of the nation before Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Did one candidate stand out from the rest? Here are five things we learned from the CNN Arizona Republican Presidential Debate. Santorum weighed down by Washington It wasn\u2019t just that Romney and Ron Paul pressed him on his past support for earmarks, the Title X family planning program, the \u2018No Child Left Behind\u2019 education bill and his endorsement of moderate Republican Senator Arlen Specter over conservative Pat Toomey in the 2004 Pennsylania Senate primary. Santorum made matters worse for himself by aggressively defending his Beltway votes. Highlights from CNN debate in Arizona Analysts: Romney outperformed Santorum Rick Santorum under attack Perry: Race could go to convention He said he was \u201cproud\u201d to stand up for earmarks \u2013 which many conservatives view as wasteful government spending \u2013 after being elected to the House in 1990 and then to the Senate in 1994. \u201cCongress has a role of allocating resources when they think the administration has it wrong,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cI defended that at the time.  I\u2019m proud I defended it at the time, because I think they did make mistakes. I do believe there was abuse, and I said we should stop it, and as president I would oppose earmarks.\u201d His reputation probably wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that Google searches for the word \u201cearmark\u201d spiked dramatically during the debate, soaring upward by 2300%. Santorum\u2019s explanation of his vote for \u2018No Child Left Behind\u2019 was even more complicating. \u201cI have to admit, I voted for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was against the principles I believed in, but, you know, when you\u2019re part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake.\u201d His comment drew boos from the crowd, but Santorum pushed forward. \u201cYou know, politics is a team sport, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes you\u2019ve got to rally together and do something.\u201d To some conservatives, it may have sounded like Santorum was admitting to being part of the big government problem during the George W. Bush administration. Santorum\u2019s labored defense of his Capitol Hill resume not only reinforced the accusation that he is a tainted Washington insider. It also undermined the central theme of his candidacy, that he is the only true conservative in the Republican race. Santorum\u2019s defiance has its limits Opinion: Santorum missed his chance Obama's national security record Santorum felt 'smacked around a bit' Romney to Santorum: 'Look in the mirror' Santorum seems incapable of defending his record without going into extensive and sometimes problematic detail, often with a hint of annoyance. It\u2019s not a new phenomenon. When pressed about his record on the campaign trail, Santorum seems to relish verbal combat and defiantly spars with questioners, as his infamous January back-and-forth over same-sex marriage with college students in New Hampshire demonstrated. \u201cI\u2019ll defend everything I say,\u201d Santorum told reporters Wednesday after a rally in Phoenix. But now that he\u2019s in the spotlight as the national Republican frontrunner, Santorum is struggling to stick to the campaign playbook that says a candidate should deliver concise answers and move on. Santorum\u2019s senior adviser John Brabender said his candidate has trouble letting some accusations go unanswered. \u201cThe question is, should he just be fighting back against Romney, or should he be explaining his record,\u201d Brabender said. \u201cIt is his record, and I think he feels like he has a responsibility to defend it.\u201d Romney was happy to let him do that on Wednesday. Romney still tacking right Mitt Romney is no longer playing it safe when it comes to debates, framing his answers carefully with an eye on the general election. Just over a week after declaring himself \u201cseverely conservative\u201d in a major address to party activists in Washington, the former Massachusetts governor made a similar argument in Mesa. Santorum, Romney spar over taxes, debt \u201cSevere, strict,\u201d Romney said when asked what he meant by his \u201cseverely\u201d line. \u201cI was, without question, a conservative governor in my state.\u201d Romney: Obama 'attacking' the religious Santorum, Romney clash on earmarks Paul calls Santorum 'fake' during debate Romney framed his conservatism mostly in fiscal terms, saying he cut taxes 19 times and balanced the budget (even though he also raised some taxes and was required by state law to balance the budget). However, Romney also highlighted socially conservative positions he took as governor, and said he battled with the Democratic-controlled legislature over issues like abortion, embryonic stem cell research and immigration. Romney also won applause at President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign headquarters in Chicago when he called Arizona\u2019s tough immigration law \u201ca model\u201d for the rest of the nation. He was talking specifically to an employment verification system included in the Arizona law, but Democrats will almost certainly use the remark as a cudgel against him in the general election if he is the Republican nominee as they seek to drive a wedge between the GOP and Hispanics, who voted for Obama over John McCain by a 67%-31% margin in 2008. Confidence men Romney campaign advisers exuded confidence after the debate, clearly pleased that Santorum decided to dig in and aggressively defend his record in Washington before a national television audience. How confident were they? Romney message maven Stuart Stevens guaranteed a win next Tuesday in Michigan, where polls show the race essentially tied between Romney and Santorum. \u201cWe are going to win Michigan,\u201d Stevens told reporters in the spin room. \u201cWe are going to win Michigan.\u201d Stevens also dismissed as a \u201cparlor game\u201d the chatter among some Washington insiders that a savior candidate might swoop in at the Republican National Convention in Tampa and rescue the party from doom in November. \u201cI think it\u2019s what we believe when it\u2019s impossible to believe in Santa Claus anymore,\u201d Stevens said of the contested convention talk. \u201cThis party has a great candidate, Mitt Romney. And you saw tonight, Mitt Romney is ready to be president from day one.\u201d \u2018Cheerful\u2019 Gingrich scores Gingrich demonstrated that he\u2019s at his best when the pressure is off. No longer the embattled GOP frontrunner taking fire from all sides, the Gingrich who showed up Wednesday resembled the loose and free-wheeling candidate he was last summer, when his cash-starved campaign was left for dead and relying on debates for free media exposure. Though he couldn\u2019t resist a shot at the \u201celite media\u201d early on for holding Obama and Republicans to different standards on social issues, Gingrich mostly shied away from cheap applause lines. Instead, he stayed above the fray and outlined his ideas about energy, education and the auto industry with an upbeat air of confidence and authority. Asked to describe himself in one word, the sometimes-surly candidate went with \u201ccheerful.\u201d \u201cNewt has been criticized from time to time about being too strident,\u201d said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. \u201cTonight you saw Newt Gingrich, I think, channeling Ronald Reagan by saying the word that described him best was \u2018cheerful.\u2019 He truly is a cheerful warrior.\u201d A third Gingrich surge seems like a dim prospect before Super Tuesday on March 6, but the former House Speaker reminded viewers Thursday that he deserves a seat at the Republican table for at least the next two weeks.",

Voters in New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary begin choosing their GOP candidates as early as 12 a.m. Tuesday in two small towns \u2013 Dixville Notch and Hart\u2019s Location \u2013 while polling stations in the rest of the state open at 6 a.m. and close as late as 8 p.m. ET. The final day of campaigning saw Romney under fire for a comment about health insurance that quickly became fodder for criticism. Asked about the issue in Nashua, New Hampshire, Romney said he wanted a person to be able to own his or her own policy \u201cand perhaps keep it the rest of their life.\u201d \u201cThat means the insurance company will have the incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don\u2019t like what they do, you can fire them,\u201d he said. \u201cI like being able to fire people who provide services to me,\u201d Romney added. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t give me the good service I need, I want to say I am going to get somebody else to provide that service to me.\u201d Rival candidate Jon Huntsman immediately seized on the comment as an indication of Romney\u2019s political nature. \u201cIt has become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates Gov. Romney and me,\u201d Huntsman said in Concord. \u201cI will always put my country first.  It seems that Gov. Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov. Romney enjoys firing people. I enjoy creating jobs.\u201d The Democratic National Committee released a derisive Web video and called Romney \u201cout of touch,\u201d while the campaign of Texas Gov. Rick Perry looped Romney\u2019s words to make a cell phone ring tone that quickly went viral. Romney under fire in debate Campaign surrogates speak out No talking points: GOP's racial stumbles Huntsman: \"We have to show big\" Romney spent much of the rest of the day clarifying what he meant. At one point, Romney said he expected the comment to be taken out of context to try to hurt him, and his campaign issued a statement emphasizing he was talking about firing an insurance company, not people. \u201cOur opponents are taking Gov. Romney\u2019s comments completely out of context,\u201d said a statement by Gail Gitcho, the campaign\u2019s communications director. \u201cGov. Romney was talking about firing insurance companies if you don\u2019t like their service. That is something that most Americans agree with.\u201d The latest twist in the GOP presidential race came on the eve of the first primary election a week after Romney won the Iowa caucuses by just eight votes over former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. With Romney in front in polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina, the site of the first Southern state primary on January 21, rivals stepped up their attacks by questioning the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s business background and electability. In Manchester, former House speaker Newt Gingrich tore into Romney\u2019s record in the private sector at the helm of Bain Capital. Though Romney has said his work at the Boston-based private equity firm ultimately led to the creation of 100,000 jobs, Gingrich said Romney\u2019s pursuit of wealth exacted a huge cost. \u201cWhat you have to raise questions about is, somebody goes out, invests a certain amount of money, say $30 million, takes out an amount, say $180 million \u2013 six to one return \u2013 and then the company goes bankrupt,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cNow, you have to ask a question: Is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of other people and walk off with the money? Or is that, in fact, a little bit of a flawed system? And so I do draw a distinction between looting a company, leaving behind broken families and broken neighbors, and leaving behind a factory that should be there.\u201d Romney fired back that Gingrich and others were joining President Barack Obama in attacking the free enterprise system. \u201cAs we\u2019ll find out, free enterprise will be on trial,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI thought it was going to come from the president, from the Democrats, from the left, but instead it\u2019s coming from Speaker Gingrich and apparently others.\u201d Gingrich had vowed earlier to run a positive campaign. But his tone has changed since his poll numbers plunged over the past month and he came in fourth in last Tuesday\u2019s Iowa caucuses. \u201cMy conclusion after Iowa was very simple,\u201d he said Monday in Manchester in response to a question. \u201cYou could not engage in unilateral disarmament when 45% of all the ads being run were attacks on me. To do that would be to get out of the race.\u201d In Derry, New Hampshire, Santorum predicted the Republican field will narrow to a showdown between himself and Romney, \u201cand we\u2019ll win this race.\u201d Responding to a reporter\u2019s question about his electability, Santorum said the country is more likely to elect a \u201cstrong conservative\u201d than a man who has \u201crun (previous elections) as a liberal, a moderate, and a conservative.\u201d Santorum also cautioned voters to avoid the \u201cestablishment candidate.\u201d \u201cWhen we\u2019ve run establishment candidates, we\u2019ve lost,\u201d he said, referring to veteran candidates in past elections who he said were nominated because of a perception it was their due after long careers. \u201cWe lost with John McCain, we lost with Bob Dole. We lost with Gerry Ford.\u201d Perry, meanwhile, made fun of Romney\u2019s comment over the weekend that he knows what it\u2019s like to worry about getting a pink slip, questioning whether such a wealthy man as Romney would fear losing a job. Campaigning in South Carolina, the site of the next primary on January 21 and the first Southern state to weigh in, Perry said people there were out of work \u201cbecause of what Mitt Romney and Bain Capital did.\u201d Perry\u2019s decision to leave New Hampshire for South Carolina on Monday reflected his low poll numbers in the Granite State and hopes to revitalize his campaign in the traditionally conservative Palmetto State. Another candidate, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, said he was holding back on big spending in another upcoming key primary state \u2013 Florida. Paul, who has consistently been among the top three in polling, told CNN that he would focus instead on caucuses that come after Florida\u2019s primary on January 31. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a big campaign planned there, but they\u2019ll know we\u2019re there,\u201d Paul said in an interview. Florida was penalized by the Republican National Committee for moving its primary earlier than rules allowed, with its 99 delegates cut down to 50. Still, Florida is a critically important state for the general election. Asked about not focusing on Florida, Paul pointed out he had to prioritize spending his available campaign funding and had done well so far with a third-place finish in Iowa and polls showing him contending for second place behind Romney in New Hampshire. \u201cI think it tells you that we are realistic. That\u2019s the way we approached Iowa, we did pretty well there, and right now, polls are looking pretty good up here. So I think we\u2019re being realistic, we shouldn\u2019t be acting like the government and spend money we don\u2019t have,\u201d Paul said with a chuckle. Paul\u2019s campaign chairman, Jesse Benton, said the focus after South Carolina will be the caucus states of Nevada, Louisiana, and Maine, which offer a total of 98 delegates, and where Paul\u2019s aides hope to rack up enough to keep their campaign going all the way to the Republican Convention in Tampa, Florida. Paul also made clear that if he does better than expected here in New Hampshire and can raise more cash, his campaign might change course and compete more forcefully in Florida. \u201cWe have to wait and see how things go,\u201d Paul said. Huntsman, meanwhile, has made New Hampshire his make-or-break contest. He skipped campaigning in Iowa to spend all of his time stumping the Granite State, starting Monday in Lebanon in the north before working his way south to the coast. A new poll Monday night by  the American Research Group showed Huntsman\u2019s support rising, with 18% of respondents supporting him \u2013 good for second place behind the 37% support for consistent front-runner Romney. Paul was third at 17% and Santorum fourth with 11%, followed by Gingrich at 10% and Perry at 1%. The poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters had an error margin of 4%. Romney and other GOP candidates also targeted Obama with sharp rhetoric Monday. \u201cI am very concerned that over the last three years you have seen, America, a very difficult time,\u201d Romney told an afternoon event in Hudson, New Hampshire. \u201cThis has not been a continuation of America\u2019s greatness from the past.  I think it has been more of a detour than the destiny of America.  I actually think the president has tried, but he has failed.\u201d At a luncheon with business leaders in Greenville, South Carolina, Perry attacked the Obama administration for suing to block an immigration law recently enacted there, and he chided the National Labor Relations Board for intervening in the construction of a  Boeing Dreamliner facility in Charleston. \u201cSouth Carolina, you are in a state of war with the federal government,\u201d Perry said. In New Hampshire, the other candidates were busy. Gingrich had seven planned events Monday while Santorum scheduled six. However, Gingrich canceled his final event because of what his campaign said were security concerns over protesters at the entrance and exits. Paul started Monday by greeting a crush of voters in Manchester. \u201cI wonder what the fire marshal would think,\u201d he said as he shook hands. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it a secret.\u201d Paul, who has the backing of many libertarians, predicted he will do well in New Hampshire because of his appeal among the 40% of Granite Staters who say they\u2019re independent voters. \u201cI think the people here in New Hampshire are very independent-minded, and I have a strong appeal because I have challenged both the Republican and Democratic Party leadership, and that means they want a message of cleaning house,\u201d Paul said in Meredith.

Jon Huntsman GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign stepped up its criticism of conservative challenger Rick Santorum on Friday, continuing to hit the former Pennsylvania senator on his spending record while in Congress. For his part, Santorum was slated to hold three \u201cFaith, Family and Freedom\u201d town hall meetings in New Hampshire, now four days from its first-in-the-nation primary. In addition, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman and Ron Paul had events scheduled in the state. Romney holds a large lead in New Hampshire in most polls, which has resulted in high expectations for his performance next Tuesday.  The other candidates appear to be scrambling for a second-place finish that could provide them with momentum heading into the January 21 South Carolina primary. Catching Romney in South Carolina, however, may prove to be a slog for his Republican rivals.  A CNN/Time/ORC International poll released Friday shows 37% of likely GOP Palmetto State primary voters backing the former Massachusetts governor, compared with 19% for Santorum, 18% for Gingrich, and 12% for Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The survey\u2019s sampling error is plus-or-minus 4.5 points. Stumping Friday morning with Romney in South Carolina, Sen. John McCain or Arizona blasted Santorum\u2019s defense of earmarks \u2013 federal spending designated for specific projects in individual states or districts.  Tea party activists and other conservatives frequently cite earmarks as prime examples of what they see as out-of-control spending in Washington. McCain makes another campaign flub Santorum's not in Iowa anymore Santorum booed at New Hampshire event \u201cEarmarks are a gateway to corruption,\u201d McCain said.  \u201cWhen Rick Santorum sponsored earmark after earmark, I went down to the floor and fought against those. \u2026 I guarantee you (Romney) will fight against it time after time after time, and we will stop the waste.\u201d Romney is \u201cgoing to know that spending matters,\u201d declared South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, another supporter of the former governor.   \u201cThat\u2019s why I know he is right as the president.\u201d Santorum responded that the federal government\u2019s big problem with spending is entitlement programs, not earmarks.  \u201cThere is where the big, unfunded liabilities are,\u201d he said.  \u201cCandidly, this is John McCain trying to put his imprimatur on the Republican conservative movement.\u201d Santorum recently told  CNN it\u2019s important, as a member of Congress, to \u201cfight to make sure you get your fair share.\u201d  Santorum helped secure at least $1 billion in earmarks for Pennsylvania while in Congress, according to the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense. On Thursday, Gingrich and Santorum \u2013 who rode a late surge to a close second-place finish in Iowa \u2013 sniped at each other\u2019s conservative credentials and congressional records. Gingrich also knocked Santorum\u2019s role in Congress, suggesting he was a lesser player in the 1990s Republican revolution in Washington. \u201cHe clearly, in historical experience, would have been the junior partner,\u201d the former House speaker said, reminding voters of his own role in the 1994 Contract With America. Santorum, in turn, noted his role in the \u201cGang of Seven,\u201d a group of freshman GOP lawmakers who exposed a scandal at the House bank in the early 1990s, before Gingrich became speaker. \u201cI was no junior partner in that,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cNewt was not involved in that revolution when it came to the corruption and the scandals. He sat on the sidelines.\u201d Romney, meanwhile, faced a fresh round of conservative criticism when a newspaper resurrected claims that the former Massachusetts governor helped pave the way for President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reforms. \u201cGingrich\u2019s record of conservative accomplishment is unparalleled and his beliefs and vision are passionate and clear,\u201d wrote Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader. Romney, in contrast, was \u201cgovernor of the most liberal state in the country and managed to beat Obama at delivering Obamacare.\u201d Conservatives must rally around the former House speaker \u201cor face the very real prospect of having Barack Obama walk all over\u201d Romney, McQuaid said. Huntsman, who has focused almost exclusively on New Hampshire for months, won the endorsement Thursday of the Boston Globe, a hometown paper for Romney that has often had a contentious relationship with the former Bay State governor. \u201cWhile Romney proceeds cautiously, strategically, trying to appease enough constituencies to get himself the nomination, Huntsman has been bold,\u201d the Globe\u2019s editorial said.  \u201cRather than merely sketch out policies, he articulates goals and ideals. The priorities he would set for the country, from leading the world in renewable energy to retooling education and immigration policies to help American high-tech industries, are farsighted.\u201d Asked about his lackluster 1% polling draw in South Carolina, Huntsman told CNN that that need not prove fatal. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to beat market expectations\u201d in order to gain momentum and raise money. Romney senior strategist Eric Fehrnstrom brushed off the Globe\u2019s endorsement, noting that \u201cBoston is a two-newspaper town, and the Globe has a liberal editorial page.\u201d  Fehrnstrom touted Romney\u2019s endorsement by the smaller Boston Herald, which generally has a more conservative outlook. Gingrich tried to distinguish himself from Romney Thursday by telling supporters in Plymouth, New Hampshire, that \u201cthere is a very big difference in our two sets of values. I don\u2019t believe a Massachusetts moderate is in a very good position to debate Barack Obama, and I think it would be very hard to win the general election because I think it just blurs everything.\u201d Romney himself tried to keep the focus on Obama, blasting the president Thursday for appointing \u201clabor stooges\u201d to the National Labor Relations Board \u2013 which Republicans have accused of having a pro-union bias. Obama recently placed three new members \u2013 two Democrats and a Republican \u2013 on the panel while circumventing the Senate confirmation process, citing a right to do so through recess appointments while the Senate is not in session. \u201cThis president has engaged and is engaging in crony capitalism,\u201d Romney asserted during a New Hampshire town hall meeting.  \u201cIt is happening with the National Labor Relations Board, where he is paying back big unions that helped his campaign.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alan Silverleib and Dana Bash contributed to this report",

Jon Huntsman Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum spar over congressional records New Hampshire's most influential paper urges voters to back Newt Gingrich Mitt Romney accuses President Obama of \"crony capitalism\" With GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney feeling comfortable enough to campaign in South Carolina, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum on Thursday scoured New Hampshire for votes and hammered away at each other\u2019s congressional record. Gingrich, who got a boost from the state\u2019s top newspaper, knocked Santorum\u2019s role in Congress, suggesting the former Pennsylvania senator was a \u201cjunior partner\u201d in the 1990s Republican revolution in Washington. \u201cHe clearly in historical experience would have been the junior partner,\u201d Gingrich said, reminding voters which Republican was really behind the Contract With America.

S.C. tea party not happy with Romney Occupy protesters at Santorum event Mitt Romney: In his own words Ron Paul defends Huntsman tweet Obama recently placed three new members on the panel while circumventing the Senate confirmation process, citing a right to do so through recess appointments while the Senate is not in session. \u201cThis president has engaged and is engaging in crony capitalism,\u201d Romney asserted during a New Hampshire town hall meeting with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. \u201cIt is happening with the National Labor Relations Board, where he is paying back big unions that helped his campaign.\u201d McCain endorsed Romney on Wednesday, one day after the latter\u2019s razor-thin victory in the Iowa caucuses. Romney waged a tough primary campaign in 2008 against McCain, the party\u2019s eventual presidential nominee that year. McCain traveled Thursday with Romney to Charleston, South Carolina. The senator attacked Santorum\u2019s record of securing earmarks. \u201cEarmark spending is the gateway to corruption, and that was practiced when Republicans were in the majority,\u201d McCain said, flanked by Romney and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Romney\u2019s leading backer in the Palmetto State. Santorum has come under fire from his GOP foes for his unapologetic defense of the earmarking process, which he says is simply a power granted to Congress under the Constitution. Santorum will officially purchase a major ad buy in South Carolina on Friday, CNN has learned. The former senator tangled with proponents of same-sex marriage at a convention of college Republicans in Concord, New Hampshire. \u201cAre we saying everybody has the right to marry?\u201d Santorum asked the crowd. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d shouted several members in the crowd. Santorum later equated same sex marriage with polygamy. Huntsman, meanwhile, touted poll results showing he is running ahead of Gingrich in the state and predicted his decision to skip Iowa and focus on New Hampshire would pay off. \u201cWe\u2019re doing to do well. We\u2019re going to exceed market expectations,\u201d the candidate told CNN\u2019s \u201cJohn King, USA.\u201d Huntsman earlier said Santorum\u2019s emphasis on grass-roots campaigning in Iowa led to him coming within a hair\u2019s breadth of beating Romney, and Huntsman\u2019s efforts would produce similar results. What is Santorum\u2019s path forward? For his part, Santorum is trying to capitalize on the momentum from his late surge in Iowa, where he came within eight votes of beating Romney. But his sudden visibility has put him in the crosshairs of his opponents and led to more scrutiny from reporters. The heads of both the NAACP and the National Urban League blasted Santorum this week after he was reported to have told an Iowa audience, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make black people\u2019s lives better by giving them someone\u2019s money. I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn the money.\u201d The officials said Santorum was \u201csingling out\u201d African-Americans as poor. Santorum said Wednesday that he didn\u2019t recall saying \u201cblack,\u201d telling CNN\u2019s \u201cJohn King USA\u201d that \u201cIt was probably a tongue-tied moment as opposed to something that was deliberate.\u201d \u201cI started to say a word and sort of mumbled it and changed my thought. I don\u2019t recall saying black. No one in that audience heard me say that,\u201d he said. Texas Rep. Ron Paul, meanwhile, used his close third-place showing in Iowa as fuel for his libertarian anti-establishment message, while Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would press on to \u201cplaces where they have actual primaries\u201d after his fifth-place finish Tuesday night. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota dropped out Wednesday after coming sixth in Iowa. Next Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary appears to be Romney\u2019s to lose. Romney benefits from a virtual favorite-son status there, not to mention a significant advantage in terms of campaign cash and organization. He is far ahead in most recent statewide polling and can now boast of a first-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, albeit by a razor-thin margin. Gergen: Could mystery GOP candidate still emerge? Meanwhile, after taking a night to rethink his campaign, Perry announced to supporters via Twitter that he would stay in despite his 10% showing in Iowa. He told reporters later that he would take part in two debates in New Hampshire and campaign in South Carolina, which holds the first Southern primary January 21. Of the 25 pledged delegates at stake in Iowa, CNN has estimated that Romney, Santorum and Paul will each win seven, with Gingrich and Perry picking up two apiece. It will take 1,144 delegates to capture the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, this summer.

Follow her on Twitter @ananavarro. By Ana Navarro, CNN Contributor (CNN) \u2013 The Veepstakes guessing game is over. In the red corner, we have Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, America\u2019s \u201ccomeback team.\u201d In the blue corner, we have Barack Obama and Joe Biden, America\u2019s current team. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble. Now that we know who the players are, the race is on to define Paul Ryan. Winning the contest of turning him into either a villain or hero could determine the election in several states, none more important than Florida, the big kid on the swing-state block. Paul Ryan has great potential, the potential to be an asset or a liability to the Republican ticket. How he affects the election in Florida depends primarily on two voting groups, seniors and Hispanics. We just don\u2019t know how he will play with those two groups. Polls show that most Americans don\u2019t know much about Rep. Paul Ryan. Political junkies either love or hate the Ryan Plan, but average Americans are more likely to be conversant on the latest contestants on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d than on the intricacies of Ryan\u2019s budget proposal. There will be a Medicare battle waged in Florida, a state with one of the biggest senior populations in the country. Democrats will say Ryan will end Medicare as we know it. Republicans will say he is a courageous leader who offers a responsible solution to the inevitable bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security. I live in Florida and have seen this movie before. It usually involves scary robo-calls and political mailers targeting seniors. While in Florida, he should also do Hispanic outreach. Latinos don\u2019t know Ryan from Ad\u00e1n. Given the standing of the Republican brand with Latinos, that may be a good thing. Not being known is better than being disliked. Soon after Ryan was named, my inbox filled up with e-mails about his vote against the Dream Act, which would allow undocumented young people brought here as children to become legal under certain circumstances. This is a popular and emotion-laden measure among Latinos. Ryan had also been an opponent of the U.S. embargo against Cuba. This is a heresy for a dependable voting block of Cuban-American Republicans. Yikes! Read Ana Navarro\u2019s full column",

            "article_content": "A fair number of political moments in 2012 ranged from ridiculous to inexplicable But in an election year, the top stories are the obvious ones Some of the top stories were small pieces in what determined the 2012 election Others were those that portend what might happen down the road Picking the top 10 moments of an election year is like finding your favorite grain of sand on the beach \u2013 there is an impossible number of possibilities. Take catchphrases that became boomerangs \u2013 President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Or GOP challenger Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cI like being able to fire people who provide services to me.\u201d Or when cast members stole the spotlight: Sandra Fluke\u2019s telling House Democrats that \u201cI\u2019m an American woman who uses contraception. Let\u2019s start there.\u201d Or Romney\u2019s top adviser Eric Fehrnstrom telling CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.\u201d And a fair number of moments ranging from ridiculous to inexplicable: Clint Eastwood challenging an empty chair at the Republican National Convention: \u201cI\u2019m not going to shut up, it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Or Obama trying make \u201cRomnesia\u201d a buzzword. Or Romney attempting to do the same with \u201cObamaloney.\u201d So many moments; so much nonsense. But there were game-changers, too \u2013 moments that shook up the race, made history and made our Top 10 list. 10. Wisconsin recall vote The wild ride to Election Day Top ten political moments of 2012 Media's 2012 report card It was seen at the time as a proxy race for November. Wisconsin\u2019s Republican Gov. Scott Walker was in a showdown with organized labor over budget cuts and collective bargaining power. Turns out the end result was no bellwether for the presidential election. Walker won, the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. 9. Chris Christie\u2019s praise for Obama Republican Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s full-on embrace of Obama for helping Superstorm Sandy-ravaged New Jersey came days before the election and had no noticeable effect on the presidential race. But some Republicans think Christie didn\u2019t have to be that effusive. And they\u2019ll remember if his name pops up in 2016. 8. \u2018Legitimate rape\u2019 From the \u201cSay what?\u201d category comes a combo team \u2013 Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock of Indiana. Akin in an interview cited some questionable biology: \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\u201d Mourdock cited a higher power: \u201cLife is that gift from God. I think that even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something God intended to happen.\u201d Republican dreams to take control of the Senate dwindled throughout the year, but Akin and Murdock, who both lost, pretty much shut that door in a couple of sentences. 7. Self-deportation Two words from Mitt Romney during the primary reverberated all the way through to November \u2013 the issue was his plan to keep employers from hiring undocumented workers: \u201cPeople who have come here illegally won\u2019t be able to find work. And over time, those people would tend to leave the country, or self-deport,\u201d he said during a debate in Florida. The concept of self-deportation by undocumented workers was not by itself responsible for Romney\u2019s dismal showing among Hispanics, but it surely greased the skids. 6. The \u201947 percent\u2019 Also in the category of moments for which you could get a mulligan, there was Romney secretly taped at a Boca Raton, Florida, fundraiser saying, \u201cThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims.\u201d Romney later called his remarks completely wrong. They also caused the deepest self-inflicted wound of the election. 5. Romney picks Ryan as running mate On the flip side, Romney\u2019s VP day may well have been the best moment of his campaign \u2013 the selection of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan excited conservatives in a way Romney himself had not. 4. Obama blows first debate How many moments are there in an hour and a half? The president lost all of them in the first debate. The pictures tell the story of a man who phoned it in, panicking his supporters and providing an opening for Romney. 3. Supreme Court upholds Obamacare A Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 if that doesn\u2019t strike you as political, consider what would have happened on the campaign trail if the high court had struck down the president\u2019s signature first-term achievement. 2. Obama endorses same-sex marriage The first president to endorse same sex-marriage was a daily double moment: good politics aimed at an activist wing of his party base, and most certainly history. 1. Obama wins re-election The number one political moment of the year is easy during elections. For auld lang syne, cue the confetti and say goodbye to 2012 and all its moments \u2013 historical \u2026 and hysterical.",

            "article_content": "NEW: House Speaker John Boehner says a needed conversation is underway Many questions reverberate among Republicans after the electoral thumping Conservatives say Mitt Romney was too moderate; Superstorm Sandy also blamed Others say the party must adjust to changing demographics Was it the wrong candidate, low voter turnout, a few dumb comments, a superstorm or falling out of touch with a shifting American demographic? Listening to Republicans try to explain what went wrong in their worse-than-expected election thumping reveals a party struggling to define itself amid continuing change in the nation it seeks to lead. \u201cWe have to allow for a period when it\u2019s going to be messy and in which there\u2019s going to be an attempt for the Republican Party to find its soul,\u201d noted Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s a divided party, it seems to me right now.\u201d The well-known division pits a loud and powerful conservative base, fueled in the past three years by the tea party movement, against a once-prevalent moderate faction now relegated to wing status. Evidence of the competing camps includes several U.S. Senate races in which little-known tea party-backed candidates toppled veteran moderates in Republican primary races, then lost to Democrats in the general election. That dynamic in 2010 and this year \u2013 which brought political punch lines such as Christine O\u2019Donnell and Richard Mourdock to the national debate \u2013 cost Republicans any chance of toppling Democrats from their Senate majority. Tuesday\u2019s election revealed a broader challenge for GOP leaders and strategists. The white vote that is the party\u2019s traditional electoral foundation dropped to 72% of the turnout \u2013 its lowest level ever \u2013 while the Latino vote that tilts strongly toward Democrats rose to double digits for the first time at 10%, according to exit polls. Hutchison: Tea Party muddled message GOP faces changing demographics The political path forward for GOP Minority turnout a curveball for GOP Even more problematic for Republicans was that President Barack Obama won 55% of the women\u2019s vote, which comprised 53% of the overall count, the exit polls indicated, while GOP challenger Mitt Romney won 52% of the male vote. That meant an advantage for Obama of more than 7 million in the women\u2019s vote, and more than 5.5 million when comparing the president\u2019s share of the women\u2019s vote with Romney\u2019s share of the men\u2019s vote. Overall, Obama beat Romney by just over 2 million votes. To win the Republican primary, Romney had to adopt conservative stances on sensitive social issues \u2013 such as opposing gay marriage, abortion and a pathway to legal status for many young undocumented immigrants \u2013 which alienated increasingly significant demographics of the American electorate, analysts noted. The former governor of moderate Massachusetts tried to move back to the political center in the final month of the campaign, but questions persisted about Republican stances on social issues. \u201cLatinos were disillusioned with Barack Obama, but they are absolutely terrified by the idea of Mitt Romney,\u201d GOP fundraiser Ana Navarro told CNN. GOP strategist Lenny McAllister said Thursday that the problem involved both substance and style. \u201cI think that when it comes to our principles, when it comes to the economy, when it comes to education and some of the things that we want to offer the American people, the Republican Party and our conservative principles have something to offer Latinos and African-Americans,\u201d McAllister told CNN. \u201cBut when you\u2019re talking about electrified fences and you\u2019re talking about voter suppression, you\u2019re not going to win any voters within those two groups,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason why we need leaders within the conservative movement and the Republican Party that can articulate the values without going down that very dangerous and insulting path that we saw throughout 2012.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, the de facto leader of the party in the election\u2019s aftermath, acknowledged Friday that a necessary internal discussion had started. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that as a political party we\u2019ve got some work to do,\u201d Boehner told reporters, adding that \u201cthe principles of our party are sound\u201d but the question is \u201chow we talk about who we are as a party.\u201d For now, \u201cconversations are under way and will continue,\u201d Boehner said. That message seemed lost on many conservatives, at least in their initial reactions. Some blamed the Romney loss on Superstorm Sandy, which slammed the East Coast from Maryland to Connecticut to disrupt campaigning the week before the election. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN the storm and its aftermath halted Romney\u2019s momentum. At a news conference Wednesday, a coalition of social conservatives and tea party activists said Romney\u2019s campaign failed to represent them on a national level. \u201cConservatives were left out in the cold,\u201d complained Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cIt should have been a landslide for Romney, had he embraced a truly conservative agenda.\u201d In a campaign defined by bitter attacks on both sides, Bozell faulted Romney for not being even more aggressive, saying, \u201cIt should have been a cakewalk for Romney to define (the president), but he didn\u2019t \u2013 hence Obama\u2019s victory.\u201d Meanwhile, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List criticized Romney for failing to make abortion a central campaign issue. Stronger attacks on the administration\u2019s policies, such as a requirement that religious organizations provide their employees with health care coverage that she said included abortion-inducing drugs, would have attracted more support from uncommitted voters, Dannenfelser argued. \u201cHe took all the right stances,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem was not communicating on the national stage with Obama what (the president\u2019s) actual positions were.\u201d Her group endorsed Romney, Dannenfelser said, adding, \u201cWe assumed that given who he was, he would make (abortion) more of a national issue.\u201d According to exit polls, 59% of voters think abortion should be legal in the United States, compared with 36% who said it should be illegal. Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, pinned the election loss on \u201ca weak, moderate candidate, hand-picked by the Beltway elites and country club establishment wing of the Republican Party.\u201d Her claim elicited a vulgarity from retiring Rep. Steve LaTourette, a moderate Republican who told CNN on Thursday: \u201cThere\u2019s a one-word phrase we use in Ohio for that: crap.\u201d LaTourette says the hyper-partisan environment in Washington politics prompted him not to run for a 10th term this year. He attributed his party\u2019s election failure on far-right viewpoints on social issues, saying the GOP needs to \u201cget out of peoples\u2019 lives, get out of their bedrooms.\u201d \u201cWe sent (women) running back to the Democratic Party because they think we\u2019re nutty,\u201d LaTourette said of comments about rape by Mourdock of Indiana and Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, conservatives who both lost Senate races Tuesday in states won by Romney. Mourdock came under criticism for saying it was God\u2019s will when a child is conceived by rape, while Akin was forced to apologize and declare as wrong his statement that \u201clegitimate\u201d rape rarely causes pregnancy. Another retiring Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, also cited the comments by Mourdock and Akin as detrimental. \u201cWe had Republican candidates who got very high profile and said some very stupid things. I think that really tainted the party,\u201d Hutchison told CNN on Thursday, adding: \u201cPeople have personal beliefs, and what we need to do is fashion a party around the economics and the long-term viability of the economy of our country. When people start trying to go into such personal issues and then try to form a party around it, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d To McAllister, the GOP strategist, it comes down to Republicans needing to get better at communicating their core principles. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to articulate the conservative Republican message without being insulting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that, moving forward, you\u2019ll see some leaders be able to do that extremely well. And you\u2019ll continue to see others that slip when it comes to this.\u201d Other Republicans said the party needs to broaden its base by becoming more inclusive to minorities. \u201cThe question is do they want to, in a disciplined way, create a schedule and a program and include people who are not traditionally Republican,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who lost to Romney in the GOP primary race this year. Hutchison called Texas a possible model for the party, noting it permits some children of illegal immigrants to attend state universities and that her successor in the Senate will be Ted Cruz, whose family came from Cuba. \u201cI think Texas is a way forward to show you can be very conservative and talk about the issues that Hispanics \u2026 embrace,\u201d she said. While losing the presidential race and failing to win a Senate majority, Republicans held on to their control of the U.S. House, setting up a repeat of the political breakdown in Washington of the past two years. Some Republicans say the gridlock of the 112th Congress, which concludes at the end of the year, may give way to a new sense of cooperation in the session that starts in January, motivated by a political survival instinct if nothing else. \u201cI think, finally, everybody will start working together, because over the last three terms, we\u2019ve seen everybody be humiliated and be humbled a little bit,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cIn 2008, it was the Republicans. In 2010, it was the Democrats. In 2012, it\u2019s been the tea party element. So, everybody has finally been humbled to a point where they have to come to the table and start working for Americans, not just for their own political interest.\u201d Sawhill, the Brookings fellow, said she expected moderate elements of traditional Republican support \u2013 such as the business community \u2013 to pressure party leaders to work with Democrats on solutions to vexing problems such as a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits and debts. Citing the \u201cpublic disenchantment with the way Washington is working, she told a post-election forum Wednesday that Republicans \u201chave to work a little harder to make sure there is more compromise in the future.\u201d The initials signs were mixed. Boehner expressed a desire to work out a deal with Obama and Democrats during the week and at a news conference on Friday. However, he stuck to the hard-line Republican position of no tax increases as part of a package including spending cuts and entitlement reforms. \u201cRaising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want,\u201d Boehner said Friday, noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners. But he also said that \u201ceverything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at.\u201d Earlier this week, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the Democratic plan to let tax cuts from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration expire for income over $250,000 would be rejected by congressional Republicans. \u201cNow is the time for the president to propose solutions that actually have a chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and a closely divided Senate,\u201d McConnell said in a prepared statement. His Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said the election results show the public backs the Democratic position that was a staple of Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cThere was a message sent to us by the American people, based on the campaign,\u201d Reid said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cPeople making all this money have to contribute a little bit more.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Peter Hamby, Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

Three states will put gay/lesbian marriages to a popular vote for the first time The votes could indicate shifting public opinion on same-sex marriage Pro-gay/lesbian marriage donors include NYC Mayor Bloomberg and ex-NFL chief Tagliabue From her Baltimore kitchen, Rebecca Murphy is lobbying legislators, crafting signs and making phone calls as she wages a battle to allow gays and lesbians to marry in her state. The married mother of two doesn\u2019t have a personal stake in the fight. Rather, Murphy represents the growing number of people nationwide who support gay rights regardless of their own sexual orientation. \u201cI have gay and lesbian friends and family who are raising children and creating lives, and they deserve to be treated fairly,\u201d she says. As national polls show a shift in attitudes about same-sex marriage, Murphy\u2019s state of Maryland is one of three poised to put the issue to an up-or-down popular vote for the first time next month. Same-sex marriage and the election Author: Morals matter to my two moms Boy, 10, talks same-sex marriage speech Law expert: DOMA won't last forever While support has grown, there are still many who oppose allowing gays to marry and are doing their part to strike the measure down. The Rev. Frank Reid and his wife, Marlaa, of Bethel AME Church in Baltimore run workshops for single African-Americans in an effort to encourage strong marriages and discourage sexual behaviors that can lead to HIV/AIDS. \u201cI do understand and accept that there are other patterns for families,\u201d Marlaa Reid says. \u201cHowever, the basic prescription for marriage, I embrace it as a biblical prescription. A man and a woman.\u201d Her husband is quick to point out that though the Reids support the traditional view of marriage, it \u201cdoes not mean that we don\u2019t love our gay, lesbian and transgender brothers and sisters.\u201d \u201cIt means that we don\u2019t take our direction from the president, whoever he or she may be. It is a reminder to us that God loves the sinner, but hates the sin,\u201d Frank Reid says. What a difference Voters have mostly agreed with the Reids\u2019 views. Thirty-eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same sex, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. In the six states \u2013 Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York \u2013 and the District of Columbia where gays and lesbians have won marriage rights, it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. But what a difference an election cycle makes. Four years ago, three states \u2013 Arizona, Florida and California \u2013 joined the list of those with constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, while Arkansas banned same-sex couples from adopting. This year, Maryland, Maine and Washington could go the other way. Maine could represent the biggest turnaround. The state rejected their governor\u2019s decision to allow same-sex marriage in 2009, but recent polling suggests a shift. The Pan Atlantic SMS Group of Portland released a poll October 10 saying \u201c55% of Mainers plan to vote in support of same-sex marriage\u201d and another 1.3% are leaning that way, the Press Herald reported. Washington and Maryland, meanwhile, are voting on whether to affirm decisions made by their legislatures and supported by their governors. \u201cThe biggest difference going into this election as opposed to the last election is that a majority of Americans now support the freedom to marry, we have a president of the United States that supports the freedom to marry, we have six states and the District of Columbia where gay people can share in the freedom to marry,\u201d says Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry, a group supporting the right of gays to marry. A CNN/ORC poll in June found that a majority of Americans support marriage rights for gays and lesbians, reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion over the past two decades. The number of Americans who say they have a close friend or family member who is gay or lesbian, meanwhile, has jumped from 49% in 2010 to 60% today, the first time in CNN polling that a majority of Americans have said that. In the 1990s, most Americans said they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. Drew Tagliabue, the executive director of the New York City chapter of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, says ties with gay people have prompted non-gays to support gay rights causes in increasing numbers. \u2026 it\u2019s just a simple matter of equality. Drew Tagliabue, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays \u201cWhen you come at something and you know someone who is gay, it takes the fear out of the issue and makes it clear that it\u2019s just a simple matter of equality,\u201d he says. The November votes come as courts are moving to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, one of the biggest obstacles to gay rights supporters. The divisive act, passed in 1996, bars federal recognition of marriages between people of the same sex and says states cannot be forced to recognize them. Timeline: Same-sex marriage On Thursday, a federal appeals court in New York became the nation\u2019s second to strike down the law, saying that it violates the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. Read the ruling (PDF). A federal appeals court in Boston made a similar ruling in May. The appellate court decisions mean the next step is likely to be a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Related: Federal court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act Courting minority voters In Maryland, gay rights advocates hope minorities will turn out to support the ballot measure \u2013 known as Question 6. Nearly 30% of voters in Maryland are black and 8.4% are Latino. Both communities have shown a surge of support since May, when President Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage. Washington Post-ABC polls taken before and after Obama\u2019s announcement showed an 18-point jump in the number of African-Americans who support same-sex marriage. Also, 52% in a recent Pew Research Center national poll of Latinos said they support same-sex marriage, a significant increase from 2006 when 52% said they opposed it. Partnerships with racial and ethnic minorities became more important to the gay and lesbian community after 2008, when California voters approved a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriages. Voter exit polls showed strong support for the measure by blacks and Latinos. Wolfson, of Freedom to Marry, says that gay rights groups reacted by reaching out more aggressively to minority communities and encouraging gays and lesbians who are minorities to talk to their own friends and families about gay rights. \u201cI think it will be huge if the African-Americans of this state do what I think they\u2019re going to do, which is to recognize that everybody is entitled to equal protection under the law,\u201d says Murphy, who is black. Also supporting allowing gays and lesbians to marry in Maryland is the NAACP, which has put the civil rights group at loggerheads with clergy such as Reid. Reid accuses gay groups of forging convenient ties with black and Latino communities, while doing little to champion other minority causes. \u201cWhere is this money for education to pour out to Latino and African-American communities,\u201d Reid asks. Kevin Nix, a spokesman for Marylanders for Marriage Equality, says the group is focused only on Question 6 right now and not other minority ballot issues like a local version of the Dream Act, which aims to protect undocumented young immigrants from deportation. Derek McCoy, a married father of three from Prince Georges County, has turned his opposition to Question 6 into a full-time job. He sees the ballot measure as a threat to his own personal freedoms. \u201cWe are making a fundamental shift in what society sees as marriage,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we look at it, people are asking to change our religious and civil liberties.\u201d Big money Question 6 has attracted big money from supporters and opponents around the country. A recent Washington Post poll showed the gay community winning the issue by a 9-point margin just days after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $250,000 to Marylanders for Marriage Equality. Hedge fund manager Paul Singer donated the same amount. Former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue lives in the District of Columbia, but he and his family have donated $100,000 to Marylanders for Marriage Equality. In past campaigns to expand marriage rights, little connection was made between dollars spent and outcome, and gay rights organizations were not always leading the way on collecting money from out of state. This time, if gay rights groups aren\u2019t outpacing opponents in raising out-of-state funds, they\u2019re close. Tagliabue, Bloomberg and Singer\u2019s combined donation of $600,000 is nearly as much as the entire budget of their opponents.The National Organization for Marriage, which opposes allowing same-sex marriage, has a $2 million matching grant challenge on its website targeting the November initiatives. The Knights of Columbus, a Roman Catholic organization that opposes same-sex marriage, acknowledged last week that it has spent at least $6 million since 2005 on a variety of initiatives opposing the expansion of marriage rights. In the Maryland race, gay rights groups appear to be leading in fund raising, with $3.2 million to $835,000 for their opponents. According to the Washington Public Disclosure Commission, gay civil rights activists in that state are ahead $10.5 million to $1.8 million. Maine gay rights supporters have $3.35 million to their opponents\u2019 $430,000, according to the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Practices. \u201cThe top goal for the second half of 2012 is to win one of these ballot measures,\u201d Wolfson says. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that we can win the freedom to marry in public opinion. We\u2019ve shown that we can win the freedom to marry in courts. We\u2019ve shown that we can win the freedom to marry in legislatures. \u2026 We\u2019ve shown we can win the freedom to marry with the support of both Republican and Democratic legislatures. The last barrier we have to overcome is to show we can win the freedom to marry in an up-or-down vote on the ballot.\u201d Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney said lowered rates for federal student loans should be extended President Obama is set to focus on student loan rates this week Joined by Sen. Marco Rubio, Romney said his VP selection process is \"just beginning\" Rep. Ron Paul said he will stay in the GOP nomination race even if Romney clinches A day before President Obama is set to make a series of appearances on federal student loan rates, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said Monday that he supports extending lowered rates on a popular federal student loan program for low- and middle-income undergraduates. \u201cWith the number of college graduates who can\u2019t find work or who can only find work well beneath their skill level, I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans,\u201d Romney said before a campaign event in Astor, Pennsylvania.  Asked late last year about the rising cost of higher education, Romney suggested then that market forces would lead some colleges to lower the price of receiving an education in order to compete in attracting cost-conscious students. Romney begins vetting VP candidates Romney attacks Obama on energy, unions Romney\u2019s announcement is the latest salvo in a fierce battle that is developing for the youth vote, a bloc Obama is focusing on this week. Obama will visit the University of North Carolina, the University of Colorado and the University of Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday. The three universities are in states Obama narrowly won in the 2008 election, which are considered battleground states again in 2012, meaning they are expected to be heavily contested by both parties in the general election.  Obama will also appear on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s late night talk show Tuesday to pitch extending the lowered rates. Five years ago, rates for the popular student loan program were lowered to 3.4% from 6.8%. Without an extension, the lowered rates are set to expire on July 1 and return to 6.8%. Amid constant speculation about who his vice presidential pick will be, Romney was joined on the campaign trail Monday by Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a popular figure with the tea party movement. The vice presidential selection process is \u201cjust beginning,\u201d Romney said as he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Rubio, a conservative lawmaker of Cuban descent who hails from a battleground state. Romney also said he was \u201ctaking a look\u201d at Rubio\u2019s recent proposal for a conservative alternative to the DREAM Act, legislation that would grant citizenship to the children of undocumented immigrants who have been brought to the United States illegally as children. In a cable television appearance Monday, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, said he will not step aside even if Romney clinches the GOP nomination by garnering the required 1,144 delegates to the GOP convention. \u201cIf tomorrow, Romney had the absolute number, I would probably continue in a modified way to maximize the number of delegates to go to the convention,\u201d Paul said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d adding that his supporters insist he stay in the race. Paul, who\u2019s making his third bid for president, has failed to win a single contest this cycle and trails in the delegate race with 72 delegates to Romney\u2019s 685, according to CNN estimates. Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, has 138 delegates. In his quest for more delgates, the longtime congressman has been campaigning in states that hold contests Tuesday, especially Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. In addition to those two states, GOP primaries will be held Tuesday in New York, Connecticut and Delaware.  The contests will be the first in the GOP presidential race since former Sen. Rick Santorum ended his presidential bid in the face of long odds, slowing fundraising and another bout of illness for his youngest child, who has a chromosomal disorder. Romney will watch the Tuesday night\u2019s results from New Hampshire, where he scored the first political victory of his 2012 Oval Office bid. A campaign aide said the Granite State is \u201cwhere the campaign kicked off, and we see this Tuesday as when the general (election) will kick off \u2013 so we are going back to where it all started.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul Steinhauser, Jessica Yellin, Rachel Streitfeld, Gabriella Schwarz and Martina Stewart contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Several Republicans accused Democrats of election-year politics Sen. Jon Kyl: Republicans don't oppose reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act He cites \"significant budget restraints\" vs. the effort to expand the legislation Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, accused reporters of \"carrying (Chuck) Schumer's water\" In a series of floor speeches Thursday, a group of mostly Democratic women senators made a high-profile and at times emotional appeal to Republicans to support an expanded Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). In doing so, they suggested Republicans were blocking the bill because it would extend its protections to illegal immigrants as well as gays and lesbians. Many Republicans were furious at that suggestion and accused Democrats of election-year politics by trying to paint Republicans as anti-women. \u201cLet me put this on the table,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. \u201cThis bill includes lesbians and gay men. The bill includes undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse. The bill gives Native American tribes authority to prosecute crimes. In my view these are improvements. Domestic violence is domestic violence.\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the lone Republican to join in the floor speeches, said domestic violence victims in her state are often isolated in rural communities \u201cwhere there is no law enforcement and there is no shelter and there is nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Violence Against Women Act is, I think, a ray of hope for those who service victims of domestic violence and sexual assault within our villages.\u201d \u201cNobody opposes the reauthorization of this legislation,\u201d Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Senate Republican, told CNN. \u201cIf you follow the Judiciary Committee work on it, the questions had to do with the additions that have been made to this bill related to illegal immigrant visas, related to the additional sums of money and grants that would be available and the like. \u201cSo what Republicans are focusing on is how to make a bill that should be reauthorized functional in this day and age of significant budget constraints so we can still accomplish the goals of the legislation,\u201d Kyl continued. \u201cI really resent the implication by some of my Democratic friends that if you\u2019re trying to improve the bill that somehow you are for violence against women. That\u2019s reprehensible.\u201d Asked whether the provisions about undocumented immigrants and gays and lesbians needed to be pulled from the bill, Kyl said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Reasonable people ought to be able to sit down and work these things out.\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, accused reporters of \u201ccarrying Schumer\u2019s water,\u201d when they asked him whether he opposed the bill because it would include illegal immigrants and gays and lesbians. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is the Democrats\u2019 top message strategist in the Senate. Republicans think it was his idea to suddenly put VAWA on the floor, just after high-profile battles over other women\u2019s issues \u2013 like abortion and contraception \u2013 were in the news. \u201cI\u2019m always for the Violence Against Women bill,\u201d said Sessions who voted for a GOP alternative bill that was defeated in the Democratic-majority Judiciary Committee.  But he said every time VAWA is up for reauthorization, \u201cif you don\u2019t agree with everything that\u2019s in it, they just attack you as being anti-women.\u201d Sessions added that he was not aware until Thursday the Democrats bill extended to lesbian, gays and illegal immigrants but he acknowledged voters could misread Republicans\u2019 views on the bill. \u201cI think we should be sensitive to the impressions we cast by our votes and so forth but fundamentally you can\u2019t vote a piece of legislation you don\u2019t think is sound,\u201d Sessions said. One bit of evidence that Democrats were, in fact, trying to use the issue for their political advantage was a fundraising appeal e-mailed to supporters by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cToday we\u2019re seeing another stunning GOP attack on women\u2019s rights,\u201d exclaimed the appeal which asked for donations of $5 or more for the committee\u2019s \u201cProtect our Women\u2019s Rights Fund.\u201d In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash Wednesday about the recent fight over contraceptives, Murkowski warned her party is in danger of angering women voters. \u201cI think my party is in an unfortunate place right now, as viewed by many, many women in this country who are feeling anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women\u2019s health,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "This is the last in an occasional series on issues of race, identity and politics ahead of Election Day, including a look at the optics of politics, a white Southern Democrat fighting for survival and how parallels to the past haunt the age of Obama. By Jen Christensen, CNN San Francisco (CNN) \u2013 To call the Rev. Amos C. Brown a veteran of the civil rights movement is an understatement. He was just 15 when he met the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in San Francisco after being driven cross-country by Mississippi activist Medgar Evers. He was one of eight students handpicked to take the only college class King ever taught. He and King were arrested during a lunch-counter sit-in at a nearby downtown Atlanta department store. He also was one of the famed Freedom Riders who blazed a trail through the Deep South. At 71 and slowed by a stroke, Brown could be satisfied as senior pastor to his 3,000-strong flock at Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, the Bay Area\u2019s version of King\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Instead, he has been working behind the scenes \u2013 praying with President Barack Obama before his second debate \u2013 as well as working on the front lines, trying to register as many African-Americans as possible ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. His goal: to strengthen his community\u2019s political voice, fight against what he perceives as efforts to diminish that voice and keep the country\u2019s first black president in office. \u201cMy mentor (Evers) died trying to get people the vote \u2013 a right that was theirs. We\u2019ve got to remember this,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople must know how many others were sacrificed trying to get people this right.\u201d Walking \u2018the line\u2019 It\u2019s a warm mid-October day when Brown and two volunteers from his church head out to the San Francisco County Jail and a Fillmore District barbershop to make personal appeals to register voters. First stop is the jail, where Brown gingerly makes his way up the building\u2019s steps and is met by Susan Fahey, a representative from the sheriff\u2019s office. She reminds the group not to bring in cell phones or purses. \u201cAnd watch your black pens,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will try to take them.\u201d Brown\u2019s group is here as part of \u201cThis Is My Vote,\u201d a national project of major African-American Baptist conventions and the NAACP, where he\u2019s on the board of directors. The NAACP started the campaign after several states passed laws the organization fears will disenfranchise millions of American voters, including the elimination of Sunday voting, voter ID requirements and bans on allowing ex-felons to vote. The Rev. Amos Brown\u2019s office is crowded with awards and multiple boxes of research. After going through extensive security, Brown\u2019s small group meets with Nick Gregoratos, a lawyer whose passion is registering prisoners. Together, under close supervision, they enter \u201cthe line,\u201d the main hallway of this 1960s-era facility. Narrow cells are on each side. As they enter, dozens of young men in orange sweat suits, many of whom had been sleeping, get up and move to the front of their cells. They stand, curious, watching closely from behind thick gray bars. Brown goes up to each cell and talks with the men. Many recognize and greet him warmly. \u201cDr. Brown,\u201d they call out. \u201cOver here, come over here.\u201d When they get to the first cell, Gregoratos shouts out the rules, which are complicated for those doing time in California. But many of the jail\u2019s prisoners are eligible to vote. \u201cNow remember, you can\u2019t use the jail as your address. Use where you last lived or if you were homeless, list the closest intersection,\u201d he tells an inmate filling out a form. He explains how the inmates will get an opportunity to vote on their interests. \u201cThree ballot issues you\u2019ll care about: three strikes, the death penalty and affordable housing,\u201d Gregoratos says. California Proposition 36 would revise the three strikes law to impose a life sentence only if the third crime is \u201cserious or violent.\u201d It would also allow lifers to be re-sentenced if their third crime wasn\u2019t \u201cserious or violent.\u201d State Proposition 34 would eliminate the death penalty as a sentencing option. San Francisco\u2019s Proposition C would create a trust fund to create more affordable housing in one of the most expensive markets in the country. \u201cSee,\u201d Brown says, \u201cit is in your best interest to vote.\u201d Mae B. Winn, one of Brown\u2019s volunteers, talks with many of the men. On these visits she finds herself preaching the Gospel more than talking about registering people to vote. \u201cBut I always find a way to bring it back around,\u201d Winn says. \u201cIt\u2019s that important.\u201d She closes a conversation with a young man by saying, \u201cYou may not have much, but you do have a right to vote in this country that can\u2019t be taken away.\u201d As Brown watches one young man with a small tattoo on his cheek\u00a0fill out a registration form, another prisoner calls out to him. He explains that his grandfather is a member of Brown\u2019s congregation. \u201cWe knew each other back in Jackson,\u201d Brown says to one of his volunteers, referring to the man\u2019s grandfather. \u201cThis is much too small a world.\u201d After their chat, the man fills out a voter registration form. Brown then steps back and quietly surveys all the men crowded up against the bars. \u201cThere is so much wasted talent here,\u201d he says. Brown and his volunteers manage to register about 30 men, some for the first time. \u201cNo one ever asked me before,\u201d inmate Sherard King says. \u201cI\u2019m glad they took the time.\u201d \u2018Katy Perry \u2026 doesn\u2019t do it\u2019 The 2008 election marked the first time young black voters had the highest voter turnout rate among racial groups, according to census figures. Some 55.4% of registered African-Americans age 18-24 voted. For those ages 25-44, the figure was higher: 64% . In comparison, 49.4% of registered whites age 18-24 and 62.1% of those age 25-44 voted. For Asians, 40.6% between 18 and 24 voted; for Hispanics, that number was 38.8%. Brown wants to build on those figures. From memory, he rattles off the numbers of unregistered voting-age African-Americans the way some men rattle off baseball players\u2019 batting averages: \u201c495,658 in Georgia; in New York, 395,170; in Florida, 406,806; and in my own state, here in California, 208,235,\u201d Brown says, quoting figures generated by the NAACP\u2019s analysis of census figures. The Rev. Amos Brown is known for his ability to bring people to their feet with his dynamic preaching. Brown and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. shared the same speech teacher. Though Brown has personal tragedy to remind him how crucial the vote is for his community \u2013 Evers was assassinated in 1963, five years before King\u2019s death \u2013 he knows that young people today don\u2019t have the same experiences shaping their perspective. So he tries to reach out to them personally. He and some of his church\u2019s volunteers make regular rounds to register and encourage the community to vote. Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie, who wrote her dissertation on the effectiveness of voter registration and mobilization drives, says personal appeals such as this are key. \u201cHaving Katy Perry record a robocall, as one campaign did, doesn\u2019t do it,\u201d she says. \u201cStudies show that having someone who is a friend make a personal appeal \u2013 or even someone pretending to be your friend or who comes across as nice \u2013 that is what turns people out to vote.\u201d Photo ops and promises As Brown leaves the jail, a young woman stops him on the building\u2019s steps. \u201cYou preached at my grandfather\u2019s funeral service last year,\u201d the woman says as she shakes his hand and smiles. She asks for his help. Brown listens closely as she describes a family problem. He promises to follow up. Before she leaves, he reminds her to vote, and she agrees. A sheriff\u2019s officer overhears the exchange and notes, \u201cDr. Brown truly is the conscious of our community.\u201d Brown walks down one more step before another young woman stops him. This one asks to have her photo taken with him. As her friend pulls out an iPhone, Brown reminds them about the election. They promise to vote and snap a picture. As he heads to the parking lot, Brown is running a few minutes behind for his next appointment. \u201cIt is a small burden of service,\u201d he says, preoccupied with his mission. \u201cI hope people realize they can be heard if they vote.\u201d Wherever Brown goes, it is like this. Another young man stops him in the parking lot. He lets Brown know he\u2019s been convicted of a crime. He\u2019s upset. He complains his jury was not diverse. \u201cJurors are picked from the voter rolls,\u201d Brown reminds him. \u201cIf people want a jury of their peers, they\u2019re going to need to vote.\u201d Brown promises to come to the young man\u2019s sentencing. Praying with the president A year before his death, King spoke of \u201cthe fierce urgency of now.\u201d \u201cIn this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late,\u201d King said. \u201cWe must move past indecision to action.\u201d Brown says he was reminded of those words when he and another civil rights veteran, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, were asked to provide spiritual counsel on a conference call with the president before his second debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney last month. \u201cWe prayed with the president and gave him encouragement,\u201d Brown says, not wanting to give away too many details. \u201cI did tell him to be brave, to be bold.\u201d Bold and brave action has marked Brown\u2019s life, and the neighborhood around his church is filled with concrete reminders of his efforts to empower a community. Outside Third Baptist, he points to where the church runs its soup kitchen. In the last few years, its line has snaked around the block. Down the street, he points to the low-income and senior housing his church built. The structure is at capacity. Then there\u2019s the mission his church established to help nearly 3,000 refugees. There\u2019s also\u00a0the AIDS outreach the church started long before people knew what to call the disease. There are also signs here that the broader community is grateful for the work. The city has put up banners to honor the church\u2019s 160th anniversary. There is a colorful mural depicting African-American leaders, Brown\u2019s face among the images. Not too far away sits the City Hall complex. It\u2019s where Mayor Willie Brown made the pastor a city supervisor in 1996, and it\u2019s where the mission he\u2019s on today started more than 50 years ago. \u201cThat\u2019s where I first met Dr. King,\u201d Brown says. \u201cMedgar Evers drove me across the country in his \u201955 Olds to an NAACP meeting. I was a youth leader representing Mississippi back then. That\u2019s where this all started back in 1956.\u201d He worked with Evers, the NAACP field secretary for their home state of Mississippi, on a secret voter registration drive. They drove all over the state. The work was so dangerous they often disguised themselves as sharecroppers so they wouldn\u2019t be noticed. Brown was just 15, he says, when he first got into the civil rights movement. Since then, he has spent a lifetime trying to create a more just world. This passion put Brown on a first-name basis with almost everyone mentioned in civil rights history books \u2013 from King, Lowery and Evers to Rosa Parks and Julian Bond. Brown was handpicked to take King\u2019s class at Morehouse College in Atlanta. Soon after, he and King were arrested together when they staged a lunch counter sit-in at Rich\u2019s department store with some of Brown\u2019s fellow students and other civil rights activists. In 1961, Brown became one of the famed Freedom Riders, an interracial group of college students who rode interstate buses through the segregated South and faced attacks and imprisonment. With a recommendation from King, Brown studied at the civil rights leader\u2019s alma mater, Crozer Theological Seminary near Philadelphia. In 1976 he landed one of the most coveted preaching jobs in the country, taking over as senior pastor at Third Baptist. The congregation is considered so politically important that former President Bill Clinton spoke at the church\u2019s 150th anniversary. Photos of Brown with Clinton, President Jimmy Carter and Nelson Mandela blanket the walls of his church office. While he is\u00a0a player in the political landscape, the public seems to better accept him as a social critic than as a part of the political establishment. He lost when he ran for a seat on a community college board. He lost when he ran for the San Francisco school board in 1992. He failed to win re-election as a city supervisor in 2000 \u2013 after which one political observer noted: \u201cHe\u2019s a Mr. Outsider, not a Mr. Insider.\u201d The next year, he asked at a post-9/11 memorial service, \u201cAmerica, is there anything you did to set up this climate?\u201d \u2013 prompting Sen. Dianne Feinstein and then-Gov. Gray Davis to walk out, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. In 2008, some black pastors criticized him for opposing Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage. In 2009, he raised eyebrows when he invited his former seminary classmate and President Obama\u2019s former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright of Chicago, to speak at Third Baptist. Even as a youth, the establishment didn\u2019t always like what he had to say. When Brown was in high school he nearly got expelled after giving an interview to the Cleveland Plain Dealer that was critical of segregated schools. He said his school was separate but not equal to the schools around him and his teachers were underpaid. When the senior class voted him its president, his school principal declared the election invalid. When he was elected a second time, his principal abolished the student council. Now one of his biggest political challenges is to make sure his community stays engaged with this year\u2019s election. He\u2019s determined to make sure individuals, rather than super PACs and corporations, have a real voice in this election. \u2018One tough customer\u2019 From the jail, Brown heads to the Chicago Barber Shop II, a two-story business where the minister seems to know everyone. \u201cDo I have a potential voter here?\u201d he asks as he sits in barber Robert Harlin\u2019s chair on the second floor. The Rev. Amos Brown talks politics with his barber and friend, Robert Harlin. As Harlin gives him a trim, he tells Brown that he always votes. \u201cI want to give our president four more years,\u201d Harlin says. \u201cHe needs more time. Isn\u2019t that what we should do, Bean Pole?\u201d Harlin calls out, using a waiting customer\u2019s nickname. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says the man, looking up from what he\u2019s texting. Trimmed-up, Brown makes his way down to the first floor of the shop. An 83-year-old customer notices the minister and explains who Brown is to a young barber, who confesses he has never voted. \u201cI\u2019ve never missed a vote,\u201d the older gentleman says in admonishment. \u201cYou really need to make it a habit.\u201d \u201cDr. Brown, you have a customer here,\u201d the man calls out. Brown is preoccupied with the barber working the next chair over, who gives Brown a dozen excuses. He\u2019s on the road too much, he says. He doesn\u2019t have time. He doesn\u2019t follow the issues. \u201cHe\u2019s one tough customer,\u201d Brown says to a volunteer who waits nearby. After 10 minutes of quiet and calm conversation between the two, Brown tells the barber, \u201cYou really need to think about this.\u201d The barber doesn\u2019t budge, but Brown has faced death over such things. A barber\u2019s resistance doesn\u2019t deter him; instead, it makes him even more determined. \u201cAgain, just think about it,\u201d Brown says, as he gets ready to leave.

            "article_content": "Rick Santorum has a tough challenge translating his momentum into post-Iowa success Santorum likely needs to do well in New Hampshire and finish first in South Carolina The GOP is sharply split between business pragmatists and more rigid social conservatives Romney still has to prove he can win over more than 25% or 30% of GOP voters Congratulations are in order for Rick Santorum.  The former Pennsylvania senator rose from the ranks of the political dead Tuesday night to come within eight votes of a first-place Iowa finish.  Saying he defied expectations could be the biggest understatement of the 2012 election cycle so far. But where does Santorum go from here?  And what does his virtual Iowa tie with frontrunner Mitt Romney say about the state of the Republican Party? The short answer to the first question, according to analysts, is that Santorum probably needs to finish strong in moderate New Hampshire on January 10 and top the field in conservative South Carolina on January 21.  If Santorum can knock the former Massachusetts governor off his stride \u2013 however long the odds \u2013 we could have a more serious nomination fight on our hands. As for the second question, we\u2019re looking at a severely fractured GOP. \u201cThe general electorate is now seeing the stark divisions within the GOP up close and personal,\u201d says Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller.  \u201cLibertarian, social conservative, and fiscal conservative.  Will the real GOP stand up?\u201d McCain endorses Romney Santorum: 'Obamacare' is a game-changer Evangelicals flock to Santorum Gingrich: Romney has limited appeal Santorum explains controversial remarks Exit polls in Iowa showed a party largely split between its more pragmatic, business-oriented base and conservative religious voters that provide the bulk of the party\u2019s grass-roots muscle.  Romney\u2019s the candidate of the establishment, diminished though it may be.  Santorum\u2019s the favorite of religious and tea party conservatives. Specifically, in Iowa Romney ran best among voters most concerned with defeating President Barack Obama in November.  The former venture capitalist was also the favorite among the majority of caucus-goers who said business experience is more important than a government background. For his part, the adamantly anti-abortion Santorum ran best among the Iowa GOP\u2019s powerful born-again and evangelical voters \u2013 nearly 60% of the Iowa electorate.   He also ran strongest among the nearly half of caucus-goers who described themselves as very conservative. Santorum topped the field among the 65% of voters who feel positive about the populist tea party movement. There was also a split along financial lines, with Romney running best among voters making more than $50,000 a year.  Santorum and Texas Rep. Ron Paul did better among voters making less. \u201cUsually Republican races have not fallen along those lines but there\u2019s a real possibility you will see that class divide in the Republican Party, because Mitt Romney is a very strong candidate for the upper middle class Republicans,\u201d political analyst Ron Brownstein told CNN.  \u201cThey relate to him as a manager and business guy.  He\u2019s struggled more with the blue collar components.\u201d Santorum, on the other hand, excels at \u201cboth cultural conservative and economic nationalism aimed directly at those voters. \u201c Santorum feels like Rocky Balboa Can Santorum translate his support into the kind of campaign capable of challenging Romney\u2019s financial and organizational edge? Santorum\u2019s model, according to Northeastern University political scientist Bill Mayer, should probably be similar to Gary Hart\u2019s path in 1984.   Hart didn\u2019t win the Democratic Party\u2019s nod that year, but he used a better-than-expected showing in Iowa to win New Hampshire and create a far more serious contest than most observers expected. But \u201cit\u2019s by no means certain that Santorum will get a bounce out of Iowa,\u201d Mayer warned.   Multiple candidates have won Iowa, only to fall short in New Hampshire, including George W. Bush in 2000, Bob Dole in 1988 and 1996, and Dick Gephardt in 1988. John Edwards finished a close second in Iowa in 2004, but gained virtually no traction in the Granite State. \u201cNew Hampshire is quite conservative on economic issues, but quite liberal on social issues.  It really meets the old stereotype of the traditional Yankee conservative,\u201d Mayer said. Santorum will have far fewer evangelical or hardline conservative voters to depend on in New Hampshire, he stressed. As for bypassing New Hampshire and holding out for South Carolina, momentum \u201ctends to be a short-lived commodity\u201d in nomination fights, Mayer warned.  Iowa will be ancient history by the time January 21 rolls around. Rick Perry\u2019s decision Wednesday to stay in the race and campaign hard in South Carolina also complicates matters for Santorum, who would benefit from a less divided pool of Palmetto State social conservatives. Santorum may actually be auditioning for the vice presidential slot, argued Schiller. Since Santorum \u201ccan\u2019t claim to bring Pennsylvania with him \u2013 he lost his last re-election bid there \u2013 he has decided to consolidate the very social conservative and activist wing of the GOP behind him,\u201d Schiller said.  Santorum\u2019s ability to do so may \u201cshow Romney that if he wants those folks to get out and vote on Election Day (in November), Romney needs Santorum on the ticket. \u201c Schiller also noted that \u201cthe longer Santorum can stay in \u2026 the more he can lay claim to being properly vetted (unlike Sarah Palin) and the more he can start to look like he belongs on the ticket. \u201c Romney, however, still has a few questions of his own that need to be answered.  For all the talk of his frontrunner status, Romney didn\u2019t do much better in Iowa in 2012 than he did in 2008, at least in terms of overall vote share.   The former governor has yet to prove that he can break a national ceiling of between 25% and 30% support among Republicans. There are \u201cstill a lot of Republicans that are less than thrilled with his candidacy,\u201d Mayer said.   Romney\u2019s fear all along has been that some kind of \u201crelatively plausible alternative candidate emerges.  He\u2019s been fortunate that there aren\u2019t a lot of other strong candidates in this field.\u201d But the Iowa caucuses are noted for their low turnout and are \u201cvery heavily weighted toward the types of people that tend to be most skeptical of Romney,\u201d Mayer noted.  Going forward, the most likely Romney skeptics will not comprise nearly as large a share of the GOP electorate, he said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Embed America is a partnership between CNN Radio and CNN iReport. This series tells the story of the 2012 U.S. presidential election through the people most critical to the campaigns: the voters. CNN Radio is traveling across the country to interview iReporters on election issues close to their hearts. These issues were named important by iReporters during Phase 1 of the iReport Debate. Rosebud Sioux reservation is one of many plagued by high incarceration rates Rose Bear Robe: \"I think every family on this reservation has (a family member) in prison\" Tribal leaders \"want to find other solutions to what is actually social dysfunction,\" advocate says Follow CNN Radio's Embed America trip on our map Whoever wins the 2012 U.S. presidential election faces multiple, serious problems in the U.S. prison system. One issue is the soaring prison population and its rising costs; but another is the issue over who makes up that population. The problem in Todd County, South Dakota, is that too many of their young men end up behind bars. \u201cI think every family on this reservation has (a family member) in prison,\u201d Rose Bear Robe, a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning to be normal now, when people used to be ashamed of it.\u201d The Rosebud Sioux reservation occupies all of Todd County on the southern border of South Dakota. It spans hundreds of miles of sweeping grassland spilling into four other counties in the state, and is covered with small canyons and winding creeks. That beauty contrasts with small clusters of homes in need of repair and a community clearly in need of jobs. Bear Robe says the rest of the country, outside the reservation, does not realize the serious problems that exist on tribal lands. Huge numbers of a critical group, men, aged 18-30, are in prison rather than trying to build the community and their families, she said. Read Rose Bear Robe\u2019s original story on CNN iReport \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it,\u201d said the 56-year-old who is raising her 4-year-old grandson because his dad is serving time, \u201cbut the kids really suffer because of their fathers being in prison.\u201d Much evidence of the problem is anecdotal, in part because there is little hard data about Native Americans, including basic information like population size. The Census Bureau groups \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d and \u201cAlaska Native\u201d in one category. The agency\u2019s latest figures, for 2011, estimate that 8.9% of South Dakota\u2019s population is one or the other. Thus, there are no firm numbers for the Native American population by itself, but we know it is, at most, 8.9% of the population in South Dakota. That is significant when compared with data from the state\u2019s Department of Corrections, which reported that Native Americans were a whopping 29% of the adult prison population and 38% of juvenile offenders in 2011. This pattern is not limited to the Mount Rushmore State. \u201cIn states where Native Americans are a significant portion of the state population, we see generally very significant disparity in (incarceration rates),\u201d said Mark Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization which pushes for prison reform in the U.S. \u201cNative Americans tend to be incarcerated at high rates overall.\u201d Watch Embed America\u2019s behind-the-scenes video with Bear Robe This is apparent in data from other states. In Montana, a 2011 report from the Department of Corrections noted, \u201cAlthough American Indians represent about 7 percent of Montana\u2019s total population, they account for about 19 percent of all men in prison and 33 percent of all women in prison.\u201d In Minnesota, the latest Census numbers show a population of 1.3 percent Native American or Alaska Native. But the state Department of Corrections in January reported that 9 percent of inmates were \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d This is a serious concern in the tribal community, both the idea that there is a disparity in prison rates and that the prison rates, in general are too high. \u201cTribal leaders have been raising this concern of the use of over-incarceration,\u201d said John Dossett, general counsel to the National Congress of American Indians. \u201cThey really want to find other solutions to what is actually social dysfunction.\u201d Dossett pointed to wide efforts at finding alternatives to incarceration, saying that too often people are locked up before anyone asks if there is a better solution. At the same time, he said, there are major concerns that Native Americans get more and harsher punishment in what they see as an overly punitive system. This is especially true when they are outside the tribal court system. \u201cTribes and tribal people often feel they\u2019re discriminated against,\u201d Dossett told CNN. He gave an example about sentiments toward state courts: \u201cSomeone will leave the reservation, go to town, get drunk, do something dumb and if a white kid had done it, they\u2019d call their parents and take them home,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if its some strange native kid, they\u2019ll put them in jail.\u201d Dossett and his organization insist that justice systems are different on different reservations and that many people are trying to improve problem areas. But he said it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Looking back at the numbers, why is there this disparity? It\u2019s not objectively clear. While their prison rates sometimes mirror similar state figures for African-Americans, Native Americans make up such a small percentage of the national population (fewer than 2%, according to the Census Bureau) that there are few or no studies that offer an explanation for, or even an estimate of, their overall imprisonment rate. There are complex cultural, economic and societal issues at play. And the situation is complicated by the issue of who prosecutes which crimes in Indian country. On reservations, U.S. law recognizes the authority of tribal court systems for most minor crimes, as long as one Native American is involved. But major crimes on tribal lands, including assault and most felonies, are prosecuted in the federal system. Crimes happening off the reservation often go to state courts. In the federal and state prison systems, Mauer said, there could be higher numbers of Native Americans because there is a higher crime rate on reservations. But he also theorized the disparity may come from an underlying issue in the state and federal justice systems, like racial bias. On the Rosebud Sioux reservation, Bear Robe and others whom CNN spoke with, including a former police officer, are convinced that at least one issue is an overlooked part of the police force culture itself. \u201cThey use the word around here, \u2018target,\u2019\u201d Bear Robe said, her head nodding to punctuate the point. \u201cThey target individuals so the cops will go after them.\u201d See this story on the CNN Radio Soundwaves blog Bear Robe\u2019s son Eric King is serving 20 years after pleading guilty to a 2007 incident on the reservation. He admitted to biting his then-pregnant girlfriend and to assaulting a tribal officer who responded to his girlfriend\u2019s call to police. But Bear Robe charges that a tribal police officer targeted her family and others, and once the officer was on the scene, she insists he brutally attacked her son, not the other way around. Bear Robe visited her son hours later in jail. \u201cWhen I went to go see him, he was all black and blue,\u201d she said slowly, her hand brushing across her forehead and temple to her arm, \u201cThe cop must have been standing on his arm the longest time because it left an imprint on his arm.\u201d Bear Robe said her son also had a black eye, cut lip, many bruises and possibly a broken rib but she was not allowed to take photos or have a doctor visit him. A Tribal Council member who was with Bear Robe at the time confirmed her failed attempts to document her son\u2019s injuries. CNN contacted that police officer by phone. He initially agreed to meet for an interview but later did not return phone calls to set up a meeting time and place. That officer was fired from the police department several years ago and current officials would not comment on why he was fired or whether he may have had a personal issue with Eric King or anyone else he arrested. \u201cPersonal vendettas?\u201d asked Calvin Waln, a former police officer who was fired just a few weeks ago, \u201cThere are certain individuals who do that (in the police force). You see that.\u201d Waln, who goes by the nickname \u201cHawkeye,\u201d insisted that he was asked to leave the Rosebud police force after he began notifying his superiors of what he viewed as cases of police brutality, flagrant civil rights violations and lack of due process. \u201cYou\u2019re talking violations of civil rights, excessive use of force is one,\u201d the somber-looking ex-officer told CNN, continuing his list: \u201cSpraying handcuffed suspects with pepper spray \u2026 physical police brutality where the officers end up injuring or breaking bones themselves from assaulting somebody.\u201d Waln could not show CNN proof to support his accusations nor could he confirm any details of Eric King\u2019s case. In the past four years, the Rosebud Tribal Council, which has semi-autonomous power on the reservation, has fired two police chiefs amid corruption charges. CNN spent two days on the reservation and spoke with then-Acting Chief Edwin Young, who vigorously denied allegations from Waln, Bear Robe and others. Young is from the reservation and started his career as a police officer with the Rosebud police department 16 years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t see the corruption,\u201d he told CNN Radio, \u201cAll it is, is that the public doesn\u2019t have the information that they so desire \u2026 (it\u2019s) just a misunderstanding or misinformation.\u201d When pressed on Eric King\u2019s specific case, Young said that police files prior to two years ago are missing or destroyed. \u201cI have no idea what happened to those files, that was the previous administration, the previous police chief,\u201d he said, \u201cand all those, those are gone now\u2026 somehow they destroyed all the paperwork.\u201d Since that interview, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe reinstated the previous police chief, Grace Her Many Horses, who had been ousted amid corruption allegations. CNN put in requests to speak with her but she did not grant an interview. There are many well-documented underlying factors leading to crime and imprisonment, that minorities have higher poverty rates than whites. The broken trailer windows and cars in disrepair on the Rosebud Sioux reservation give a clue that the lack of an economy is inextricably woven into the culture and society of the area. Consider this statistic from the Census Bureau: Nearly half of the people in Todd County live under the federal poverty line, making it the second-poorest county in the nation. The Department of Interior produces another gut-punching statistic: unemployment among the Rosebud Sioux tribe is over 80%. Sociologists have documented a connection between race and poverty for minorities. And Mauer thinks those economic factors extend to incarceration rates. \u201cA lot of factors go into this,\u201d Mauer said, \u201cBut still we see a lot of very direct racial outcomes even in the theoretically race-neutral court system.\u201d The United States currently leads the world in incarcerations, both in sheer number and in rate. And those numbers have been going up. The number of people in U.S. prisons nearly doubled in the 1990s, according to the Census Bureau. It has continued to go up, though by less sharp of an increase, in the past decade. It\u2019s gone up more than 2\u00bd times in South Dakota in that time. This is not an issue that has come up specifically in the presidential campaign season, though President Barack Obama is well-known in Indian country for pushing through the 2010 Tribal Law and Order Act, which especially adds resources to fight domestic abuse and sexual violence on reservations. CNN asked the campaign of Republican candidate Mitt Romney for any statements, police papers or positions on Native Americans, but press secretary Andrea Saul did not respond on the record. What election issue matters to you? Share your view with CNN iReport. At an average cost for all prisons state and federal, of $30,000 per inmate per year, according to data from the Justice Department, the inmate surge is adding pressure to already tight federal and state budgets. But in places like Rosebud, South Dakota, the costs of incarcerations are even higher. Leaders and residents alike believe the cycle of crime, accusations and prison time is costing them yet another generation of Native Americans. And they believe no one has noticed, including the candidates running for president of the United States. See all of the Embed America coverage here.

            "article_content": "Have you been affected by Hurricane Sandy? If so, share your images and footage with CNN iReport, but please stay safe. One New York hospital evacuates 200 patients; another turns to backup power At least 11 U.S. deaths have been blamed on Sandy \"Extraordinary\" amount of water in Lower Manhattan, Bloomberg says Jersey Shore police: \"The whole north side of my town is totally under water\" Though no longer a hurricane, \u201cpost-tropical\u201d superstorm Sandy packed a hurricane-sized punch as it slammed into the Jersey Shore on Monday, killing at least 11 people from West Virginia to North Carolina and Connecticut. Sandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot\u2019s fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore. Sandy\u2019s wrath also prompted the evacuation of about 200 patients at NYU Langone Medical Center. \u201cWe are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival,\u201d spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said. In addition, the basement of New York\u2019s Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital. The storm hit near Atlantic City about 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center reported. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday. Superstorm Sandy\u2019s wrath \u201cI\u2019ve been down here for about 16 years, and it\u2019s shocking what I\u2019m looking at now. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s cars that are just completely underwater in some of the places I would never believe that there would be water.\u201d Dahm\u2019s family cleared out of Atlantic City before the storm hit, but he says he stayed put to serve emergency personnel. At nightfall Monday, he said the water was lapping at the steps of his restaurant, where a generator was keeping the lights on. Sandy makes landfall Ray Kelly: We're concerned with flooding Sandy sends waves crashing in New York Blizzard conditions hit Appalachians The storm had already knocked down power lines and tree limbs while still 50 miles offshore and washed out a section of the boardwalk on the north end of town, Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford told CNN. He said there were still \u201ctoo many people\u201d who didn\u2019t heed instructions to evacuate, and he urged anyone still in town to \u201chunker down and try to wait this thing out.\u201d \u201cWhen Mother Nature sends her wrath your way, we\u2019re at her mercy, and so all we can do is stay prayerful and do the best that we can,\u201d Langford said. And in Seaside Heights, about 30 miles north of Atlantic City, Police Chief Thomas Boyd told CNN, \u201cThe whole north side of my town is totally under water.\u201d Mass transit grinds to a halt In New York, lower Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park recorded nearly 14-foot tide, smashing a record set by 1960\u2019s Hurricane Donna by more than 3 feet. The city had already halted service on its bus and train lines, closing schools and ordering about 400,000 people out of their homes in low-lying areas of Manhattan and elsewhere. Flooding forced the closure of all three of the major airports in the area, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. Water seeped into subway stations in Lower Manhattan and into the tunnel connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, while high winds damaged a crane perched atop a Midtown skyscraper under construction, forcing authorities to evacuate the surrounding area. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters there was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d amount of water in Lower Manhattan, as well as downed trees throughout the city and widespread power outages. \u201cWe knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst of the weather has come, and city certainly is feeling the impacts.\u201d The storm was blamed for more than 2.8 million outages across the Northeast. About 350,000 of them were in the New York city area, where utility provider Con Edison reported it had also cut power to customers in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan to protect underground equipment as the storm waters rose. But as water crept into its substations, Con Ed said it had lost service to about 250,000 customers in Manhattan \u2013 including most of the island south of 39th Street. Five things to know about Sandy At least five people had been killed in storm-related incidents in New York state, including three killed by trees falling on homes in Queens and in the town of New Salem, near Albany, city and state officials said. Falling trees were also blamed for three deaths reported in New Jersey and one in Connecticut, authorities there told CNN. In West Virginia, a woman was killed in a car accident after the storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the town of Davis, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin\u2019s office. Water washes over downtown Atlantic City Transformer explodes in lower Manhattan Waves lapping into New Jersey surf club Wall Street closes for Hurricane Sandy And before hitting land, it overwhelmed the sailing ship HMS Bounty, a replica of the historic British vessel, off North Carolina. Fourteen of the ship\u2019s crew of 16 were rescued, but the body of one deckhand was found Monday evening and the ship\u2019s captain was still missing Monday night, the Coast Guard said. Sandy had already claimed at least 67 lives in the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. Sandy\u2019s storm surges were boosted by a full moon, which already brings the highest tides of the month. And forecasters said the storm was likely to collide with a cold front and spawn a superstorm that could generate flash floods and snowstorms. \u201cIt could be bad,\u201d said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior, \u201cor it could be devastation.\u201d Mass transit shut down across the densely populated Northeast, landmarks stood empty and schools and government offices were closed. The National Grid, which provides power to millions of customers, said 60 million people could be affected before it\u2019s over. On Fire Island, off Long Island, the water rose above promenades and docks on Monday afternoon, homeowner Karen Boss said. Boss stayed on the island with her husband despite a mandatory evacuation order. She said they own several properties and a business there and had weathered previous storms. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it might come into the first floor,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll just move into another house that\u2019s higher up.\u201d Based on pressure readings, it\u2019s likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The benchmark storm, the 1938 \u201cLong Island Express\u201d Hurricane, contained a low pressure reading of 946 millibars;  Sandy had a minimum pressure of 943 millibars. Generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro scrawled a plea on the plywood that covered her burger restaurant: \u201cBe kind to us Sandy.\u201d The seaside area largely dodged last year\u2019s Hurricane Irene, but Cafaro was not optimistic that Sea Bright would be spared Sandy. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely worried about it.\u201d Its arrival, eight days before the U.S. presidential election, forced President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to alter or cancel several campaign stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida, telling reporters at the White House that assets were in place for an effective response to the storm. \u201cThe most important message I have for the public right now is please listen to what your state and local officials are saying,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate.\u201d And in Ohio, Romney asked supporters to drop off items and cash at his \u201cvictory centers\u201d  to be donated to victims of the storm. \u201cThere are families in harm\u2019s way that will be hurt \u2013 either in their possessions or perhaps in something more severe,\u201d Romney said. Tips from Katrina survivors By Monday afternoon, 23 states were under a warning or advisory for wind related to Sandy. Thousands of flights had been canceled, and hundreds of roads and highways were expected to flood. And according to a government model, Sandy\u2019s wind damage alone could cause more than $7 billion in economic loss. Sandy was expected to weaken once it moves inland, but the center was expected to move slowly northward, meaning gusty winds and heavy rain would continue through Wednesday. On the western side of the storm, the mountains of West Virginia expected up to 3 feet of snow and the mountains of southwestern Virginia to the Kentucky state line could see up to 2 feet. Twelve to 18 inches of snow were expected in the mountains near the North Carolina-Tennessee border. \u201cThis is not a typical storm,\u201d said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. \u201cEssentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a \u2018nor\u2019easter.\u2019\u201d Sandy grounds thousands of flights worldwide CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Cohen, Dana Ford, Tom Watkins, Josh Levs, Chelsea J.

Sandy will move slowly, could merge with cold front to pose a double threat Winds whip Florida; \"I was thinking ... this is going north? Scary,\" says a CNN iReporter As far north as New Jersey, residents prepare for long-term power outages No one hopes Hurricane Sandy lives up to its potential. The storm that has already claimed nearly two dozen lives in the Caribbean churned Friday near the northern Bahamas, and meteorologists warn that it packs the potential to slam the U.S. Northeast as soon as Monday with powerful winds and pelting rain. Worst case, Sandy could merge with a strong cold front from the west. The double threat could morph into a \u201csuperstorm\u201d that could sit over New England for days, making untold trouble for millions of residents. Weather experts said it\u2019s a recipe not unlike 1991\u2019s \u201cPerfect Storm.\u201d \u201cExpect it to move very slowly,\u201d said James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center. \u201cThe large size of the system and its slow motion will mean a long-lasting event with two to three days of impacts.\u201d At 8 p.m. ET Friday, forecasters said Sandy was about 400 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, heading north at 7 mph. It was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph. It\u2019s possible, the hurricane center says, that Sandy may weaken to a tropical storm. Nonetheless, experts said, it\u2019s not to be taken lightly. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist Hurricane Sandy 'storm of a lifetime' Hurricane Sandy hits Jamaica \u201cForget about the category with this,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. \u201cWhen you have trees with leaves on them still, this kind of wind and rain on top of that, you\u2019re talking about trees that are going to come down, power lines are going to be out and the coastal flooding situation is going to be huge.\u201d Sandy\u2019s death toll in Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba this week was 21 people. The U.S. target area is hard to predict at this point. Some landfall computer models show the storm striking somewhere between the border separating North Carolina and Virginia north to Connecticut, some of the most densely populated areas of the country. The District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and New York have declared states of emergency, while Maine\u2019s governor signed a limited emergency declaration. The National Hurricane Center reported tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect, covering parts of the Florida and Carolina coasts. With a national election already under way in many early-voting states, Sandy\u2019s wrath could have a ripple effect on politics. In Virginia Beach, a campaign rally scheduled for Sunday for GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was canceled because of Sandy. There was no word yet on the status of other events scheduled later in the week. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping an eye on it,\u201d said a senior campaign adviser. How Sandy was dubbed \u2018Frankenstorm\u2019 Similarly, Vice President Joe Biden canceled his visit to Virginia Beach on Saturday, \u201cout of an abundance of caution to ensure that all local law enforcement and emergency management resources can stay focused on ensuring the safety of people who might be impacted by the storm,\u201d according to the campaign of President Barack Obama. Bad weather in Maryland or Washington, D.C., could make it harder for people to get out and cast their ballots. Early voting kicked off Monday in Washington and is scheduled to start Saturday in Maryland. But Friday, Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley warned that his state\u2019s early voting could be affected by the pending storm, leaving open the possibility that the vote could be rescheduled, or relocated. U.S. residents in Sandy\u2019s path, forecasters said, should prepare for the possibility of several days without power. \u201cThere is potential for widespread power outages, not just for a couple of days but for a couple of weeks or more, if the storm stays on track,\u201d said meteorologist Kathy Orr of CNN affiliate KYW-TV in Philadelphia. The computer weather predictions are murky, but by Friday afternoon, it seemed unlikely the storm would bring freezing rain or snow to the coast. Snow is possible in mountain areas, including the Appalachians. Sandy could be a storm \u201cof historic proportion,\u201d Orr warned, and the City of Brotherly Love could take a direct hit. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is studying whether it should suspend all or some service ahead of the storm, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In Maryland, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company expects that several hundred thousand customers could be affected, as early as Sunday. \u201cThis could be like the \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019 21 years ago,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. A combination of three weather systems produced the famed \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d in the north Atlantic over Halloween 1991, when moisture flung north by Hurricane Grace combined with a high pressure system and a cold front, according to the weather service. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out The current weather conditions are not exactly the same as what produced the tempest. Although Grace contributed significantly to the storm, it did not progress to New England and did not make landfall, weather records show. On Friday, residents in South Jersey were already stocking up on batteries and bottled water, and hardware stores have put up preparedness displays, KYW reported. One location quickly sold out of electric generators. \u201cThis is the worst timing for a storm,\u201d Newark Mayor Cory Booker told CNN\u2019s Soledad O\u2019Brien. \u201cYou have fall ending, a lot of loose branches. \u201cThe storm itself will be bad, but I worry about the aftermath, people being caught without power.\u201d Along the Jersey shore, storm preparations included bulldozers shoring up piers with mounds of sand. Worried residents filled sandbags in case of flooding. \u2018Superstorm\u2019 meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide \u201cWe will be piling up as much sand as possible along the beachfront,\u201d said Frank Ricciotti, Margate, New Jersey, public works director. \u201cI think the water damage is worse than another type of damage, and the hardest thing is to stop water, once it starts coming up.\u201d Farther south, in the Norfolk, Virginia, area, more than two dozen ships were being sent to sea for their own protection. Strong winds whipped Florida, where CNN iReporter Simon Davis shot video of an overcast Melbourne Beach. \u201cI was surprised at just how intense it was for a storm so far off the coast. I was thinking, wow and this is going north? Scary,\u201d he wrote. Miami International Airport on Friday canceled more than 20 flights to or from Jamaica or Bahamas, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. Nearby Fort Lauderdale airport canceled 13 flights to the islands. Stay well-fed in any disaster CNN\u2019s Ed Payne contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The official responsible for the Fast and Furious report testifies at a congressional hearing Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer was criticized in the report But GOP lawmakers complain that the report was \"too soft\" on Breuer The inspector general's report refers 14 for discipline; 2 of them are already out Republican lawmakers Thursday complained to Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that his report on Operation Fast and Furious was \u201ctoo soft\u201d on the head of the Criminal Division, one of Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s top assistants. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer was criticized in the nearly 500-page report issued Wednesday for failing to follow up on internal documents showing use of flawed tactics in the controversial gun trafficking investigation on the Arizona-Mexico border. Read excerpts from the report Horowitz acknowledged in his testimony before Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s House Oversight Committee that Breuer should have acted upon the signs of \u201cgunwalking\u201d allowed by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents who botched surveillance of illegal \u201cstraw buyers\u201d who purchased firearms and transferred them to traffickers who provided them to Mexican drug cartels. Breuer has apologized for his failure, but the GOP lawmakers wanted a more serious scolding of Breuer by the inspector general, with potential disciplinary action that may have put his job in jeopardy.  Breuer is the highest ranking political appointee of the Obama administration who was stung by the report\u2019s findings His deputy assistant attorney general, Jason Weinstein, was sharply criticized by the inspector general\u2019s report, and Weinsten promptly resigned from the Justice Department Wednesday. But Breuer remains in his post. What was \u2018Fast and Furious,\u2019 and what went wrong? \u201cI think you were a little soft on Lanny Breuer,\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Horowitz. \u201cJason Weinstein reported to Lanny Breuer and as this report clearly highlights, Jason Weinstein is being made as the key person that was probably most responsible here,\u201d Chaffetz said.  He said Breuer seemed to endorse  gunwalking by not issuing any edict that the practice would no longer be allowed. The controversial practice of letting guns cross the border to track them to criminal gangs was later ended by Holder, who said it would no longer be tolerated. The inspector general estimated that about 400 firearms had been allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d under as separate strategy called Operation Wide Receiver, near the end of the Bush administration, and that about 2,000 weapons were allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d and were lost in Operation Fast and Furious begun by the ATF during the Obama administration. The report said Holder was not aware of the tactic being used, and it did not offer an opinion about whether the attorney general should have known. By the numbers: Fast and Furious In comments Thursday, President Barack Obama defended Holder\u2019s belated prohibition on gunwalking. \u201cWhen Eric Holder found out he stopped it,\u201d the president said.  Eric has my complete confidence,\u201d Obama said. The inspector general found 14 individuals who had failed to act properly in the Fast and Furious debacle. Most of them worked in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Phoenix, Arizona, or in the ATF field division there.   The inspector general said he found none of them had \u201cbad motives,\u201d and his report did not recommend any criminal sanctions.] Holder issued a statement Wednesday saying he would allow supervisors in the respective \u201centities\u201d to decide whether disciplinary action should be taken. He made no public comments about Breuer or Gary Grindler, his former deputy who now works in Holder\u2019s office. Two of the 14 are Justice Department employees who will leave immediately. In addition to Weinstein, former ATF Acting Director Ken Melson who had been reassigned to the Office of Legal Policy as a forensics adviser announced he is retiring. His former deputy director, William Hoover, recently left the ATF for a private sector job. Horowitz told Congress Thursday, \u201cthe fact that the deputy director could see the need for an \u2018exit strategy\u2019 from Fast and Furious in March of 2010, and did not receive it and review it until 2011, I think speaks volumes about what happened here in terms of failures of oversight.\u201d It was not until two lost Fast and Furious weapons were discovered at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010 that frustrated ATF whistleblowers aided by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, began to rattle cages, prompting a major review of the failed gun-trafficking sting. Horowitz said some aspects of his investigation will continue, including possible involvement in the ongoing whistleblower cases. But the drawn-out two-year drama essentially is over for Holder, who survived a battery of testy hearings, and appears safe from any further political charges on the issue. Now, the attorney general will have to brace for a series of pre-election issues, including battles over voting rights and photo ID laws.  Holder has not announced whether he would continue to serve as attorney general if Obama is re-elected. Tell us what you think: Share you reactions to the report.

            "article_content": "The long-awaited report on the controversial gun-trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious was issued by the Justice Department inspector general Wednesday. This question-and-answer looks at various aspects of the case and its controversies. What was \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019? 'Fast and Furious' arrest Fast & Furious 'never about politics' The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2013 in cooperation with legal gun dealers \u2013 traced weapons of low-level buyers, who they believed were acquiring them illegally for Mexican drug cartels. Nearly 2,000 firearms from the program went missing, some turning up at killing scenes in Mexico \u2013 and at the site of a December 2010 gunbattle in Arizona that left U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian A. Terry dead. The program has been blamed for contributing to crimes including Terry\u2019s death, and became a partisan bone of contention with the November elections approaching. What went wrong? The report released Wednesday by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general focused blame on ATF headquarters, the agency\u2019s Phoenix, Arizona, field office, and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Arizona. The report cited \u201ca series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment, and management failures that permeated ATF headquarters and the Phoenix Field Division, as well as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Arizona.\u201d Before the release of the report, ATF officials in Arizona said they were following guidelines from ATF headquarters in Washington. Read excerpts from the report Did ATF intentionally let guns \u2018walk\u2019 to cartels? Terry\u2019s tragic death put the public spotlight on Fast and Furious, and allegations surfaced that ATF officials intentionally did not intercept guns bought by straw buyers before they got into the hands of drug cartels \u2013 as a tactic intended to lead to bigger fish by following the guns. Critics have said the alleged practice allowed guns to slip into the hands of the U.S. border agent\u2019s killers. In an interview with Fortune magazine published by CNN Money, agents have denied the existence of such a method. \u201cJust the opposite: They say they seized weapons whenever they could but were hamstrung by prosecutors and weak laws, which stymied them at every turn,\u201d Fortune wrote. How did Washington politics get involved? Republicans have used the issue to attack Attorney General Eric Holder and the Obama Justice Department, which Holder oversees and which is in charge of the ATF. Congressional investigators issued a subpoena for documents from Holder relating to Operation Fast and Furious, and President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege over the documents. The Republican-led House of Representatives, along with a handful of Democrats, voted to cite Holder for contempt. The vote along party lines was followed by the House taking the contempt issue to court, where it is expected to linger until well after the presidential election. The report released Wednesday found that Holder was not informed of the controversial ATF operation until 2011, after Terry\u2019s death ratcheted up the political ramifications of the program. What is the fallout from Fast and Furious? The report Wednesday found a total of 14 employees of ATF and the Justice Department responsible for management failures in the botched operation. The inspector general referred the 14 for possible disciplinary action, but did not recommend criminal sanctions. The Justice Department announced the departure of two employees who were faulted in the report: \u2013 Jason Weinstein, deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division, resigned. The report said he failed to pass along key information about the flawed tactics being used in Fast and Furious. \u2013Former acting ATF Director Ken Melson, who had already stepped down from that role but was still working for the department in another capacity, has retired, the deparment said. The acting head of ATF, B. Todd Jones, said in a statement that his agency accepted the report\u2019s findings and that ATF would determine what disciplinary action may by handed down. On the political front, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, a leading critic of the administration on this issue, called on President Barack Obama to \u201cstep up and provide accountability\u201d for the program. Holder \u201chas clearly known about these unacceptable failures, yet has failed to take appropriate action for over a year and a half,\u201d Issa added. Holder, meanwhile, said the report found the opposite: that the leadership did not know or authorize the tactics. A timeline of \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019",

            "article_content": "NEW: ATF whistleblower calls botched probe \"egregious\" Inspector general's report refers 14 for discipline; 2 already out ATF will \"get off the mat again and keep swinging,\" acting chief says Firearms traced to the probe were at the site of the killing of Border Patrol agent  Brian Terry More than a dozen Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officials faced punishment Wednesday after a long-awaited report on the botched gun probe known as \u201cOperation Fast and Furious.\u201d That probe and a previous investigation were marked by \u201ca series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures\u201d that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach Mexican drug cartels, the Justice Department\u2019s independent inspector general concluded. Within minutes of the report\u2019s release, Justice announced rthat former acting ATF chief Kenneth Melson was retiring and another official, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, had resigned. Read excerpts from the report Weinstein and Melson were among 14 people who \u201cbore a share of responsibility for ATF\u2019s knowing failure in both these operations to interdict firearms illegally destined for Mexico, and for doing so without adequately taking into account the danger to public safety that flowed from this risky strategy,\u201d the report states. Weinstein failed to pass along key information about the flawed tactics being used in Fast and Furious, while Melson and other ATF officials didn\u2019t properly supervise the probe, the report states. Resignations after Fast & Furious report New report on Fast and Furious errors 'Fast and Furious' arrest Holder rejects Cornyn's call to resign The report referred them and another 12 officials in Washington and the ATF and U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in Phoenix to Justice officials to determine \u201cwhether discipline or other administrative action\u201d was required. Holder reacts to report \u201cFast and Furious\u201d became public after guns traced to the probe turned up at the scene of a Border Patrol agent\u2019s December 2010 killing. The resulting investigations discovered similar tactics in a 2006-2007 operation dubbed \u201cWide Receiver,\u201d also run out of Phoenix. Revelations that ATF agents watched suspected gun traffickers cross into Mexico with weapons purchased at U.S. gun shops outraged lawmakers. Larry Alt, one of the ATF agents who blew the whistle on the operation, told CNN that it was \u201cegregious\u201d that agents were watching people transfer guns to people who were handing them over to the cartels, \u201cand we were not taking an enforcement action.\u201d \u201cI would say that the persons responsible for this case \u2026 at the field level, the division level, and the headquarters level and as far as it went into the Department of Justice, should be held accountable for any decision that they made that allowed these guns to go out on the street unmonitored,\u201d Alt said. Making matters worse, the Justice Department initially denied guns were being allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d across the border, only to have to formally retract that statement in December 2011. The controversy forced Melson out at ATF, but he remained in another post at Justice until Wednesday. Acting ATF Director B. Todd Jones, meanwhile, said his agency \u201caccepts full responsibility\u201d for failing to oversee the Arizona probes. What was \u2018Fast and Furious,\u2019 and what went wrong? \u201cThis hurts. This hurts people here,\u201d Jones told reporters. But he added that the ATF has been tightening up its procedures and won\u2019t shy away from tough operations. \u201cAll we can do is get off the mat again and keep swinging,\u201d he said. The controversy fueled Republican accusations of a cover-up by the Obama administration and led to an unprecedented vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. The report found that Holder was not informed of the controversial ATF operation until 2011, after Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed. In a written statement on the findings, Holder said the inspector-general\u2019s report upholds \u201cwhat I, and other Justice Department officials, have said for many months now\u201d \u2013 that the tactics used pre-dated the Obama administration and that Justice Department leaders didn\u2019t try to hide the facts from lawmakers. \u201cIt is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations \u2013 accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI hope today\u2019s report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed.\u201d The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal But Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who brought ATF whistleblower complaints to the department\u2019s attention in early 2011, said the report \u201creaffirms virtually everything\u201d that congressional investigators turned up. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that both the ATF and the Justice Department failed to provide meaningful oversight of Operation Fast and Furious,\u201d Grassley said in a written statement. Those agencies \u201cignored warnings from employees\u201d and refused to acknowledge how bad the problem was until after months of congressional pressure, he said. And Grassley said the report inaccurately lets Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer \u201coff the hook\u201d regarding a February 2011 letter to Congress that denied guns were being allowed to cross the border. Along with the statement, Grassley released e-mails he said contradict the report. Breuer acknowledged last November he had learned that guns were allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d to Mexico, and apologized for not informing other senior Justice Department officials. The February 2011 letter to Grassley was later retracted by Justice officials. Wednesday\u2019s report criticized Breuer and another top official, Gary Grindler, who was acting deputy attorney general when the events took place, for failing to pass along information to the attorney general and other top officials. But they remain with the department. A standoff over internal Justice documents erupted after the Obama administration said it was asserting executive privilege in the Fast and Furious case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. That prompted the House of Representatives to vote a civil contempt charge against Holder \u2013 the first time a Justice Department chief has been held in contempt by Congress. Democrats protested the vote vehemently as being purely political, and the citation passed along party lines. The House took the issue to court, where it is expected to linger until well beyond November\u2019s presidential election. By the numbers: Fast and Furious Some of the documents the White House withheld under the privilege claim were included in the report. Grassley said that inclusion \u201cproves that this subset of documents could have been released earlier,\u201d and the president \u201cwas merely thumbing his nose at Congress\u201d before the contempt vote. Rep. Darrell Issa, who pushed for the contempt vote against Holder as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, the report shows \u201cwidespread failures\u201d and \u201ca near-total disregard for public safety.\u201d \u201cAttorney General Holder has clearly known about these unacceptable failures, yet has failed to take appropriate action for over a year and a half,\u201d added Issa, R-California. Holder had said he was awaiting the report to determine what actions to take against individuals involved in the case. But he has promised Congress that such \u201cgun walking\u201d of weapons into Mexico would never again be allowed. Issa called on President Barack Obama to \u201cstep up and provide accountability\u201d for the program. And Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose office produced the report, is scheduled to appear before Issa\u2019s committee on Thursday. Tell us what you think: Share you reactions to the report.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform announced Tuesday that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz will testify before the committee headed by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, Tuesday morning after the report has been made public. Attorney General Eric Holder has said he will await the report to decide what disciplinary actions he will take against those determined to be responsible for the flawed investigation. The Justice Department Tuesday had no comment on the anticipated report. Republicans have used the issue to attack Holder and the Obama Justice Department, and the release comes as the election season heats up. New report on Fast and Furious errors Chaffetz: DOJ fingerprints on gun program Exclusive interview with Terry family Two senior ATF officials familiar with the report say they are not surprised the report is said to target ATF officials in Arizona for blame in the case. Lawmakers seek answers on official at center of \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019 The officials, insisting on anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the draft report, say the findings are consistent with what Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives headquarters has maintained throughout the investigation \u2013 that much of the blame lies with officials in Phoenix who developed the operation, and largely kept Washington executives in the dark. Former U.S. Attorney in Phoenix Dennis Burke resigned over the controversy. ATF Special Agent in Charge William Newell and some of his top Phoenix associates were reassigned. ATF officials in Arizona, however, have said they were following guidelines from ATF headquarters, which recommended the field-level officials should take steps to catch top drug cartel members who receive illegal weapons from within the United States. When straw purchasers were allowed to leave Arizona gunshops with illegally purchased weapons, the sting operation was designed to track the weapons to the Mexican cartels. But the monitoring broke down and nearly 2,000 weapons were \u201clost\u201d and many are believed to have ended up with the cartels. Two of those weapons were found at the scene of the murder of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in Arizona near the border. Investigation started with agent\u2019s death Anger and embarrassment stemming from that episode led to Congressional investigations. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer acknowledged last November he had learned that guns were allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d to Mexico, and apologized for not informing other senior Justice Department officials. A letter from Justice to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, which said no guns were allowed to walk, was retracted by Justice officials. A standoff over internal Justice documents on which Holder and Issa could not agree to terms, prompted the House to vote a civil contempt charge against Holder.  The vote along party lines was followed by the House taking the contempt issue to court, where it is expected to linger until well after the presidential election. Two weeks ago, the inspector general provided a copy of the draft report for criticized parties to review and comment on before the final report is released, but officials who have seen it would not comment on the findings.

            "article_content": "A \"peace caravan\" aims to raise awareness about the drug war's consequences The month-long protest led by a Mexican poet starts in San Diego and ends in Washington Javier Sicilia: \"We want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests\" \"It will not be easy to cross the cultural divide,\" the poet says of the U.S. peace protest Telephones are ringing off the hook at this office in Mexico\u2019s capital, where a group of well-known activists are planning the final details of a protest on the other side of the Mexico-U.S. border. In a month-long Caravan of Peace across the United States, organizers say they will denounce what they believe are the devastating consequences of the fight against drug trafficking. San Diego, California, will be the first stop on Sunday for poet Javier Sicilia and 70 other members of Mexico\u2019s Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity on their trek through more than 20 cities in the United States. Along the way, 40 people whose family members are among the tens of thousands of dead and disappeared in Mexico\u2019s drug war will speak out about their experiences and work to create a new network with more than 70 U.S. nonprofit organizations. \u201cWe want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests as much in the United States as in Mexico,\u201d says Sicilia, who became one of Mexico\u2019s most prominent activists after his son\u2019s slaying in March 2011. The caravan will stop in sites north of the border that the poet considers key \u2013 including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago and New York \u2013 before arriving in Washington on September 10. \u201cIt will not be easy to cross the cultural divide to discuss subjects like drug legalization, the illegal production and sale of weapons, trafficking of migrants and money laundering,\u201d Sicilia says. And the protest\u2019s timing is another challenge, Sicilia says, noting that his group could struggle to gain attention during a fierce election campaign between incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama and his presumptive Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Still, he says he is confident that host organizations in the United States will help them create \u201ca narrative that can sensitize the U.S. population about these problems.\u201d The tough political climate, the intense waves of heat sweeping the country this summer and the large distance to cover \u2013 more than 5,800 miles (9,400 km) \u2013 have inspired Sicilia to describe his upcoming journey across the United States as an \u201codyssey.\u201d For the mystical poet, who has become a key player criticizing Mexican President Felipe Calderon\u2019s strategy to fight organized crime, the caravan through the United States is the latest leg of a journey that began after his son\u2019s slaying. In March 2011, 24-year-old Juan Francisco Sicilia\u2019s lifeless body was found with six others, crammed inside a car outside the central Mexican city of Cuernavaca. Masking tape was wrapped around their skulls, faces, wrists and ankles. Authorities believe all seven victims suffocated to death, and they have accused local police of working with cartel members in the slayings. After his son\u2019s death, Sicilia said he would no longer write poetry. \u201cThe world is no longer dignified enough for words. They are choking inside of us,\u201d he said at the time. While Sicilia stopped publishing poetry, words remain his weapon. The movement he leads surged to national prominence after thousands joined a three-day protest march culminating in Mexico City\u2019s central square  in May 2011. Since then, the poet has led a series of high-profile protests uniting people from across Mexico to tell the story of the country\u2019s losses and show the faces of those who died, disappeared or were displaced because of the fight against organized crime. \u201cI think that our main accomplishment was to put victims in the center of politics, to say, \u2018These are not collateral damages. These are not statistics. They are human beings,\u2019 \u201d Sicilia says. While he brought together witness testimonials as thousands joined his caravan marches across Mexico, he also garnered attention from the country\u2019s top leaders. The movement has met with congressmen and senators, with Calderon and with the candidates who competed to succeed him. \u201cThese are unprecedented things. They are seeds that are going to produce fruits at another moment,\u201d Sicilia says. But some of Sicilia\u2019s behavior \u2013 like demanding the resignation of Mexico\u2019s top public security official, then changing his mind \u2013 has raised eyebrows. Also, leading up to Mexico\u2019s presidential vote last month, Sicilia was criticized for saying he planned to cast a blank ballot. And for some, his poetic language has been difficult to interpret. \u201cI think that\u2019s because a lot of poetry is misinterpreted or simply isn\u2019t heard,\u201d Sicilia says. Since the movement began, in addition to protest marches across Mexico and meetings with top officials, there have been notable losses. Members of the movement protesting violence in Mexico have also become victims. In a three-month period last year, three members of the movement were killed. After these cumulative experiences, Sicilia says he feels deceived. Mexican officials have said that more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. But activists like Sicilia \u2013 who is sharply critical of Calderon\u2019s drug war strategy and the president\u2019s approach to dealing with victims of violence \u2013 say the death toll is far higher than government estimates. \u201cThe politicians don\u2019t keep their word. They are overwhelmed by reality. On their agendas, the 70,000 dead do not exist. The war does not exist,\u201d Sicilia says. Even though Sicilia founded the movement and is its most identifiable face \u2013 in 2011 he appeared as one of the protesters featured in Time magazine\u2019s person of the year edition \u2013 he says he does not consider himself its leader. \u201cThe best way to destroy a movement is to focus it on one figure and practically deify him. Through my mouth, I speak of the pain of this nation, but I am not (the nation),\u201d Sicilia says. Now, after more than a year of protests, Sicilia says this caravan could be his last. After the protest through the United States ends, the poet says he is considering returning to a spiritual retreat in France, where he spent time while his children were young. \u201cI want to go, look within myself, find my solitude \u2026 and end the pain (I feel) for my son.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article is part of an occasional series looking at the violence tied to Mexican drug cartels, their expanding global connections and how they affect people\u2019s daily lives. Earlier, we examined how U.S. demand for drugs is bringing cartel operations into rural America. Border town in New Mexico fights off financial collapse after corruption scandal Town officials and police chief admit guilt in trafficking guns to Mexican cartels Federal raid confirms Mexico's narco-corruption has infected U.S. side, too New mayor works nights as town EMT and volunteer dog catcher by day Mayor Nicole Lawson is only 37, but her hair is already turning white as she tries to keep this border town corrupted more than a year ago by Mexican cartels from falling deeper into financial ruin. Lawson runs the village by day and works as a town emergency medical technician by night. She says she often sleeps just two hours, averaging $1.47 an hour as the new mayor. The former mayor, police chief and a village trustee all pleaded guilty last year to federal charges of trafficking highly sought AK-47-style pistols to Mexican cartels. Some of the weapons were later seized at murder scenes across the border. Lawson is now fighting off a budgetary collapse of this high desert town of 2,100, where the paved and gravel roads have no traffic signals, only stop signs \u2013 and even those are so faded from the sun that the village would like to replace them if it had the money. An isolated, eccentric community near New Mexico\u2019s boot heel, Columbus sits just three dusty miles from the international border. Populated by mainstream Americans and Mexican immigrants, by the working class and the retired, this hamlet is a poor outpost with Old West roots where people don\u2019t miss society and have often dropped out of it. A 1970s commune of adobe homes still thrives, founded by people who believed extraterrestrials would land their spacecraft here. They never came. Photos: Violence in Juarez not going away History knows this town best for a raid by Mexican marauder Pancho Villa\u2019s forces on March 9, 1916. Then, 95 years and one day later, another raid occurred: A federal predawn sweep with helicopters resulted in the arrests of three local officials and eight other people, including relatives, for charges ranging from laundering money to trafficking guns to a cartel. A 12th person remains a fugitive. The federal bust here parallels a bigger U.S.-arms-to-Mexican-cartels crisis \u2013 \u201cOperation Fast and Furious,\u201d a federal sting that went awry when about 2,000 weapons reached Mexican cartels and two of the weapons were found at a site where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in 2010. Until \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d Americans knew \u201cvery little\u201d about the flow of U.S. firearms to cartels, said Josiah Heyman, an anthropology professor at the University of Texas at El Paso and an expert on violence in Mexico and its relationship to U.S. policy. In a more direct manner than the botched federal operation, the Columbus scandal confirmed that narco-corruption \u2013 so endemic to the Mexican side of the border, where cartels are believed to have even murdered mayors and police officials \u2013 has infected the U.S. side. \u201cThe part about this [Columbus] story that is very horrifying is not just the corruption of this whole town in a terrible way, but it\u2019s so closely related to an increasingly high level of violence and death next door,\u201d Heyman said. Across from Columbus is Mexico\u2019s Chihuahua state, \u201cone of the epicenters of drug organizations fighting with one another,\u201d Heyman said. Columbus\u2019 sister city across the border, Puerto Palomas, became known for narco-violence in 2009 when the mayor, Estanislao Garcia, was kidnapped and executed. His slaying was believed to have been carried out by a cartel, though the exact reasons are unknown, his successor said. Heyman describes Puerto Palomas as \u201ca lovely town that had lived off some farm and ranch exports and tourism.\u201d But he said, \u201cThe violence in Palomas has been so extreme that people have stopped going there. \u201cThe people in Columbus have to know what happens when guns are sold to Mexico,\u201d Heyman said. \u201cThey live right next to it.\u201d In small-town USA, business as usual for Mexican cartels The flow of U.S. guns south, as Mexican drugs come north, has emerged as rival cartels increasingly wage a brutal war for control of smuggling routes, analysts said. More than 68,000 firearms from the United States ended up in Mexico from 2007 and 2011, according to U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives statistics released in April. The gun owners are usually a mystery: ATF authorities have been unable to determine the purchasers of half or more of the U.S. guns found in Mexico in each of those five years, ATF statistics show. Mexican authorities report that drug trafficking organizations are more frequently using rifles such as the AK and AR variants with detachable magazines \u2013 generally, assault rifles, the ATF said. American firearms are in high demand because Mexico\u2019s firearm laws are highly restrictive and high-powered weapons such as the AK-47-style pistol are deemed for the exclusive use of the Mexican military, U.S. prosecutors said in court documents. The AK-47-style pistols resemble the AK-47 assault rifle, but with shorter barrels and without a rear stock. Cartels prefer their small size, high ammo capacity and suitability for close-quarters combat, prosecutors say. The U.S. weapons arm the cartels\u2019 military wings and enforcers, such as the Juarez Cartel\u2019s enforcement arm, La Linea, or The Line, court documents say. The Juarez Cartel, also known as the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization, controls drug trafficking in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, including Puerto Palomas, according to the documents. But since about 2008, the rival Sinaloa Cartel has been challenging the Juarez Cartel, including for control of Puerto Palomas, the records said. The Columbus trafficking ring smuggled or tried to send more than 200 high-powered firearms, mostly AK-47-style and 9 mm pistols to Mexico, court papers said. Mexican authorities seized at least 12 of the smuggled firearms, including from the murder scenes of five people in Puerto Palomas, U.S. court documents said. The accidental mayor At the center of Columbus\u2019 struggle for redemption is Lawson, whose bearing evokes more an affable librarian than a reformer of hard-core corruption. As a child, she traveled the world with her father, a Navy enlistee, and she says she\u2019s finally found a place to call home.  In 2002, a year after getting divorced, she quit her job as a fire and sheriff dispatcher in Virginia and followed her father to Columbus, who had moved here five years earlier. Though she finished dead last among three candidates in the 2010 mayoral election, the dulcet-voiced leader with a forgiving spirit is guiding Columbus through one of its darkest hours. The village board appointed her mayor last year. What this accidental mayor found in the wake of the federal raid was a village hall whose books are in such a disarray that Columbus may lose its incorporation status, utterly collapsing, not unlike Mexico\u2019s faltering border governments besieged by cartel carnage. The village, whose annual budget is just under $1 million, is facing another $1 million in debts and liabilities, which Lawson says could result in closing down the 15-employee village hall one day a week to save money. The mayor wonders whether the local government will perish for its sins. Under the prior mayor and police chief, spending went unchecked, and state auditors weren\u2019t aware of it, Lawson said. The police chief, for example, was paid $24.70 an hour \u2013 a huge sum by this impoverished town\u2019s standards. A village employee typically makes $8 to $13 an hour, Lawson said. After the police chief\u2019s arrest, the village decided to disband its five-member Police Department because it found it couldn\u2019t afford the payroll, Lawson said. For now, the Luna County Sheriff\u2019s Office has taken over policing Columbus and has stationed a deputy in the village. Columbus\u2019 inability to operate its own police department is threatening its incorporation status under state law, which requires a village to provide a minimum level of services such as law enforcement, Lawson said. In another indicator of the town\u2019s poverty, the well water here naturally contained so much fluoride that many residents\u2019 teeth molted and turned brown, officials said. About five years ago, the federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered the village to clean up the tap water with reverse osmosis, and now the town has some of the cleanest water in the state, officials said. \u201cAt this point, people will either wash their hands of us or extend their hands to us,\u201d Lawson said one recent morning as she signed payroll and vendor checks in her office. Lawson is hoping federal, state and county governments will absolve and write off most of Columbus\u2019 liabilities, but New Mexico state Sen. John Smith said that notion will be \u201cchallenging\u201d in the state\u2019s own lean finances. Columbus was so strapped for cash it spent state and federal grants earmarked for ambulances and health services on general services instead, just to keep the town running. The village even failed to pay state and federal withholding taxes as well as state gross receipt taxes on businesses and utilities, Lawson said. While he thinks the new mayor \u201cwalks the straight and narrow,\u201d Smith said he first wants to see the village\u2019s latest annual audit, which is due in this month. \u201cHistorically, Columbus has been in arrears on getting their audits in, and invariably each administration will say they are current, but when I talk to the state, they are one or two behind,\u201d said Smith, a Democrat who lives in the county seat of Deming, 30 miles away, and has spent 65 of his 70 years in the borderlands here. His district includes Columbus. For her part, the mayor says that just about everyone in Columbus is \u201cshellshocked.\u201d \u201cEvery time we find a solution to one problem, we find another problem. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re breeding. I just hope there\u2019s an end to problems before there\u2019s an end to money,\u201d she said. Lack of faith The town is literally going to the dogs: The village cut the position of dog catcher, and packs of canines from Mexico and the village have been trying to attack residents, including the mayor\u2019s 14-year-old autistic son and his blue heeler, neither of whom was injured. One older gentleman in town, the mayor says, goes for walks with a stick wrapped with barbed wire on one end to fend off the pack animals. For now, a village trustee and the mayor take turns as animal control volunteers; the mayor sets traps with leftover beef as bait, but the dogs always seem to get away and take the meat with them. Officials fear that no one will help their disgraced government. \u201cIt\u2019s been rough, with the way everybody perceives the village,\u201d said Public Works Director Robert Gomez, a town employee for 15 years, the last six of them as a department director. \u201cEven with the state Department of Finance, they don\u2019t have faith in us. They don\u2019t think they can trust us. That\u2019s pretty sad,\u201d Gomez said, referring to how Columbus\u2019 latest woes have raised eyebrows in Santa Fe, where the state\u2019s Department of Finance and Administration oversees local governments\u2019 use of public funds. Gomez added that many residents have lost trust. \u201cOther than that, we\u2019re trying to survive the best we can. As long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll do my best. Just day by day, that\u2019s the only thing we can do. People will just have to learn to trust again,\u201d he said. Luna County Sheriff Raymond Cobos isn\u2019t surprised by Columbus\u2019 fall. He can count how the village has gone through at least nine police chiefs in the past five years, making it \u201cdysfunctional at best,\u201d he told Congress last year while testifying about border security. Village administrators \u201chave a reputation of \u2026 failing to establish a culture of ethical and professional government,\u201d Cobos told the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Cobos, 64, has been patrolling the border since 1971, when he started as a deputy. In an interview at his office, he said he\u2019s certain that cartel members are working out of Columbus. \u201cIf I was a cartel member, that would be my choice,\u201d he said. \u201cGo to some small little town with a barely functioning government and then corrupt them.\u201d Cartel violence has often landed at Columbus\u2019 doorstep: Residents recall how daylight assassinations in Puerto Palomas in 2005 brought vehicles with wounded, dying or dead occupants to the border\u2019s port of entry, said Assistant Fire Chief Bill Pollock. That year, the governor declared a state of emergency and awarded $1.75 million to border counties. Pollock deemed the crimes that wracked his town\u2019s government as \u201csevere corruption.\u201d \u201cWe were aware the cartels were there, and we were aware of the problems, but to think that our leading citizens for the village may be involved in the sale and transfer of guns and weapons to Palomas was not expected at all,\u201d Pollock said. Family ties Exacerbating the public opprobrium toward Columbus is the familial relationships between five of the defendants in the federal case. Former village trustee Blas Gutierrez, 31, has pleaded guilty to 37 federal charges and is waiting to be sentenced. His wife, Gabriela Gutierrez, is facing a five-count indictment in the case. Two other relatives have pleaded guilty: Blas Gutierrez\u2019s sister, Eva Gutierrez, 22, and their cousin, Ricardo Gutierrez, 26. The former mayor, Eddie Espinoza, 52, pleaded guilty to firearms smuggling, conspiracy and making false statement in acquiring guns. He\u2019s married to Blas Gutierrez\u2019s paternal aunt, authorities said. Blas Gutierrez\u2019s father, Roberto, was a village trustee and mayor pro tem until he lost re-election in March. Neither he nor the aunt \u2013 his sister \u2013 have been implicated in the case. Other defendants include a woman from neighboring Deming, who pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a federally licensed firearms dealer and is awaiting sentencing, authorities said. Her husband was also charged and pleaded guilty, but he died late last year before he could be sentenced. In May, a federal judge sentenced firearms dealer Ian Garland, 52, of Chaparral, New Mexico, to five years in prison for aiding and abetting the firearms trafficking ring involving Blas Gutierrez, Espinoza and other conspirators by selling them 193 firearms, mostly the AK-47-type and 9 mm pistols, authorities said. Third-party purchasers, so-called \u201cstraw\u201d buyers, were used to hide the conspirators\u2019 identities in 2010 and 2011, authorities said. The owner of a grocery and the village\u2019s only bar, Roberto Gutierrez nominated Lawson to become mayor in June, which was supported by the village\u2019s two remaining trustees, Lawson said. On a recent morning, Roberto Gutierrez, 56, was visiting Lawson in the village hall. When asked about the charges against his family members, Gutierrez only replied: \u201cI think everything has been said. It\u2019s been stressing on everyone.\u201d If Columbus is to overcome its hardship, it lies in the town\u2019s resilience, the mayor said. \u201cThe people of this area are primarily of poverty. The majority of this community understands what it takes to survive in adverse or horrific circumstances,\u201d Lawson said. For income, some residents work at the local elementary school, where of 280 of its more than 600 students are from Puerto Palomas, principal Hector Madrid said. Born in the United States but raised across the border, the children walk each day through the official port of entry and are then bused to the school. Other residents pick chilies, work in mining or serve in the government sector, officials said. Beyond these routines, the town has an oddball side. Columbus is home to the City of the Sun, one of New Mexico\u2019s oldest communes. It was established in the early 1970s because its founder believed flying saucers were going to land here, according to David Pennington, 75, a retired social worker who lives in an adobe house in the commune. The village has literally grown around the commune because its alternative housing stock \u2013 made of adobe, straw bale and papercrete, with a communal shower \u2013 doesn\u2019t meet village building codes, Lawson said. The helter-skelter landscape of the commune features outlandish sculptures, such as a collection of spires and a mound with a woman holding her breasts, the latter apparently symbolizing Mother Earth. \u201cThis area, including the City of the Sun, is a crazy, dysfunctional family,\u201d Pennington said as he ate a fish lunch at the town\u2019s senior center.  \u201cIt\u2019s very much like the Wild West.\u201d A different kind of raid Indeed, it\u2019s not uncommon in these borderlands to find residents with a personal connection to Pancho Villa and his guerrillas. Sheriff Cobos said his grandfather, Bernardo, served in Villa\u2019s revolutionary army at age 13 or 14, but he left by 1915 to come to the United States, where he and other so-called Villistas were put in a detention camp in Fort Bliss at El Paso, Texas. On the opposite side is Richard Dean, 79, whose great-grandfather was killed in the notorious raid of March 9, 1916, by Villa\u2019s forces. The raid prompted U.S. Gen. Jack J. \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Pershing to lead 10,000 troops on a punitive expedition to find Villa in Mexico. After a 500-mile pursuit lasting 11 months, the expedition failed. A road on the outskirts of town near Dean\u2019s home bears the name of his great-grandfather, James T. Dean. The raid and expedition are memorialized by Pancho Villa State Park \u2013 a name Dean calls \u201ca travesty\u201d and \u201ca slap in the face\u201d because 18 Americans were killed in the raid. With buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the park has been a tourist draw. But last year\u2019s federal raid, combined with the recession a few years ago, have changed that, said Dean, president of the Columbus Historical Society Museum. \u201cThe fact that we were on the border was a tourist attraction,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a detriment.\u201d The corruption of Columbus made for an energetic election on March 6: An extraordinary field of 14 candidates competed for three seats on the village board, including the one held by Roberto Gutierrez, who lost. One of the winners was Martha Skinner, 75, who owns the town\u2019s bed and breakfast. Her son, Addison Bachman, 51, lost his bid for one of the other seats. A 21-year resident, Skinner is a former mayor and board member; she placed second in the 2010 mayoral election and blames Lawson for splitting the vote that year and letting Espinoza win \u2013 and later become a central figure in the gun trafficking case. Skinner and Bachman\u2019s campaign flyers attacked the \u201ccorruption, greed, criminals, and self-serving family interests\u201d in village government and condemned how \u201ca gun running and drug smuggling cartel\u201d was operating out of Village Hall. Whether Columbus survives as an official village or not, Mayor Lawson, the one-time wanderer, loves the place. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve had a home,\u201d Lawson said, surrounded by a handful of volunteers and employees in the Village Hall. She\u2019s going to need that strength, for there\u2019s a belief about such love that one person defending his or her home is stronger than 10 men trying to take it. And the agents of cartels often come in such groups.",

            "article_content": "Tombstone is in the Arizona desert but gets its water from the Huachuca Mountains The city's 26-mile pipeline was damaged in last summer's Monument fire and landslides Tombstone says the U.S. Forest Service had been slow to issue permits for repairs The city is suing the federal government in what may be a landmark case There\u2019s a popular saying in the American West: Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, but water\u2019s for fighting over. This dusty little city, made famous by the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, has a dilly of a water fight on its hands. Tombstone, population 1,400, is suing the federal government \u2013 and it is likely to be a landmark legal battle. Over the years, Tombstone has survived fires and floods and all manner of shiftless varmints. But now \u201cthe town too tough to die\u201d worries it\u2019s going to run dry. The city sits in the desert but gets most of its water from springs in the Huachuca Mountains. Some of the springs are in a wilderness area protected by the U.S. Forest Service. From the Huachucas, the water runs 26 miles east to Tombstone through one of the longest gravity-fed water systems in the country. Tombstone\u2019s water line was damaged in last year\u2019s massive Monument fire. The city says the feds are blocking emergency repairs that are critical to its survival. In court papers, lawyers for the federal government say there\u2019s no emergency. Instead, they contend, Tombstone is using the fire\u2019s aftermath as an excuse to \u201cupgrade and improve\u201d its water system. Kathleen Nelson, the acting ranger in charge of the Coronado National Forest, says the Forest Service has been letting Tombstone do some work, as long as it complies with the 1964 Wilderness Act. In the wilderness, Tombstone can dig with shovels, not bulldozers. The new pipe can come up the mountain on horses, not in trucks. Tombstone says that\u2019s no way to respond to a crisis that imperils the lives and property of its residents. The dispute is starting to ping on the nation\u2019s political radar. The Goldwater Institute, a conservative public policy research organization based in Phoenix, has taken on Tombstone\u2019s legal representation. The case is getting the attention of conservative bloggers, and Rush Limbaugh recently featured the water fight on his radio show, blaming everything on the Obama administration. Tombstone is planning a June event that promises to propel the controversy into the national conversation: The Tombstone Shovel Brigade will be part protest, part work party. The idea borrows from the Jarbidge Shovel Brigade near Elko, Nevada. Twelve years ago, several thousand people used chains, shovels and muscle to move a boulder and reopen a washed-out road the U.S. Forest Service had closed. Tombstone has received about 500 donated shovels so far and hopes 1,000 volunteers or more will show up to fix the pipeline. Some people are wondering why little Tombstone and its 700 water customers are worth all the fuss. City officials are quick to respond: Tombstone wrote a colorful chapter in American history. It gets more than 200,000 visitors a year.  And it\u2019s worth saving. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and that incident near \u2013 not at \u2013 the O.K. Corral brought Tombstone fame. The 30-second shoot-em-up on October 26, 1881, is immortalized in a string of Hollywood Westerns: \u201cMy Darling Clementine,\u201d \u201cWyatt Earp\u201d and the eponymous \u201cTombstone,\u201d to name a few. The gun battle is re-enacted daily in Tombstone. Tourists come from around the world to see it, retrace Earp\u2019s steps along historic Allen Street, check out the 140 bullet holes in the walls of the Birdcage Theater and read the markers at Boot Hill Graveyard, including this famous one: Here lies Lester MooreFour slugs from a .44 No Les no more. Living in the wild, wild West In Tombstone, the past and present tend to blur together. Stop at a convenience store on the outskirts and a pistol-packing cowboy in boots and spurs is likely to pick up some chaw and join the line at the register. There, they sell fake Tombstone water in bottles marked \u201cXXXX.\u201d Tombstone has been a cattle town, a cowboy town, a gold town, a silver town and a copper town. It has cycled through boom times and bust ever since veins of silver first brought fortune seekers to this dusty corner of the Arizona desert. Founder Ed Schieffelin was warned back in the 1870s that all he\u2019d find here was his tombstone, and that\u2019s how the place got its name. The desert can be an inhospitable place and it breeds people tough as Gila monsters. They are resourceful and resilient and don\u2019t cotton to being told what to do. They like being told what they can\u2019t do even less. After the Monument fire, everyone got along \u2013 at first. Tombstone asked for a Forest Service permit to make the repairs, then waited. By the end of October, the city grew tired of the wait and took an excavator up Miller Canyon, where two of its most productive springs are. The Forest Service stopped city workers, and sharp words were exchanged. Positions began to harden. Tombstone filed suit in December. A judge sent the parties into mediation in early February, hoping they could work things out. But talks broke down almost immediately. Several weeks ago, the Forest Service stopped Tombstone from bringing in a wheelbarrow for the repairs. Why on earth? Rangers say the Wilderness Act prohibits \u201cmotorized\u201d or \u201cmechanized\u201d equipment because it might damage the wilderness and disturb endangered species. The conversation showed how far apart the city and the rangers had grown, and how frustrated the city felt in following federal rules. The rangers insisted the wheelbarrow was \u201cmechanized\u201d because it had a wheel. But Tombstone managed to persuade the Forest Service to ease the restriction and prohibit just \u201cmotorized\u201d equipment. That kind of bureaucracy sounds all too familiar to many Westerners. Forty years ago it fueled the Sagebrush Rebellion over federal control of millions of acres of land in a dozen states. Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of the Republican Party, told voters at a 1980 campaign stop in Utah that he was a proud Sagebrush Rebel. The rebellion faded but never really died. Riding in the political dust stirred up by the tea party, the Sagebrush Rebellion is re-emerging this election year. Bills to seize control of federal land are burbling in Wyoming and Utah, and they\u2019re talking about it in other states, including Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Tombstone is now at front and center of the movement. \u201cForget the O.K. Corral. This is the ultimate showdown,\u201d said Christina Sandefur, a lawyer with the Goldwater Institute, which is representing Tombstone free of charge. She said it\u2019s a classic case of federal meddling. Because the case raises constitutional questions about the relationship between local, state and federal governments \u2013 issues of power and authority \u2013 it is likely to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Driving the drama is an eclectic cast of characters, the modern-day equivalents of Tombstone\u2019s early legends. There\u2019s a war hero mayor, a whip-smart school marm type, an all-knowing town clerk, even a steely-eyed stranger who rides into town, a purty gal at his side, just in time to save the day. The story began nearly a year ago with a biblical, one-two punch of fire and water. Fire on the Mountain In June 2011, Mayor Jack Henderson uneasily eyed the peaks of the Huachucas. A decorated helicopter pilot, Henderson flew medevac missions for the U.S. Marines during the Vietnam War and passenger jets for United Airlines for 33 years after that. He doesn\u2019t rattle easily, but things didn\u2019t look good. The Monument fire started at the Mexican border in early June. The billowing flames and smoke and ash bruised the Arizona sky, moving ever closer to Tombstone\u2019s 25 springs in the canyons. Henderson ran his hands through a crop of white hair, chomped on his cigar and made a command decision: Shut that pipeline down. \u201cSoot and smoke and fire retardant were everywhere,\u201d Henderson recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that to get into our water supply. I shut it down so we wouldn\u2019t get any contaminants into our 26 miles of pipeline. It was a no-brainer.\u201d Turning the water back on would prove to be a different story. Flames swept through the Arizona side of the mountains on June 16, crossing Highway 92 below Carr Canyon, where Tombstone has some springs. By then, the fire had burned more than 40 homes and melted sections of Tombstone\u2019s original seven-inch steel pipeline. Then things really got bad. The monsoon season began in July and brought record rainfall. Water rolled off the denuded slopes and gushed into the canyons, forming raging walls that tore down the remaining trees and dropped Volkswagen-sized boulders. \u201cWe knew we were going to have a problem,\u201d Henderson said, \u201cbut I had no concept of what kind of damage would be done by the monsoons.\u201d When the rain stopped, some of the springs in Miller Canyon were buried under 12 to 15 feet of rocks and gravel and broken trees. It was total devastation. \u201cThere was nothing left,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt looked like a moonscape. We lost the war up there.\u201d A state emergency official told him: \u201cYou guys have had 500 years of erosion here in one day.\u201d Henderson is not the type who wears a suit and sits behind a desk making phone calls. He donned coveralls and a hard hat and went into the mountains to assess what needed to be done. \u201cWe had little gullies up there that are now wide valleys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find the landmarks, and boulders as big as my pickup truck are gone. There was nothing we recognized.\u201d In August, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer declared a state of emergency for Tombstone and its water supply and freed  $50,000 in emergency funds for the city to make repairs. Tombstone rented equipment and applied for permits, clearing all state and federal agencies, except for the U.S. Forest Service. The city waited, and waited some more. \u201cWe were dying here,\u201d Henderson said. The city\u2019s 1.2 million-gallon reservoir, a concrete tank built on a hilltop overlooking town, ran dry at the end of August. The city had to rely on water from its wells, one of which had high levels of arsenic. If a fire broke out, the city wouldn\u2019t have enough water to put it out. Tombstone, Henderson said, was \u201cone match away from disaster.\u201d Tired of waiting, city leaders decided to push the point. Workers drove an excavator up to Miller Canyon and started moving rocks and clearing a reservoir. They were stopped by the Forest Service and ordered to stand down or, according to Tombstone, face arrest. The rangers were arrogant, Henderson said. They referred to Tombstone officials as \u201cchildren,\u201d right in front of them. Some rangers snickered during a hastily called meeting at the agency\u2019s Sierra Vista station. \u201cIf you want permission, you\u2019d better lawyer up,\u201d Henderson said he was told. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the decision, I suggest you call Barack Obama.\u201d Henderson said he \u201cassumed President Obama was a little busy for that,\u201d adding, \u201cThat\u2019s when I began to get a sense of the smugness we were dealing with.\u201d The Forest Service is not commenting on specific allegations raised by Tombstone because of the lawsuit. Eventually, Tombstone did get a permit authorizing the heavy earth-moving equipment, but only for the work already under way. It was the last time Tombstone was able to bring heavy equipment into the forest. As things now stand, the city would have to repeat the same permit process with nearly two dozen more springs. Tombstone says it doesn\u2019t have that kind of time, that it has to move fast \u2013 and with bulldozers and backhoes \u2013 before the next rainy season washes away all the repairs it already has made. So, the city followed the ranger\u2019s advice, lawyered up and took the Forest Service to court. Tombstone contends the rangers are misreading the Wilderness Act and is asking a judge to order the Forest Service to back down. As a Marine, and later as Tombstone\u2019s mayor, Henderson said he\u2019d taken an oath to protect the Constitution \u201cfrom all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d The Forest Service \u201cseems to want to take all the water rights Tombstone has and give them to somebody else,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider them a domestic enemy.\u201d The paper trail Nancy Sosa was raised in Tombstone and she remembers the stories of fires and water shortages from childhood. She remembers hearing how, when the pipeline shut down, the well water left a chalky residue, the pressure dropped and the town swimming pool stood empty in the summer heat. She grew up, left Tombstone, studied archaeology and learned how to dig through old records and reconstruct history. She came back to her hometown so her kids could know their grandparents and has been Tombstone\u2019s official archivist since December 2010. Within a month or two, Sosa uncovered a treasure: A locked metal safety deposit box with the original records from the company that built the pipeline. Nobody can be sure how long it had been sitting in the basement of the old City Hall building. Covered in dust and discarded Styrofoam coffee cups, it contained the original deeds, maps, agreements and bonds to the springs and pipeline. The documents had survived fire and flood. Some were charred, others moldy. Sosa restored and indexed them, sensing they were important, not yet aware of their value. They told the story of how, either \u201cby smart planning or dumb luck,\u201d as Sosa puts it, early leaders made sure Tombstone had a permanent and reliable water source. The fledgling city\u2019s wooden downtown had burned to the ground twice, and the silver mines needed more water than the ground could give, Sosa said. Tombstone\u2019s Huachuca Water Company went into the mountains to tap the springs. The result in 1881 \u2013 the same year as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral \u2013 was a pipeline that brings mountain spring water into Tombstone\u2019s reservoir. Tombstone bought the water line after the company went broke in 1947. Along the way, there were a series of court decisions in Tombstone\u2019s favor. Sosa has copies of them all. She has rebuilt a 130-year-old paper trail. If the maps helped Tombstone find its springs buried under rocks and debris, the other documents are helping the city prove its unbroken chain of ownership. Tombstone says its pipeline was there first \u2013 before Arizona became a state, before there was a U.S. Forest Service, before the Coronado National Forest was established, and certainly long before the federal Wilderness Act. The city argues that its rights to the springs were grandfathered in at each step. But the Forest Service is not yet ready to concede. Right after Tombstone applied for its permits, a ranger was dispatched to Tucson to look for records to dispute the city\u2019s claim. That escalated the fight. Tombstone dug in. The city now insists it owns all 25 springs outright, and has the right to maintain five acres around each one, as well as 25 feet on either side of the pipeline. The city says it doesn\u2019t need anybody\u2019s permission to work on its own property. \u201cWe had to fight to buy that water line in 1947, and we won,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cWe own that water line. In 1977, we had a similar fire, and we went in and made the repairs. In 1983, more fires again, and we\u2019re still here.\u201d Miller Peak became a federally protected wilderness in 1984. Tombstone\u2019s newly found documents are kept in a climate-controlled room in a building a block from City Hall. Sosa wears blue surgical gloves when she handles them. When Tombstone goes to court, she sits up front with the lawyers, assisting them with the nitty-gritty details. \u201cWho is that?\u201d someone from the opposing side asked a friend during a bathroom break at the courthouse. \u201cOh, she\u2019s from Tombstone,\u201d the friend replied, unaware that Sosa could overhear them from a stall. \u201cThey\u2019re all ignorant and inbred.\u201d \u2018Saving the city\u2019 Kevin Rudd had been in Tombstone just a month or two when the Monument fire broke out. He was seeking a fresh start after the construction industry flat-lined in Tucson. He\u2019d tasted success only to lose his business, his house and his shiny new truck to the recession. \u201cIt got bad, really bad,\u201d Rudd recalled, shaking his head. He\u2019d been pounding nails since he was 16, and he knew a thing or two about managing big construction projects. He came to Tombstone with the idea of maybe opening a restaurant, but quickly figured out the plan wouldn\u2019t work. He was thinking about pulling out of town when destiny found him. Sherry Kammeyer, his fianc\u00e9e, had come with Rudd to Tombstone, and she found work in a bar, dealing Texas Hold \u2018Em. One night she dealt a hand or two to Jack Henderson, and they got to talking. Kammeyer introduced her boyfriend to the mayor. \u201cWhen the fires hit and the floods came, the light went on and he said, \u2018Wow, I could use a guy like you,\u2019 \u201d Rudd said. Henderson put him in charge of the pipeline project. Rudd didn\u2019t know much about the pipeline, but he made it his business to learn. Kammeyer, a certified construction site safety expert, also began working for the city. \u201cIt was kind of a cosmic roundabout,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cIt was a crazy coincidence, but it really feels like I was supposed to be here, doing this job.\u201d The first person he saw on the new job was Sosa, and she showed him the 1901 maps of the springs. He hiked in on trails and washed-out roads, and along the debris fields. He found the springs and assessed the damage. It was still monsoon season, and more than once Rudd had to turn tail and run when the skies opened up. \u201cWe\u2019d come back and it would look totally different,\u201d he recalled. The spring in Carr Canyon, which had been surrounded by fire, was a quick temporary fix, but the one in Miller Canyon was \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d by the rockslides. Rudd and his crew, rarely more than half a dozen workers at a time, dug the springs out with shovels and picks, spending 10 to 12 hours a day in the canyons. When they found a spring, they surrounded it with sandbags. CNN accompanied Rudd in February. The terrain was rugged, the air was clear, and the view was breathtaking. It was eerily silent. Steering his city pickup past blackened trees along a rutted ridgeline trail, Rudd marveled at his blind, dumb, cosmic luck. \u201cJust another day in paradise, saving the city,\u201d he grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better project to work on. I can\u2019t give this up for anything.\u201d The work has been arduous. And Tombstone is not popular with the ranchers and retirees who live here, some of whom fear the city will trash the environment, trespass on their property and steal their water. Three dozen mountain residents have signed a petition opposing Tombstone\u2019s bid to bring in heavy equipment. Ralph and Rosemary Snapp live on five acres in Carr Canyon, in a cozy cabin surrounded by rock gardens and flowering fruit trees that attract brightly colored butterflies, moths and hummingbirds. They say they have always gotten along with the workers from Tombstone, but they are in their 80s and don\u2019t want to live in a construction zone. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a place called Sky Islands,\u201d Rosemary Snapp said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fragile, unique environment. We\u2019re trying to preserve a corridor for the wildlife, to have a place where naturalists like to come to do research on moths and butterflies, snakes and all the flora and fauna here and to let people have a place to come to be back to nature.\u201d She continued, \u201cThe land has changed, but it has changed naturally. We want to push against any digging and further excavation causing erosion. We want to live with nature here.\u201d Her husband just wants to maintain the status quo with Tombstone. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any problem with the current water line,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to see a huge expansion.\u201d Others have placed boulders in the middle of trails, and the pipeline has been vandalized. Rudd has been confronted and threatened, but he won\u2019t be chased off. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to remind anyone who crosses his path that Tombstone considers the pipeline its property. And so, he is known among the mountain folks as \u201cKevin Rude.\u201d If uncovering the springs was hard, hooking them up to the pipeline was even more challenging. Rudd\u2019s team dug trenches by hand in some places, ran PVC pipe along the top of the ground in others, laying down about 10,000 feet. Except for the one time they drove an excavator up in October, Tombstone\u2019s workers have done the work by hand, just as it was in the late 1870s. On the day of CNN\u2019s visit, about 20 prison inmates worked the pipeline. For three days, they carried sections of pipe up the mountain on their shoulders and dug trenches. Tombstone showed its gratitude with pizza. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you guys enough,\u201d Rudd said. He estimates the inmates saved him and his small crew about six weeks\u2019 worth of work. A few days later, Rudd was able to connect two of the biggest springs and direct the water into a makeshift basin downstream.  Since the beginning of March, work has slowed because the Mexican spotted owl, an endangered species, is said to be nesting in the peaks above the pipeline. Rudd doubts there are any owls up there. \u201cListen. What do you hear? Absolute silence. It\u2019s completely still. It\u2019s devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to come in and fix the pipeline.\u201d But Nelson, the acting ranger in charge, said some owl sightings have been reported. CNN returned to Tombstone in mid-March, and by then the water was flowing, if not at full speed. Rudd\u2019s makeshift pipeline was up and running. Rudd pulled back the corrugated steel lid on the city\u2019s hilltop reservoir and peered inside. Bone dry in August, it was now about a quarter full. The water was so clear, it was easy to see the bumps in the concrete bottom. \u201cI love that sound,\u201d Rudd said, as water from the mountain springs poured into the reservoir. It\u2019s a temporary fix and he dreads what the rainy season might  bring  if the city can\u2019t get its heavy equipment into the wilderness in time. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to get washed away in the first rainstorm.\u201d Politics as usual? \u201cIn the past, we had essentially no issue with the Forest Sevice,\u201d said Tombstone City Manager George Barnes. \u201cThey would issue whatever permits we needed. This time, the world seemed to have shifted.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know why, but suspects \u201ca lot has to do with the cast of characters.\u201d Somewhere along the line, things got personal. In the days of the Old West, that\u2019s when the guns came out in Tombstone. Now, they summon the lawyers and put recalls on the ballot. While he was battling the Forest Service, Jack Henderson made the mistake of ignoring his political foes. And so, on March 13, he became the first mayor to be recalled in Tombstone\u2019s history. Barnes, who oversaw the collection of the ballots, was among the first to know \u2013 even before Henderson made the announcement to a crowd of supporters gathered next door at the American Legion Hall. \u201cYou folks have a new mayor,\u201d Henderson said, greeted by a group groan. Nobody that night could really say what the recall was about \u2013 not even the winner, Stephen Schmidt. It only takes one vote to change the course of history. Henderson lost by 51. Schmidt seemed surprised he\u2019d won and not quite sure what to do about it. He did not seem to know much about the pipeline or the legal battle. He didn\u2019t appear to have a water plan, except, perhaps, to look into drilling more wells. A former councilman who runs a local bar, Schmidt said Henderson was \u201ca good guy\u201d who had been doing a good job after a shaky start. Small town people are usually unhappy with the status quo, especially when times are tough, he said. Schmidt campaigned against what he considered unnecessary expenses, putting Sosa, the city archivist, near the top of his hit list. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a public works director and we have a city archivist?\u201d he told CNN as someone cranked up Bon Jovi\u2019s \u201cDead or Alive\u201d on the speakers outside his bar, Johnny Ringo\u2019s. (The bar takes its name from one of the cowboys who battled Wyatt Earp.) Sosa, knowing she\u2019s a potential target, cleaned out her office on election night. But she is continuing her work at the archives, at least for now. Rudd dodged a pink slip last month, when Schmidt suggested cutting the pipeline project from the budget to save money. But the new mayor backed down after the Goldwater Institute advised against it and the City Council split on the issue. Barnes, the city manager, hopes the council can keep the lawsuit on track. \u201cNow is one of those moments of necessary maturity,\u201d said Barnes, a retired Xerox manager from upstate New York. \u201cThey either step up and become the functional group they have to be or they don\u2019t and things stop.\u201d There\u2019s a lot at stake: Mountain spring water is flowing into Tombstone for now, the city is suing the federal government, Rush Limbaugh is making the case a national election year issue and the shovel brigade is coming to town. If Tombstone doesn\u2019t rise above its habit of factions and bickering, it just might shoot itself in the foot. For now, Schmidt seems satisfied to let the Goldwater Institute carry on with the lawsuit because it is costing the city virtually nothing. He has filed papers to run for mayor in the August primary. Henderson also is considering another run at the office, and there\u2019s a third candidate in the race. Meanwhile, everyone will be back in court, probably by the start of the rainy season, July 1. In Tombstone, they\u2019re still talking about one courtroom exchange that made their jaws drop. One of the city\u2019s lawyers was grilling a Forest Service supervisor. \u201cSir, just tell me: What is more important? Owls or people?\u201d the lawyer asked. The supervisor hesitated, and then explained, \u201cWe have to balance the needs of the resource with the needs of the people of Tombstone.\u201d If the point was lost on the Tombstone contingent, it made perfect sense to the rangers at the Forest Service. A wilderness, explained Nelson, the acting ranger in charge, is \u201can area where the Earth and its community of life are untrampled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\u201d Some places are too wild to tame, and the Wilderness Act addresses that, she added. Nelson was assigned to the local ranger station after the tense early days of the dispute, and she has tried to smooth things over. But it may be too late. It is not yet clear how the federal government will respond to the shovel brigade. Authorities have sought court injunctions \u2013 without success \u2013 to try to stop similar brigades, such as the one in Jarbidge. The organizers prevailed on First Amendment grounds. Henderson knows he didn\u2019t campaign hard enough to keep his job. Most people would say he barely campaigned at all. But he\u2019ll be carrying a shovel and leading the brigade. If it comes off as planned, the Tombstone Shovel Brigade could take a place in Western history, right next to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Environmentalists and the oil lobby differ on the need for further review of the project The pipeline has become a political football in a U.S. election year Republicans accuse the Obama administration of stalling the project Federal and state officials say it will take months to decide on the new permit request A Canadian company has reapplied for a permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline that would connect the tar sands oil development in northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the State Department announced Friday. TransCanada Corp. wants a permit for a section of the pipeline that would run from the Canadian border to connect to an existing pipeline in Steele City, Nebraska, according to a State Department statement. The issue has become a political football in the United States, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of delaying the project in an election year to placate the environmental lobby. Top Republicans, including presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, say the issue shows that Obama\u2019s energy policies are harming economic growth. The administration says Republicans are trying to force approval of the pipeline project before necessary review has been completed. Obama fast-tracks oil pipeline to Gulf Will Keystone extension create jobs? Earlier this year, the State Department, which has authority over permits for international pipelines, rejected TransCanada\u2019s first application because it lacked an alternate route to avoid a vital aquifer in Nebraska. Last month, TransCanada proposed an alternate route through Nebraska, and state officials say it will take six to nine months to fully review it. In its statement Friday, the State Department said it was \u201ccommitted to conducting a rigorous, transparent and thorough review.\u201d \u201cWe will begin by hiring an independent third-party contractor to assist the department, including reviewing the existing Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) from the prior Keystone XL pipeline review process, as well as identifying and assisting with new analysis,\u201d the State Department\u2019s statement said. It said that previous estimates for a final decision on the 1,700-mile pipeline \u2013 intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day \u2013 targeted the first quarter of 2013. Last year, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013, citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the Ogallala  Aquifer, which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state\u2019s agricultural economy. Republicans accused Obama of putting off the issue until after the November election, then forced the addition of a provision to speed up approval of the project  in the December debt ceiling agreement despite warnings by Obama that the 60-day timeline for a decision would guarantee rejection. The State Department turned down the application in February, and TransCanada then proposed a new route through Nebraska. Supporters, including the oil industry, say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on oil imported from volatile regions. Republican leaders have continued pressuring Obama and Democrats to speed approval of the pipeline, saying the project has already undergone several years of review. The American Petroleum Institute, which advocates for the oil industry, called Friday for the government to approve the new permit application without further review. \u201cThe earth hasn\u2019t moved, the geology hasn\u2019t changed, the information remains the same, so there should be no reason for a re-review,\u201d said API Executive Vice President Marty Durbin. \u201cThe pipeline will be state of the art and has already been thoroughly examined for more than three years, including three environmental assessments.\u201d Opponents, including environmentalists, say that the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the United States into a particularly dirty form of crude oil that might ultimately end up being exported anyway. Anthony Swift of the Natural Resources Defense Council called Friday for a thorough review of the new application that examines the proposed pipeline as well as the merits of tar sands oil development. \u201cThe world of oil and our understanding of the dangers of tar sands have changed since the first time TransCanada applied for a permit for Keystone XL back in 2008,\u201d Swift wrote on the group\u2019s website. \u201cThe process for evaluating this permit request needs to be thorough, rigorous, transparent and free from conflicts of interest.\u201d Obama announced in March that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Oklahoma \u2013 a key repository of U.S. oil \u2013 to the Gulf. He had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion, even when the administration blocked the full project. Currently, there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in Canada and North Dakota to refineries and terminals on the Gulf. That means Midwest refineries can pay lower prices to get it. Giving the Canadian oil easier access to the Gulf means the glut in the Midwest goes away, making it more expensive for the region, but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets. Mike Linder, director of the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, told CNN last month that it will take at least six months for the state to fully review the alternate route proposed by TransCanada. Linder, a Republican who is a political appointee, said the first step would be public hearings. TransCanada will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route, he said. Once TransCanada submits that final proposal to his department, it should take 30 to 60 days for the review to be completed and a draft supplemental impact statement prepared, Linder said.

            "article_content": "El Paso County commissioner Guillermo Gandara Jr. is \"shocked\" at charges, lawyer says Gandara is running for the Texas Legislature and comes from an active Democratic family He and another man are accused of conspiring to sell 50 kilograms of marijuana \"Elected officials who engage in drug trafficking violate the public trust,\" DEA agent says An El Paso County commissioner who\u2019s also a Democratic candidate for the Texas Legislature has been indicted on charges of trafficking 50 kilograms of marijuana and money laundering, authorities said Friday. El Paso County Commissioner Guillermo \u201cWillie\u201d Gandara Jr., 37, of El Paso, and an associate, Juan Canales, 50, of San Elizario, were indicted on a count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute the 50 kilograms or more of marijuana and another count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Gandara comes from a well-known political family in El Paso County, where he, his brother and their father have served on the school board or city council or both in Socorro, according to Gandara\u2019s attorney. Gandara, whom the indictment says went by the alias \u201cGodfather,\u201d is also charged with three counts of maintaining property in El Paso County for the distribution of marijuana since November 2010. Authorities are seeking criminal forfeiture of any property derived from the alleged crimes. Gandara\u2019s attorney, Joe A. Spencer, said his client was \u201cshocked\u201d at the allegations. \u201cHe has no knowledge of what the government is accusing him of,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI have not seen any of the evidence. We\u2019re not privy to the discovery yet.\u201d Gandara was arrested Thursday afternoon while he, his wife and their children were driving from San Antonio. They were stopped at a routine U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint at Sierra Blanca, where Gandara was identified and apprehended, Spencer said. The children were on a semester break from school, Spencer said. Gandara had his initial appearance in federal court in El Paso on Thursday. Federal prosecutors are seeking to detain Gandara without bond, which he will oppose, Spencer  said. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday, the defense attorney said. \u201cIt\u2019s our contention that he\u2019s not a flight risk and he\u2019s not a danger to the community,\u201d Spencer said. Gandara will remain on the county commission, Spencer said. Gandara is running for Texas state representative of District 75, according to the Texas Democratic Party website. The incumbent, state Rep. Chente Quintanilla, is not seeking re-election and, in fact, is seeking the county commission seat now occupied by Gandara, Spencer said. \u201cWe have not had any discussions about his political future\u201d running for the statehouse, Spencer said about his client. \u201cWe have been focusing on these allegations.\u201d\u2019 Gandara\u2019s brother, Gary, and their father, Willie Sr., served as mayor and school board members in Socorro, a suburb of El Paso, Spencer said. Gandara also served on the Socorro school board, the attorney said. \u201cThey\u2019re all politically involved,\u201d Spencer said, adding the family is Democrat. If convicted, Gandara and the other defendant face up to 20 years in federal prison on each count, authorities said. \u201cElected officials who engage in drug trafficking violate the public trust,\u201d Joseph M. Arabit, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s El Paso Division, said in a statement. \u201cAs this lengthy investigation attests, DEA and its law enforcement partners are committed to holding drug traffickers accountable for their illegal activity, regardless of their position, and we will not allow the actions of a few to tarnish the honorable work that other government officials perform each day. The residents of El Paso County deserve no less.\u201d",

While Republican candidate Mitt Romney said he would support construction of the 1,700-mile pipeline, for the jobs he said the pipeline would create, Obama in the past has rejected rapid approval, citing what he called the \u201carbitrary nature\u201d of the deadline Republicans proposed for passage and the need for sufficient time for the State Department to gather information necessary for a project that crosses into the American border. Nearly a year ago, the State Department announced the decision to delay until after the 2012 election consideration of the controversial project that would originate in Alberta, Canada,\u2019s tar sands and would extend to the Gulf of Mexico. Keystone pipeline protesters arrested in Texas On Sunday, protestors flooded Washington\u2019s Freedom Plaza, before laying down their signs and picking up a 500-foot plastic \u201coil pipe,\u201d which they carried a few blocks to the White House. Daryl Hannah takes on a bulldozer PIckens on importance of Keystone One of the event\u2019s main organizers, founder of 350.org, Bill McKidden, said that activists may have been silent but haven\u2019t forgotten about the project and now they\u2019ve organized to remind the administration of their commitment to preventing fossil fuel based projects that they say are causing increased climate change. \u201cThey said a year ago they would study it further, now that year is up, and in the meantime we\u2019ve had the hottest year in America history, we\u2019ve had an epic drought, we\u2019ve had the Arctic melting and we\u2019ve had Superstorm Sandy flooding the subways of New York,\u201d said McKibben. \u201cThe pipeline has come to symbolize something much, much bigger than just one energy project, it\u2019s come to symbolize what is our energy future, and what President Obama is going to do on climate change,\u201d said activist Jane Kleeb of the anti-pipeline organization Bold Nebraska, in a state where the Keystone XL project would cut through predominantly agricultural areas. At issue is the potential for water and soil contamination from the 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude oil that would traverse the pipeline each day. Film director Josh Fox, whose documentary \u201cGasland\u201d examined the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, also known as \u201cfracking,\u201d was among protesters with camera in hand. \u201cI\u2019m here doing a film on (McKidden\u2019s 350.org\u2019s) \u201cDo the Math,\u201d and the math tells us that we have more fossil fuels in the ground than is supportable by the atmosphere without total catastrophe and calamity,\u201d said Fox.",

            "article_content": "East Coast storm damage, power outages raise questions about Election Day voting Unlikely Congress would extend voting nationwide due to problems in storm-struck states Election officials in NJ, NY are left with more questions than answers. States on the outskirts of Sandy's wrath will fare better on November 6 When Sandy slammed into the East Coast on Monday, it set into motion a tight timeline for election officials: one week to ensure that voters in states from Virginia to New Hampshire would be able cast their ballots on Election Day. But power outages, flooding and snow left in the storm\u2019s wake could make that impossible for voters in some of the hardest-hit states. Some fire stations, schools, community centers and other venues that serve as polling places will have to be cleaned up if they were flooded or damaged. Other polling spots may need to be relocated if they are too damaged to be used. Voting machines may have to be dropped off at some polling places with election officials gambling that power will be restored there by Tuesday. Obama vows relief for Sandy victims 2011: Romney on disaster funding options Romney: A tiny effort makes a difference Opinion: Don\u2019t let superstorm sway your vote Many electronic voting machines \u2013 used now by two out of every five counties nationwide, according to the Voting Technology Project \u2013  often require consistent power to work for the long hours they are needed on Election Day, even though some have battery power. If electricity remains out in some areas next Tuesday, those areas may have to scramble to find alternatives, including paper ballots. It is unlikely voters in the hardest hit states will be given an extension if they cannot access polls, despite damage from the storm. Only Congress can change Election Day, according to an 1845 law. If it opts to alter the timetable \u2013 something never previously done \u2013 every state would have to be included. The same law also says that if a state \u201cshall fail to make a choice\u201d on Election Day, then electors to the Electoral College may be appointed on a \u201csubsequent day\u201d as determined by state law. As state and county election officials throughout the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast work to coordinate logistics at polling stations scattered across Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, it is still unknown whether all voters in the states hardest hit by Sandy will have the opportunity to cast their ballots on Election Day. Obama updated on Sandy through the night; praised by Christie New Jersey: \u2018We\u2019re not sure. At this point, we\u2019re looking at a lot of changes.\u2019The biggest challenge for election officials in the Garden State are logistical: power outages, blocked roads and flooding, according to Dennis Kobitz, president of the New Jersey Association of Election Officials. Election officials have been in touch on conference calls since the storm hit on Monday. On a call on Tuesday, election officials from Essex, Bergen and Union counties said electrical outages were the chief concern; in Ocean, Mercer and Monmouth counties, officials said their biggest obstacle was flooding. Calls to election officials in these counties were not immediately returned. Kobitz has had to scale back the number of polling locations in Union County because of power outages and access problems to some of the 190 polling locations. \u201cWe would like to keep one to two polling places in each town,\u201d Kobitz said, because he doesn\u2019t like to force voters to travel long distances. Delivering electronic voting machines from the county\u2019s warehouse to polling stations is also presenting a problem. \u201cOur biggest problem at this point is getting the machines to the polling places. Nobody\u2019s there to accept the machines,\u201d Kobitz said, noting that many of the them are locked and without power. \u201cDo I leave [the polling machines at the polling stations]?\u201d Kobitz asked, frustrated with the unknown. \u201cHow do I take a chance that the schools will have power?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t just deliver 433 machines \u2013 there\u2019s no way to do that in one day,\u201d he said. Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he was confident that New Jersey residents would be able to cast ballots next week. But he said he was focusing on emergency needs first, saying that there would be time to worry about voting. \u201cI\u2019m sure that as Election Day gets closer, we\u2019re going to find ways to make sure that it\u2019s as functional as possible and people are able to vote,\u201d Booker told CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point on Tuesday. Opinion: Sandy debunks \u2018nanny state\u2019 New York: Cards stacked against them For election officials in Nassau County, New York, located on Long Island just east of Manhattan, the cards are stacked against them. The county, which was declared a disaster area following Sandy\u2019s beating on Monday night, has experienced many of the same problems as the hardest-hit areas, including flooding and power outages. Ninety percent of the county\u2019s polling stations are currently without power, Nassau County Democratic Elections Commissioner William Biamonte said. Those stations that do have power are in firehouses and are running on generators. Sixty-eight of the county\u2019s polling stations counted as of Wednesday were in flood plains and may have been damaged. County officials still don\u2019t know for sure. In addition to power outages and flooding, staffing at the elections sites could prove problematic in Nassau County. Elections officials were in the process of training 55 elections inspectors to oversee the vote. Since the storm, training has stopped, Biamonte said and some of the training locations are being used as shelters. Another concern - most of the elections inspectors, Biamonte said, are seniors. In addition to disruptions in training, he said, elections officials are unsure if the inspectors evacuated ahead of the storm. Perhaps the silver lining for Nassau County is that it votes by paper ballot. Determined to see voting goes on, Biamonte said, \u201cThe process could have to go back to Colonial times that instead of voting with lanterns we\u2019ll be voting with flashlights.\u201d CNN was unable to reach elections officials in New York City\u2019s other surrounding counties. New York does not offer early voting. Political Mann: Candidates, voters forced to navigate Sandy Pennsylvania: \u2018We\u2019re currently in the process of assessing the situation\u2019 Pennsylvania\u2019s eastern counties that lie along the Delaware River and the state\u2019s border with New Jersey are among the hardest hit by Sandy. In New Jersey\u2019s Bucks County, just north of Philadelphia, election officials are grappling with similar logistical difficulties that are plaguing officials in New Jersey. According to Deena Dean, Director of Bucks County Board of Elections and Registration, voting machine delivery to the county\u2019s 215 polling locations is a challenge. \u201cThe voting machines were supposed to be delivered beginning on Monday of this week and we couldn\u2019t begin to deliver until today,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThe hauler has to call every polling place and reschedule delivery,\u201d Dean said. \u201cSo as the hauler reschedules deliveries, we are being notified of that.\u201d Dean said she wasn\u2019t sure what Election Day would look like. Statewide, Ron Ruman, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, doesn\u2019t anticipate tremendous disruptions. \u201cCounties have emergency plans that are put in place every year. It\u2019s not unusual for us to have polling places every year that need to be changed (for one reason or another),\u201d Ruman said. Ruman said he didn\u2019t anticipate that more than \u201cone or two polling places will have to be moved.\u201d Virginia: \u2018I don\u2019t want anything to interrupt\u2026democracy\u2019 In Virginia, one of the tightest of the battleground states where the storm left more than 114,000 customers without power, Republican Gov. Robert McDonnell said the state is working to return power to election offices without power. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to interrupt with full participation in democracy as we go up into into this presidential election,\u201d McDonnell said during a press conference Tuesday. \u201cRight now, our assessment is that there are nine registrar\u2019s offices without power. Our friends from the power companies have made that a top priority \u2013 after hospitals and nursing homes and so forth \u2013 to restore their power. We anticipate that all those will be back within a day or two.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there\u2019ll be any problem with any voting location, any precinct. Of the 2,800 or so precincts, none of them we anticipate will have any problem being fully operational next Tuesday.\u201d McDonnell said that the state would also extend absentee voting through Nov. 3 and has asked registrars \u201cto stay open for up to eight additional hours to be able to make up for the time that a citizen may not have had to vote absentee over the last two days.\u201d Virginia does not have blanket early voting. Lisa Connors, a spokeswoman for Fairfax County government, said officials who manage elections locally were making assessments but did not anticipate any disruptions. The county is one of the swing state\u2019s most populous and most heavily contested areas. Virginia, like other states, has options, including a provision in state law that allows for polling places to be relocated.

            "article_content": "Top House Democrat says lawsuit is a waste of time, political distraction House committee files lawsuit in dispute over \"Fast and Furious\" documents Lawsuit seeks order rolling back White House executive privilege claim in case The dispute centers on controversial weapons tracking program The House Oversight Committee filed a civil contempt lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday seeking the release of documents linked to a controversial weapons crackdown. The lawsuit asks a federal court judge to rule that President Barack Obama overstepped his authority in claiming executive privilege over documents sought by the committee in its investigation of the Fast and Furious weapons tracking program. The lawsuit also seeks an order requiring Holder to turn the documents over to House investigators. \u201cWaiting nearly eight months after the subpoena had been issued to assert a meritless claim of privilege, the President\u2019s decision was a calculated political maneuver designed to stop the release of documents until after November\u2019s elections, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, said in a statement. No criminal prosecution of Holder for contempt The lawsuit stems from a contempt of Congress citation passed by the House of Representatives last month, and was expected. House holds Holder in contempt Rep. Mica calls for Holder resignation Dems decry contempt vote's 'skunktivity' New report on Fast and Furious errors The House resolution gave lawmakers the option of filing a lawsuit if the Justice Department declined to file criminal charges against Holder. Democrats say the GOP is using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and Obama in an election year. \u201cThis partisan lawsuit wastes taxpayer dollars and resources, and is a distraction from the urgent business before Congress: acting to create jobs and grow our economy,\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a written statement. \u201cIt is also designed to distract the Justice Department from its critical job of challenging state laws designed to restrict the rights of Americans to vote.\u201d Justice Department Director of Public Affairs Tracy Schmaler said in a statement that Holder\u2019s department had been \u201calways willing to work with the Committee, instead the House and the Committee have said they prefer to litigate.\u201d The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched the Fast and Furious program in Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. It followed similar programs started in the Bush administration. The program lost track of more than 1,000 firearms, two of which turned up in the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Fast and Furious investigation started with agent\u2019s death The Justice Department announced on July 6 that it would not prosecute. The department said it has had a longstanding position across administrations of both parties not to proceed with prosecution when a president has asserted executive privilege, as Obama did. Executive privilege refers to a president\u2019s authority to refuse to comply with some demands from lawmakers and judges to turn over documents and other materials. The Obama administration said it was asserting the doctrine in the Fast and Furious case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. Issa said the president was violating his promise to operate openly. \u201cAfter promising an unprecedented level of transparency, the President is attempting to expand the reach of executive privilege to obstruct the truth about the reckless conduct that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol Agent and countless Mexican citizens,\u201d Issa said. \u201cThe family of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, whistleblowers who faced retaliation for exposing the Justice Department\u2019s reckless tactics, and the public have a right to know the full extent of what occurred.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner applauded the filing. \u201cAfter providing \u2013 then retracting \u2013 inaccurate information to Congress, Attorney General Holder has gone to extraordinary lengths to block access to subpoenaed documents and deny the efforts of the Terry family to get the truth,\u201d he said in a statement. AME Church likens Congress\u2019s Holder vote to \u2018evil strategies\u2019 following Reconstruction The showdown between Issa and Holder over the program dates to subpoenas issued last year by the House committee seeking a wide range of documents and other materials. Eventually, the committee reduced its demand to focus on documents involving decision-making after the administration shut down the Fast and Furious program.

            "article_content": "Gun control steps shouldn't be controversial, Obama says Reid: \"With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control.\" Pelosi: \"There are important voices on all sides of this issue\" Rep. Grijalva: Protecting Second Amendment rights and public safety not a contradiction President Barack Obama broke his silence on the Colorado movie massacre Wednesday night and spoke out on the issue of gun control. \u201cI believe the majority of gun owners would agree \u2026 that we should check someone\u2019s criminal record before they can check out a gun seller; that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily,\u201d said the president. \u201cThese steps shouldn\u2019t be controversial. They should be common sense,\u201d he added. Shouldn\u2019t be controversial? Common sense? The president knows full well that Democratic strategists \u2013 including those who run his re-election effort \u2013 see gun control as political dynamite. They have since Al Gore lost the presidency by failing to win conservative states, an outcome many Democrats blame in part on Gore\u2019s push for gun control. For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics Romney: I don't support new gun laws Obama: AK-47s are for soldiers Candidates evolve on gun control Lawmakers remember Colorado victims Still, Obama is the party\u2019s leader. So we wanted to know whether his Democratic colleagues in Congress agree. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could disagree with what the president said yesterday,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid agrees and he controls the Senate agenda. So he can do something about it. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett asked the next logical question. Will Senate Democrats act? \u201cWith the schedule we have, we\u2019re not going to get into the debate on gun control,\u201d Reid responded. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy, I\u2019m glad the president made the statement because it\u2019s something that needs to be done. But we\u2019re not going to address gun control.\u201d he said flatly. So action won\u2019t happen this year. What about next year? Barrett followed up: \u201cIf you hold onto the majority next year, would Democrats commit to making it part of your agenda?\u201d he asked. Reid smirked in a way that made clear he could see the political minefield ahead, and he wasn\u2019t going anywhere near it. NRA sends Democrats a message over AG contempt vote \u201cNice try. Nice try, OK?\u201d he glared. In the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was prepped and ready for questions about the president\u2019s comments on gun control, telling reporters she viewed his remarks \u201ca number of times.\u201d \u201cI thought his comments were very thoughtful \u2013 provided leadership when he said we need to build a national consensus to reduce violence in our country,\u201d she said. Unlike Reid, Pelosi does not control the House agenda, but she\u2019s never shy about using her microphone to make clear what Democrats want. She\u2019s also a seasoned politician who wants the House majority and her speaker\u2019s gavel back. That means retaking conservative districts where guns are popular. She danced delicately. \u201cThere are important voices on all sides of this issue.  We really need, we all recognize the importance of the Second Amendment and the need to, and also the need to reduce violence in our communities,\u201d Pelosi said. We then took the president\u2019s remarks to the halls of Congress and asked rank and file Democrats what they thought. Hill Democrats look to \u2018silent majority\u2019 on gun control Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley is from New York City, where being anti-gun isn\u2019t very dangerous politically. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get cold medicine in Colorado or anywhere else than it is to get 6,000 bullets apparently over the Internet and I think that\u2019s, you know, a common sense conversation that needs to take place,\u201d Crowley said. But Arizona\u2019s Raul Grijalva is a Democrat from the kind of pro-gun congressional district his party is panicked about losing by pushing too hard on gun control. Still, he said he thought the presidents remarks were an \u201can important ice-breaker.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted conversation for too long. You know, not just the tragedy that happened in Colorado. It\u2019s a continuing cycle, and we don\u2019t talk about it, and I think there is rational discussion that needs to occur,\u201d Grijalva said. Being from an Arizona border district full of voters who cherish their gun rights, Grijalva said he was sure he would be hearing about these remarks from some upset folks back home. \u201cI think it\u2019s a tough thing, because the (National Rifle Association) carries with it a threat, a threat that if you speak against any point of gun control, you automatically face a political threat,\u201d Grijalva said. He is well-versed on the history of his party\u2019s retreat from the politics of gun control. \u201cSince 1994, after the Crime Act, that we lost the House in those years because of that, and there\u2019s been a reluctance to address it, and like I said, the perceived threat of the NRA,\u201d Grijalva said. \u201cI think the majority of the American people want us to have a rational discussion that protects their fundamental rights and the Second Amendment, but also protects the public safety. I don\u2019t that\u2019s a contradiction,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "The majority staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee releases a report on Mexico It concludes that the focus should be on training police and judiciary The report says the largely military effort has been ineffective or counterproductive Mexico\u2019s frontal assault against drug cartels has been \u201clargely ineffective\u201d and in some instances counterproductive to reducing violence, a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report concludes. The report, released Thursday, was produced by the committee\u2019s majority staff ahead of a political transition in Mexico\u2019s presidency and the U.S. election, both events that could alter binational cooperation. Going forward, a focal point of anti-drug cooperation should be training and institution-building in Mexico\u2019s police forces and judiciary, the report says. By training police and equipping them to investigate drug-related killings, the military component of Mexico\u2019s current strategy can be scaled back, the report says. Mexico\u2019s Nieto calls for \u2018new debate\u2019 on the drug war Mexican President Felipe Calderon\u2019s term, which comes to an end in December, will be remembered for a surge in the number of troops deployed across Mexico to help combat drug cartels. A number of high-ranking cartel figures have been arrested, but critics question if the government has achieved anything other than a reshaping of the factions fighting for control of lucrative smuggling routes. As the market for which a majority of the illegal drugs are destined, the United States has contributed to Mexico\u2019s efforts through the Merida Initiative. Congress has appropriated more than $1.9 billion for the initiative, which has provided helicopters and equipment, as well as training for police and judges. The report calls for continuation of Merida funds, but says they should be aimed at helping the police and judiciary. \u201cMexico\u2019s presidential transition provides a new window to discuss and debate the best security strategies to deal with the serious violence plaguing Mexico,\u201d Committee Chairman Sen. John Kerry said in a written statement. \u201cAs the political landscape continues to change in both countries, this report underscores the importance of continuity in two critical areas \u2013 judicial and police reform. Mexicans have committed to these fundamental reforms and as tough as they will be to implement they are fundamental for any sustained reduction in violence in Mexico.  These are worthy efforts that must succeed.\u201d Alleged Mexican cartel operative \u2018La Bonita\u2019 arrested According to the report, which was based on interviews in Mexico with authorities from both countries, as well as experts, Mexico has so far been slow to accept training for officers. Merida Funds for the current fiscal year will be largely directed toward capacity-building, and the report recommends that the United States continue to stress the importance of reforms. The report recommends continuing Merida funds at $250 million a year for four more years. Even if Mexico resorts to using the military as a stop-gap measure to combat the violence, \u201cincreased civilian police capabilities will obviate the need to deploy military personnel for domestic security purposes,\u201d the report says. Mexico\u2019s federal police force has made strides in both size and capacity over the past several years, but reforms in state and local police departments have lagged, the report states. The Mexican government can succeed only if it enlists the help of state and local police, the report says. It is a tall order \u2013 corruption is most prevalent at the local and state levels, where officers are routinely on the payrolls of the various drug trafficking organizations. Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico\u2019s presumptive president-elect, told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria this week that he is open to a new debate on how to wage the war on drug trafficking, which will include a review with U.S. participation. \u201cWhat we seek now in our new strategy is to adjust what\u2019s been done up until now. It\u2019s not a radical change. It\u2019s to broaden the coverage and, above all, the emphasis I aspire to of reducing the violence in our country,\u201d Pena Nieto said. The Senate report puts the number of drug-related deaths during Calderon\u2019s term at more than 55,000. On the border: Guns, drugs \u2013 and a betrayal of trust",

            "article_content": "Analysis: 21 Democrats voted to hold Holder in contempt; 19 received NRA contributions Democrats in competitive districts may be trying to show independence, expert says Votes against party lines can be heartfelt but are mostly for political survival, expert says NEW: Democrats launch campaign against House Republicans who voted for contempt When the National Rifle Association decided to keep track of those House members on both sides of the aisle who voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress last week, it was also sending a message to a number of embattled Democratic congressmen seeking re-election in conservative districts in the fall. The message: Vote right, or we\u2019ll let your constituents know. Though some Democrats say the NRA did little to influence their vote, for a handful of those in the House, the message may have been received loud and clear, experts say. A CNN analysis showed that of the 21 Democrats who voted to hold Holder in civil contempt of Congress last week over documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious, 19 received campaign contributions from the NRA during the last two election cycles. The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal House holds Holder in contempt Dems decry contempt vote's 'skunktivity' Holder won't be prosecuted During that period, all of the 21 were targeted by the National Republican Campaign Committee, signaling the organization\u2019s desire to turn the competitive districts from blue to red. And of the 17 Democrats who voted in favor of criminal contempt Thursday, all received campaign contributions from the NRA during the same time and have faced similar Republican campaign committee threats. One Democrat who voted for the contempt charges said he did so on principle, not politics. \u201cThe attorney general was asked to provide information, and he chose not to provide. So as a result, I had no other choice but to vote in contempt,\u201d Democrat and Pennsylvania Rep. Jason Altmire told CNN\u2019s Soledad O\u2019Brien. Still, in this year\u2019s ultracompetitive seats \u2013 particularly those that have been subject to redistricting \u2013 a nod from the NRA for a Democrat could make the difference between re-election and retirement. The NRA raised the stakes of the vote for members in competitive districts when the organization announced that it would score the vote \u2013 or publicly count any vote against holding Holder in contempt as a mark against a lawmaker seeking re-election. Out of those seeking re-election who voted in favor of contempt, more than half are listed in competitive districts by the Cook Political Report and rely on conservative support, including endorsements from the NRA, to survive their tough political battles. Efforts to seek comment from the NRA were not successful. Of the 26 Democrat members in the House who received money from the NRA in 2012, the 12 who abstained or voted against contempt do not have notably competitive races, a CNN analysis found. \u201c(The contempt vote) is a fairly low-cost way to demonstrate independence from your own party. The vote was going to pass anyway, so why not take the opportunity to say you can buck your own party,\u201d said Dave Wasserman, House race editor at the Cook Report. No criminal prosecution of Holder for contempt \u201cDemocrats in those types of districts love to have an NRA endorsement because it bolsters their standing with a demographic they need to cut into to survive,\u201d Wasserman said. Among them is Rep. John Barrow, D-Georgia, who is facing perhaps the toughest re-election campaign out of the 435 House seats up for election come November. Barrow, one of the few white Southern Democrats left, found himself in a more conservative district after the Georgia General Assembly completed a controversial congressional redistricting process last year that left 12 Democratic seats more uncertain than they were last election. In addition to the NRA\u2019s influential endorsement listed on his website, Barrow received $9,900 in 2010 and $4,000 this year in PAC-to-PAC contributions from the gun rights organization. The 26 Democrats to whom the organization contributed during the 2012 election cycle have received an average of about $2,100, totaling $54,450, according figures collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. Barrow declined a request for comment but released a statement before the vote depoliticizing his support. \u201cFor me, this investigation has been about justice for Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and his family,\u201d Barrow said. \u201cThe only way to get to the bottom of what happened is for the Department of Justice to turn over the remaining documents, so that we can work together to ensure this tragedy never happens again.\u201d There is no doubt that Barrow is a Republican target. Fast and Furious investigation started with agent\u2019s death \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear \u2026 that these Democrats are going to do everything they can between now and November to distance themselves from the administration and the unpopular agenda,\u201d National Republican Campaign Committee Press Secretary Paul Lindsay said. Democratic leaders, meanwhile, aren\u2019t standing still. The DCCC launched Monday a campaign of its own to target House Republicans in key races this fall, highlighting their votes against health care reform. They will unleash a torrent of live and robo-calls, hitting 10 GOP House races where they perceive vulnerability \u2014 including Rep. Dan Lungren and Rep. Mary Bono Mack of California, Rep. Judy Biggert of Illinois and Rep. Chris Gibson of New York. And all 10 voted to hold Holder in contempt. For four-term congressman Altmire, he said he was being consistent in his vote against Holder, using the same strategy he touted during the 2010 election and in campaign ads. \u201cToo many people in Congress just tote the party line. Jason Altmire isn\u2019t like that.\u201d his ad said. \u201cNo doubt about it. You saw he voted against health care. Jason opposed the Wall Street bailout. I think Jason is not afraid to stand up to the president. And Nancy Pelosi. He fights for folks here,\u201d the ad continued. Altmire, who lost a primary battle to colleague Rep. Mark Critz after redistricting landed the pair in the same district, told O\u2019Brien that he voted in favor of contempt because it was consistent with his vote to hold Bush administration White House Counsel Harriet Miers in contempt in 2008. Miers refused to show up for a congressional subpoena or to hand over documents relating to the firing of a large number of U.S. attorneys. \u201cI don\u2019t like to play those kind of political games. I stayed consistent with the vote I cast in 2008.\u201d Approximately half of the Democrats who voted in favor of contempt also voted against health care reform, including Barrow; Rep. Ben Chandler, D-Kentucky; Rep. Larry Kissell, D-North Carolina; Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah; Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-North Carolina; Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minnesota; and Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas. \u201cIn some cases, it\u2019s a heartfelt vote, but in most cases, it\u2019s political survival,\u201d Wasserman said of the votes embattled lawmakers make across the aisle.

            "article_content": "The Justice Department cites the president's executive privilege in the case The U.S. House cited Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress Democrats protested the contempt citation as a political move The dispute involves documents in Fast and Furious failed weapons crackdown The White House and the Justice Department made clear Friday what had been expected all along: Attorney General Eric Holder will not face criminal prosecution under the contempt of Congress citation passed by the U.S. House. Legal experts noted this week in the runup to Thursday\u2019s House vote that President Barack Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege in the case would prevent a criminal prosecution under a practice dating to the Reagan administration. The House also cited Holder for civil contempt to give it the option of filing a lawsuit compelling Holder to turn over documents sought by Oversight Committee investigators linked to the failed Operation Fast and Furious weapons crackdown. Such a case was expected to take years to complete. A letter Friday from the Justice Department to House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, who led the investigation that brought the contempt charge against Holder, explained that \u201cacross administrations of both political parties, the longstanding position of the Department of Justice has been and remains that we will not prosecute\u201d in such a circumstance. Rep. Mica calls for Holder resignation House holds Holder in contempt Dems decry contempt vote's 'skunktivity' \u201cThe department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\u201d concluded the letter from Deputy Attorney General James Cole. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the same thing Friday, saying \u201cit is an established principle, dating back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, that the Justice Department does not pursue prosecution in a contempt case when the president has asserted executive privilege.\u201d Fast and Furious investigation started with agent\u2019s death A spokesman for Issa\u2019s committee and another top congressional Republican, veteran Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, complained Friday that the refusal to prosecute showed a lack of independence by the U.S. attorney who would handle the case. \u201cIt is regrettable that the political leadership of the Justice Department is trying to intervene in an effort to prevent the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia from making an independent decision about whether to prosecute this case,\u201d said Frederick Hill, the panel\u2019s director of communications. Obama asserted executive privilege on some documents sought by Issa\u2019s committee in its investigation of Operation Fast and Furious. The executive privilege assertion prevented the documents from being turned over on the grounds that they include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. AME Church likens Congress\u2019s Holder vote to \u2018evil strategies\u2019 following Reconstruction The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. It followed similar programs started in the Bush administration. However, Fast and Furious lost track of more than 1,000 firearms it was tracking, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa, R-California, and Republicans contend that Holder and the Justice Department are concealing details of how Fast and Furious was approved and managed. Democrats argue that Issa and his GOP colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and, by extension, the president in an election year. The showdown between Issa and Holder over the program dates to subpoenas issued last year by the House committee seeking a wide range of documents and other materials. Eventually, the committee reduced its demand to focus on documents involving decision-making after the Fast and Furious program was shut down. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history In particular, the committee wanted internal documents relating to the period after February 2011, when the Justice Department sent Congress an erroneous letter \u2013 later withdrawn \u2013 that said top officials knew nothing about Fast and Furious until early that year. On Wednesday, Issa conceded that investigators lack any evidence that Holder knew of the failed weapons-tracking tactics of Fast and Furious. The contempt citation, he said, was for Holder\u2019s failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents. \u201cIt\u2019s not for what the attorney general knew about Fast and Furious,\u201d Issa said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the attorney general\u2019s refusal to provide the documents.\u201d Carney said Friday that Issa\u2019s comment showed the contempt citation was about politics. \u201cRemarkably, the chairman of the committee involved here has asserted that he has no evidence that the attorney general knew of operation Fast and Furious or did anything but take the right action when he learned of it. No evidence,\u201d Carney said. \u201cSo if you have no evidence, as he\u2019s stated now about the White House and the attorney general, what else could this be than politics?\u201d In Thursday\u2019s vote on criminal contempt, House Republicans were joined by 17 Democrats in citing Holder, while dozens of Democrats walked out in protest.

            "article_content": "Nevada's rapid population growth has diluted Mormon influence on elections Impact of Mormon voters is felt most in Republican races GOP strategists hope that LDS vote will be enough to tip tight election Romney's Mormon backers are tapping into church network to build support In 1986, with control of the United States Senate up for grabs, The Economist dispatched a reporter to Nevada, an important battleground that year, to survey the race between then-Rep. Harry Reid and his Republican opponent, James Santini. \u201cMr. Reid\u2019s performance in Las Vegas could well turn on the Mormon vote,\u201d the correspondent noted, spotlighting Reid\u2019s religion. \u201cThough only some 12% of Nevadans are Mormons, they punch more than their weight. Less than half the state\u2019s eligible voters bother to register, but Mormons almost always do, which gives them about a quarter of the likely turnout.\u201d Members of the Jesus Christ Church of Latter Day Saints still punch more than their weight in Nevada politics, holding a broad array of elected offices and deep sway within the business community. But the portrait of Nevada as a sparsely populated desert locale where elections hinge on the Mormon vote now seems quaint. The state\u2019s dramatic population growth over the last two decades \u2013 two-thirds of all registered voters in Nevada registered to vote after the 2000 presidential election, for instance \u2013 has diluted the influence of Mormon voters on statewide elections. Nevada had just 375,000 registered voters in 1998 when Reid won his first Senate race. Now, more than a million voters are on the books. There are nearly 700,000 voters in Clark County alone. At the same time the state\u2019s population was exploding, Nevada\u2019s Mormon population slipped from 12% in 1986 to an estimated 7% today. Mormon vote \u2018almost always over-hyped\u2019 Michele Bachmann on being VP Romney, Obama vie for fundraising edge Romney buys supporter new truck Although Mitt Romney is certain to energize Mormon voters this election season as the first member of his church to helm a major party\u2019s presidential ticket, political watchers here say the LDS vote in Nevada rarely lives up to its billing in the national media. \u201cThe Mormon vote here is almost always over-hyped,\u201d said veteran Las Vegas Sun columnist Jon Ralston. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a huge factor unless the election here is very, very close, because you have to assume that 90% to 95% of them are going to vote for Romney. But it\u2019s still relatively insignificant compared to other demographics, like Hispanics.\u201d The impact of LDS voters is felt mostly inside the Republican Party, a dynamic that came into focus during the GOP primary fight, when Mormons showed up at polling places in robust numbers to help push Romney to victories in Western states like Wyoming, Idaho and Arizona. In exit polls conducted during the Nevada caucuses in February, 25% of the electorate identified as Mormon, and nearly all of them voted for Romney. A similar story unfolded during the caucuses in 2008, when Romney first ran for president. The state does not keep tabs on voter registration by faith, and religious affiliation was not exit-polled during the 2008 or 2010 elections. Strategists in both parties, though, operate under the assumption that the Mormon share of the vote drops off sharply in Nevada\u2019s general elections, and that most of their support goes to GOP candidates. Republicans and Democrats in Nevada, including members of the church, agree that Mormon voters can no longer swing a statewide election on their own. But Republicans hope that in a tight election \u2013 as the presidential race is expected to be in Nevada and the small number of states that will decide the election \u2013 even the slightest uptick in Mormon turnout with Romney on top of the ticket could provide an edge. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a close state, so whatever difference you can make up somewhere is going to be very important,\u201d said Danny Tarkanian, the Republican candidate in Nevada\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Most of Nevada\u2019s Mormons live in and around Clark County, the most populous in the state. They are also prevalent in rural communities in the southern part of the state and in the east along the Utah border, precincts that usually vote Republican. Mormons register and vote at higher rates Former Nevada Gov. Bob List, a Republican, said Mormons tend to register to vote and participate in elections at higher rates than other demographic groups, usually to the GOP\u2019s benefit. \u201cThere are Mormon Democrats, Harry Reid being Exhibit A, but of those who are LDS, most tend to be Republicans, and they are quite cohesive in their voting patterns,\u201d List said. \u201cThey always have a significant turnout compared to the voting public, giving them an additional piece of power and influence. They are a force, and I think they will be very helpful to Gov. Romney in the end.\u201d Political observers here are quick to point out that the economy \u2013 not faith, gender or race \u2013 is the central issue for Nevada voters, as it is in other key states. Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate is 11.6%, the nation\u2019s highest. The foreclosure crisis devastated suburban communities in the state, and Democrats have eagerly seized on Romney\u2019s interview with the Las Vegas Review Journal last October, when he said he preferred to let the housing market \u201crun its course and hit bottom\u201d instead of intervening to help homeowners. But few here expect external factors to dampen Romney\u2019s support among Mormon voters. There are also a number of Mormon candidates running for office this year up and down the ballot, which may spur church members to show up in greater numbers come November. Sen. Dean Heller, whose re-election fight against Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley is among the most closely watched Senate races in the country, is a member of the church. There are also five competitive state Senate races that could decide which party controls the upper body of the legislature in Carson City. In four of those races, the Republican candidates are LDS. Romney campaign aides, notoriously guarded when discussing their candidate\u2019s faith, say they are not approaching Mormon voters differently than anyone else. \u201cNevada has been disproportionately hurt by President Obama\u2019s policies,\u201d said Ryan Erwin, Romney\u2019s top adviser in the state. \u201cRegardless of your age or gender or religious affiliation or geographic location, within this state you have been touched in a negative way by some Obama policy.\u201d Mormon backers build support for former bishop But the official line from Romney-world isn\u2019t stopping his Mormon supporters from tapping into their own ready-made church networks \u2013 which are organized locally into wards, stakes or branches \u2013 to build support for the former Massachusetts governor, who was once a bishop in Boston suburb of Belmont. Dave Isbell, a Clark County Mormon who was active in Ron Paul\u2019s campaign but said he is nonetheless \u201cpretty proud\u201d of Romney, said several of his fellow church members are cross-checking church directories with voter registration data to identify and contact potential Romney backers. Isbell said a popular smartphone app called LDS Tools, which lists phone numbers and addresses for local stake members, has become a reliable resource for enterprising Romney volunteers doing voter outreach, despite church rules that forbid the use of LDS resources for political purposes. \u201cThe church makes it really easy for you to get a hold of anyone in your ward,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cIf you are a Romney supporter in the church, you have an opportunity to talk to everyone in your ward that already has a relationship of trust with you.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m sure the campaigns and the church are saying \u2018you can\u2019t do that,\u2019 but people will fall on their sword for Mitt Romney and some people will justify the means.\u201d Romney\u2019s support among Mormons may also be felt in Nevada outside the voting booth. Romney supporters traveled all the way to Iowa and South Carolina from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, to assist in the victory effort during the primaries \u2013 and Republicans expect that to happen again this fall, particularly in the Western swing states of Nevada and Colorado. Several Nevada Republicans told CNN they are counting on a flood of Mormon volunteers from reliably red Utah and reliably blue California to travel into Nevada for the get-out-the-vote effort. One LDS member involved in election planning, who did not want to be identified revealing party strategy, said the arrival of out-of-state Mormons in Nevada \u201cwill happen in a huge way\u201d this fall. Another veteran Republican operative in the state who was not authorized by his organization to speak on the record said Mormon volunteers will be a fundamental part of the Romney ground game in Nevada. \u201cYou tell them to be there at 8 a.m., and they are there at 7:55,\u201d said the operative. \u201cRomney is their guy. They are committed.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A collection of reaction from various groups and individuals to the House of Representatives vote Thursday holding Attorney General Eric Holder in criminal and civil contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents related to the Fast and Furious gun-running sting: Attorney General Eric Holder: \u201cToday\u2019s vote is the regrettable culmination of what became a misguided \u2013 and politically motivated \u2013 investigation during an election year.  By advancing it over the past year and a half, Congressman (Darrell) Issa and others have focused on politics over public safety.  Instead of trying to correct the problems that led to a series of flawed law enforcement operations, and instead of helping us find ways to better protect the brave law enforcement officers, like Agent Brian Terry, who keep us safe \u2013 they have led us to this unnecessary and unwarranted outcome.\u201d The White House: House holds Holder in contempt Dems decry contempt vote's 'skunktivity' Rep. Mica calls for Holder resignation \u201cAt the beginning of this year, Republicans announced one of their top priorities was to investigate the administration and to ensure that President Obama was a one-term president. Despite the major economic challenges facing the country, they talked openly about devoting taxpayer-funded, Congressional oversight resources to political purposes \u2026 In an act of good faith, this week the administration made an additional offer which would have resulted in the committee getting unprecedented access to documents dispelling any notion of an intent to mislead. But unfortunately, a politically-motivated agenda prevailed and instead of engaging with the president in efforts to create jobs and grow the economy, today we saw the House of Representatives perform a transparently political stunt.\u201d Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights: Attorney General Eric Holder is an exemplary public servant \u2013 and this reckless and wrong-headed vote doesn\u2019t change that. Anyone who has followed these proceedings over the last several weeks and months knows that the attorney general is not in contempt of Congress; rather, he is in contempt of the narrow partisan agenda of some in the House leadership. The fact that this vote is tied to the political whims of the National Rifle Association is nothing short of absurd. A contempt citation from Congress is a historic sanction that should not be invoked on such frivolous grounds. Ben Jealous, president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People: \u201cToday\u2019s contempt vote was a divisive political maneuver that does nothing to advance justice. Attorney General Holder has been candid about the botched Fast and Furious program and has handed over more than 7,000 documents related to the operation started under his predecessor. It is reprehensible that this sitting attorney general and distinguished legal advocate is being attacked by some in Congress for political gain.\u201d Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u201cThe U.S. House of Representatives today sent a clear message that it will not allow the Obama administration to hide its lawless, reckless and deadly actions from the American public. The American people deserve to know what they are hiding, how high this lawlessness goes and why the president\u2019s lawyer and best friend is stonewalling. I have long called for General Holder\u2019s resignation over his involvement in the botched Fast and Furious scandal that led to the tragic death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. General Holder\u2019s blatant attempts to mislead members of Congress and the American people, paired with his relentless crusade to erode states\u2019 rights, have cost him the trust of this nation, and must be stopped. \u201c Robert Heyer, chairman of the Brian Terry Foundation and cousin of slain Border Patrol agent Brian Terry: \u201cThe Terry family takes no pleasure in the contempt vote against Attorney General Eric Holder. Such a vote should not have been necessary. The Justice Department should have released the documents related to Fast and Furious months ago. Eric Holder\u2019s refusal to do so and President Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege have stood in the way of justice and the answers we seek into the death of fallen Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Given the Obama administration\u2019s steadfast refusal to level with the American people, Congress was left with no choice but to vote Mr. Holder in contempt.\u201d Read the Congressional Resolution Read the full contempt report The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal",

Mica calls for Holder resignation Attorney General Holder held in contempt Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history Legal experts contacted by CNN have said, based on recent precedent, that it could take years for the courts to reach any final decision in the civil case. Fast and Furious, a so-called \u201cgun-walking\u201d operation, allowed roughly 2,000 guns into Mexico with the goal of tracking them to Mexican drug cartels.

Guns from the operation have also been linked to an unknown number of Mexican civilians\u2019 deaths. GOP leaders say the documents they seek are needed to get to the circumstances surrounding Terry\u2019s death.  Democrats insist the Republican-led probe is all about politics.  Thursday\u2019s vote came two days after House Republicans rejected the latest offer by the White House and Justice Department to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators in exchange for dropping the contempt measures. A senior House Republican aide told CNN the offer was insufficient. In the hours leading up to the criminal contempt vote, Republicans repeatedly insisted that they were exercising proper legislative oversight of the executive branch and seeking answers for Terry\u2019s family. \u201cIn the real world Americans are expected to comply with subpoenas.

They also claim he has been demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas Holder is accused of violating.

            "article_content": "The House will likely vote Thursday to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt Recent history indicates the contempt vote won't have serious legal consequences Democrats say the contempt vote -- tied to Operation Fast and Furious -- is all about politics Republicans say the contempt vote is about proper legislative oversight Washington\u2019s uproar over the infamous Operation Fast and Furious gun-running sting will likely hit its political climax Thursday as the House of Representatives votes to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt. But beyond the political symbolism of such a vote \u2013 no attorney general has ever been held in contempt by Congress \u2013 what exactly does it mean?  Where does the case go from here? If modern history is any guide, it won\u2019t go very far. Holder contempt vote sign of \u2018broken\u2019 Washington? The GOP-controlled House is actually set to hold two votes: one for criminal contempt and another authorizing civil action. Holder contempt vote seems inevitable NRA watching Holder contempt vote The criminal contempt charge would refer the entire dispute to District of Columbia U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, who would then decide whether to file criminal charges against Holder or others, based on the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to hand over information sought by House Republicans. If you sense a possible conflict of interest here, you\u2019re not alone. Machen was appointed to his job by President Barack Obama. Holder\u2019s his boss. Most legal observers expect Machen to do nothing. They note that President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department refused to take any action after a Democratic-controlled House voted in early 2008 to hold then-White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers in contempt for actions relating to the controversial dismissal of several U.S. prosecutors. They also note Obama\u2019s use of executive privilege to prevent the release of certain documents in the Fast and Furious case \u2013 a move which typically makes executive branch officials immune from criminal prosecution. House Republicans are well aware of this recent history, which helps explain the separate measure authorizing a civil action. That resolution, according to a GOP spokesman, would allow the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to file a lawsuit asking the courts to examine the Justice Department\u2019s failure to produce certain subpoenaed documents, as well as the validity of the administration\u2019s assertion of executive privilege. The committee is led by GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California, Holder\u2019s chief congressional nemesis. Specifically, Issa\u2019s panel is seeking documents showing why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that denied any major flaws in Operation Fast and Furious. Holder has repeatedly refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama last week to assert executive privilege over such documents. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history The goal of the civil action \u2013 beyond continued political embarrassment to a president in the middle of a tough re-election campaign \u2013 would be to compel Justice Department officials and their political allies in the White House to hand over the documents in question. But Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz, a legislative expert and former federal clerk, says any judicial proceedings relating to the civil action will likely take years and outlast any political interest in the case. \u201cJust by going to court, the House guarantees it loses.  Even if (the House) wins, it\u2019s going to be years from now,\u201d Chafetz told CNN.  \u201cThis Congress will be out of office and Obama may be out of office.  If they wind up going to court, it will actually be to the great detriment of the House\u2019s oversight role.\u201d Chafetz noted that House Democrats also pursued the case against Miers and Bolten in court, finally reaching a compromise settlement after Bush left office in 2009.  By that point, few people cared. The Democrats \u201cgot some of the documents they wanted and some of the testimony they wanted,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the timing was so unfortunate for the House, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening this time.\u201d Stan Brand, a top Washington lawyer and former general counsel to the House under Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill, predicted \u201ctwo or two-plus years of protracted, arduous litigation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll hear about it again in 2014,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cI think it\u2019s fine to go to court and try to vindicate your interest, but this isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Alberto Gonzales on SCOTUS & Holder Vote Justice program allowed guns into Mexico Fast and Furious, a so-called \u201cgun-walking\u201d operation, allowed roughly 2,000 guns into Mexico with the goal of tracking them to Mexican drug cartels. Two guns found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry\u2019s fatal shooting were linked to the operation. Guns from the operation have also been linked to an unknown number of Mexican civilians\u2019 deaths. Republicans say the documents they seek are needed to get to the circumstances around Terry\u2019s death.  Democrats are crying foul, and insist the GOP probe is all about politics. \u201cHouse Republicans have made the strategic choice to try to score political points,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney argued Wednesday.  They are \u201cfocusing their time and attention on a law enforcement operation from 2009 that was botched and that everyone agrees was botched.\u201d The Republicans have \u201cmade that choice rather than focusing on jobs and the economy.\u201d For their part, House GOP leaders insist they are merely holding the executive branch accountable for its actions \u2013 a core constitutional function of Congress. The Justice Department has \u201cacknowledged that it made false claims to Congress about this reckless operation,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week.  \u201cThe Obama administration, however, (has) stonewalled Congress\u2019s legitimate oversight responsibilities. \u2026 The American people deserve the truth and the administration has an obligation to turn over the relevant documents right now.\u201d Political analysts are sharply divided over the merits of the GOP\u2019s case and its potential political fallout. \u201cI think, for a lot of Americans who don\u2019t understand the complexities and really don\u2019t care about \u2026 this, I think it is one more illustration, as if we needed any more, that Washington is broken,\u201d veteran political analyst David Gergen said earlier this month on CNN. \u201cIf people conclude yet once again those guys really cannot run the country, it is very discouraging.\u201d Boehner: Contempt vote on Holder will proceed CNN\u2019s Allison Brennan, Tom Cohen, and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "\"We're going to proceed,\" Speaker Boehner says The House Rules Committee sets the procedure for Thursday's debate The House is scheduled to vote on holding Attorney General Holder in contempt At issue is whether Holder complied with a subpoena from congressional investigators The U.S. House will vote Thursday on holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for withholding documents involving the failed Fast and Furious weapons crackdown, Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to proceed,\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve given them ample opportunity to reply.\u201d Late Wednesday, the House Rules Committee approved the procedure for Thursday\u2019s debate and vote, which could bring the unprecedented contempt citation of a sitting attorney general. The move came the day after House Republicans rejected the latest offer by the White House and Justice Department to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators. Administration and justice officials met Tuesday with senior aides to Boehner and House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, to try to head off the House vote. However, a senior House Republican aide said an offer to let congressional investigators see some of the requested documents in return for dropping the contempt measure was insufficient. A group of House Democrats, led by the Congressional Black Caucus, said it was planning to walk out of the House chamber on Thursday and boycott the vote. NRA watching Holder contempt vote In a letter to House members that was still being circulated late Wednesday for signatures, the Democrats opposed to voting on the GOP-sponsored resolutions said, \u201cContempt power should be used sparingly, carefully and only in the most egregious situations. The Republican Leadership has articulated no legislative purpose for pursuing this course of action. For these reasons we cannot and will not participate in a vote to hold the Attorney General in contempt.\u201d Boehner defends Holder contempt vote The letter went on to say the signers would refuse to participate in any vote that \u201cwould tarnish the image of Congress or of an Attorney General who has done nothing but work tirelessly to protect the rights of the American people. We must reflect upon why we are elected to this body and choose now to stand up for justice.\u201d Contempt for Holder story? A senior Democratic aide told CNN that, in addition to the Black Caucus, which includes more than 40 members, the Hispanic Caucus, the Asian-Pacific American Caucus, and the Progressive Caucus may also participate.  It was unclear whether any Democratic leaders would join the boycott. The move would mirror a similar walkout by House Republicans in 2008, when Democrats, who then controlled the House, voted to hold two top Bush Administration officials in contempt of Congress. The ranking Democrat on the oversight committee called Wednesday for Boehner to try to work out a solution with Holder instead of holding a vote on Thursday. \u201cWhy are we steamrolling ahead on a matter of such gravity?\u201d asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. \u201cIn my opinion the answer is plain and simple: politics.\u201d There was no word Wednesday whether Cummings would participate in the planned boycott. In a letter to Boehner, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, asked him to reconsider his decision to bring the contempt citation to the floor. \u201cHolding the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement officer in contempt of Congress would be a drastic, disproportionate action on the part of this body,\u201d she wrote. Fast and Furious investigation started with agent\u2019s death President Barack Obama has asserted executive privilege on some documents in the dispute, preventing them from being turned over on grounds they include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the Justice Department also offered to conduct a briefing, give Congress documents related to whistle-blowers in the case and work with the committee to respond to any questions it may have had after reviewing the materials. \u201cThis was a good-faith effort to try to reach an accommodation while still protecting the institutional prerogatives of the executive branch, often championed by these same Republicans criticizing us right now,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz told CNN. \u201cUnfortunately, Republicans have opted for political theater rather than conduct legitimate congressional oversight.\u201d Boehner, however, said Wednesday that a failure to cooperate by the Obama administration had forced House Republicans to take up the contempt measure. Republicans on the House Oversight Committee last week recommended citing Holder. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. It followed similar programs started in the Bush administration. However, Fast and Furious lost track of more than 1,000 firearms it was tracking in the operation, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa and Republicans contend that Holder and the Justice Department are concealing details of how Operation Fast and Furious was approved and managed. Democrats argue that Issa and his GOP colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and, by extension, the president in an election year. The showdown between Issa and Holder over the program dates back to subpoenas issued last year by the House committee. At the Rules Committee meeting Wednesday, Issa conceded that investigators lack any evidence that Holder knew of the failed weapons-tracking tactics of Fast and Furious. The contempt citation, he said, was for Holder\u2019s failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents. \u201cIt\u2019s not for what the attorney general knew about Fast and Furious,\u201d Issa said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the attorney general\u2019s refusal to provide the documents.\u201d Issa, White House clash over Fast and Furious executive privilege Cummings and other Democrats contended that Issa conducted an improper investigation of Holder and Operation Fast and Furious. They complained the chairman refused to let witnesses proposed by Democrats give public testimony and was demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas Holder is accused of violating. A video released Tuesday by Democrats on Issa\u2019s panel showed the chairman making past allegations of White House links to Fast and Furious, juxtaposed with Issa saying Sunday there was no evidence of a White House cover-up. Some gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, maintain that the program that allowed hundreds of weapons, including assault rifles, to end up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels was a way for the Obama administration to press for new gun-control laws. Issa said Sunday he had e-mails showing the administration planned to point to the operation and push for a \u201cweapons ban or greater reporting.\u201d However, Cummings pushed back at Issa\u2019s claim Tuesday, telling reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that, and I think it\u2019s very unfortunate that people are coming up with these theories.\u201d Democratic leaders in the House concede that some Democrats could join with Republicans to hold Holder in contempt, citing pressure from the NRA. \u201cThere\u2019s been no polling of our membership on how they will respond to the NRA, but suffice it to say certainly that the NRA is a major force\u201d in Washington, Rep. John Larson, D-Connecticut, told reporters Wednesday. He predicted the \u201cstrong majority\u201d of the Democratic caucus would oppose the contempt measure. The committee vote last week was on strict party lines, with Republicans supporting a contempt recommendation and Democrats opposing it. The vote occurred before the gun lobby formally registered its support for the contempt resolution. Rarely has any pro-gun-rights Democrat representing a rural and Southern district broken with the NRA\u2019s position on key votes, especially in an election year. \u201cThe reason we support the contempt resolution is the same reason we first called for Attorney General Holder\u2019s resignation more than a year ago: the Department\u2019s obstruction of congressional oversight of a program that costs lives in support of an anti-gun agenda,\u201d said a letter to Issa last week from NRA Executive Director Chris Cox. The NRA, which frequently weighs in on congressional races with endorsements and support of a national grassroots network, also warned of electoral consequences for anyone voting against the contempt measure. \u201cThis is an issue of utmost seriousness, and the NRA will consider this vote in our future candidate evaluations,\u201d the organization said. Opinion: Don\u2019t be nosy about Fast and Furious House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said last week that Republicans were targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. On Wednesday, Larson chastised Republicans for pushing ahead on the contempt vote as part of a strategy to prevent economic progress and harm Obama\u2019s re-election chances in November. \u201cThis is just all part of a continuing plan, and whether it\u2019s suppressing the vote or suppressing the economy \u2013 this obstructionist regime that we see that continues to block because they think they would rather see President Obama fail than the nation succeed,\u201d Larson said. Issa\u2019s panel has been seeking documents that show why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate the February 2011 letter. However, Holder has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama to assert executive privilege over such documents last week.

            "article_content": "NEW: A video by House Democrats mocks the Republican investigation The White House cites precedents on executive privilege Rep. Darrell Issa calls the executive privilege assertion \"surprising\" Fast and Furious, a botched gun-running sting, has been widely criticized A war of words continued Tuesday over the possible contempt of Congress vote against  Attorney General Eric Holder later this week, with the White House citing past examples of presidents claiming executive privilege in similar disputes over documents. The White House response followed a letter Monday night from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, that slammed President Barack Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege in the panel\u2019s probe of the botched Fast and Furious gun running sting. With the House scheduled to vote Thursday on the contempt measure against Holder, the White House fired back against Issa with a list of past cases in which presidents asserted executive privilege for the same kinds of documents sought by Issa\u2019s committee. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that House Republicans have made the dispute a political issue, while another spokesman, Eric Schultz, ridiculed Issa\u2019s analysis of the executive privilege claim by Obama. Issa\u2019s panel has been seeking documents that show why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about the Fast and Furious operation. However, Holder has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama to assert executive privilege over such documents last week. In his letter Monday, Issa said Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege means that he and his most senior advisers were involved in \u201cmanaging\u201d Fast and Furious and the \u201cfallout from it\u201d or that the president asserted a power he knows is unjustified \u201cfor the purpose of further obstructing a congressional investigation.\u201d \u201cTo date, the White House has steadfastly maintained that it has not had any role in advising the (Justice) Department with respect to the congressional investigation. The surprising assertion of executive privilege raised the question of whether that is still the case,\u201d Issa said in his letter. Schultz responded that Issa\u2019s account \u201chas as much merit as his absurd contention that Operation Fast and Furious was created in order to promote gun control.\u201d \u201cOur position is consistent with executive branch legal precedent for the past three decades spanning administrations of both parties, and dating back to President Reagan\u2019s Department of Justice,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cThe courts have routinely considered deliberative process privilege claims and affirmed the right of the executive branch to invoke the privilege even when White House documents are not involved.\u201d A supporting document provided by Schultz listed five such cases, including an October 1981 assertion by Reagan involving documents describing internal deliberations inside the Department of the Interior and another by Reagan a year later involving internal Environmental Protection Agency files. Republicans on Issa\u2019s committee approved the contempt measure against Holder for refusing to hand over all of the requested documents in the panel\u2019s investigation of the operation run by the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The vote last week came after Obama asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel. The White House move means the Department of Justice can withhold some of the documents. Opinion: Don\u2019t be nosy about Fast and Furious A brief history of 'Fast and Furious' Justice program allowed guns into Mexico Grassley: We've been stonewalled Cummings: Obama had no choice The ATF launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. If the House passes the contempt measure Thursday, it would be the first time in history a sitting U.S. attorney general was cited for contempt of Congress. \u201cI urge you to reconsider the decision to withhold documents that would allow Congress to complete its investigation,\u201d Issa said in his letter. \u201cI remain hopeful that the Attorney General will produce the specified documents so that we can work towards resolving this matter short of a contempt citation.\u201d By the numbers: Fast and Furious The showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year. Issa and Republicans contend that Holder and the Justice Department are concealing details of how Operation Fast and Furious was approved and managed. Democrats argue that Issa and his GOP colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and, by extension, the president in an election year. A video released Tuesday by Democrats on Issa\u2019s panel showed the chairman making past allegations of White House links to Fast and Furious, juxtaposed with Issa saying Sunday there was no evidence of a White House cover-up. \u201cGet the facts. Read the report,\u201d the video says in conclusion. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, alleged last week that Republicans were targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. Issa, however, said in his letter that the assertion of executive privilege \u201craises more questions than it answers.\u201d The letter provided details of a June 19 meeting between Issa and Holder on the eve of the committee\u2019s partisan vote on the contempt measure. Issa said Holder wanted to \u201cbuy peace\u201d on the matter. \u201cHe indicated a willingness to produce the \u2018fair compilation\u2019 of post-February 4th documents.  He told me that he would provide the \u2018fair compilation\u2019 of documents on three conditions: (1) that I permanently cancel the contempt vote; (2) that I agree the department was in full compliance with the committee\u2019s subpoenas, and; (3) that I accept the \u2018fair compilation,\u2019 sight unseen,\u201d Issa said in the letter, calling Holder\u2019s conditions \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s conditional offer of a \u2018fair compilation\u2019 of a subset of documents covered by the subpoena, and your assertion of executive privilege, in no way substitute for the fact that the Justice Department is still grossly deficient in its compliance with the committee\u2019s subpoena,\u201d Issa\u2019s letter said. \u201cBy the department\u2019s own admission, it has withheld more than 130,000 pages of responsive documents.\u201d Issa also stressed the importance of forging a settlement rather than pursuing contempt of Congress proceedings, and asked the White House for answers to questions about the executive privilege assertion. \u201cTo what extent were you or your most senior advisers involved in Operation Fast and Furious and the fallout from it, including the false February 4, 2011 letter provided by the attorney general to the committee?\u201d Issa\u2019s letter said. \u201cPlease also identify any communications, meetings, and teleconferences between the White House and the Justice Department between February 4, 2011 and June 18, 2012, the day before the Attorney General requested that you assert executive privilege.\u201d Fast and Furious investigation started with agent\u2019s death",

The letter will be sent later Sunday or Monday, Issa, R-California, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d The oversight committee voted Wednesday to refer a potential contempt citation against Attorney General Eric Holder to the full House, which is set to vote this week. \u201cWe\u2019re past that part of the discovery, relative to contempt, Issa said. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of wrong things and we want to fix it. What we\u2019re talking about now, when we get lied to, when the American people get lied to, there can\u2019t be oversight when there\u2019s lying. \u201cThe Supreme Court held pretty clearly there cannot be executive privilege over a criminal cover-up,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Lying to Congress is a crime. We have every right to see documents to say, \u2018Did you know?\u2019 \u2018What did you know?\u2019 including even the president.\u201d However, he added, \u201cIf we get documents that do show, cast some doubt, or allow us to understand this, we\u2019ll at least delay contempt and continue the process. We only broke off negotiations when we got a flat refusal when we asked to get information needed for our investigation.\u201d If the documents say what Holder claims they say, \u201cwe might dismiss contempt,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland and the ranking member of the oversight committee, called on House Speaker John Boehner to meet with Holder to resolve the dispute. \u201cI\u2019m calling on Speaker Boehner to come forth and show the strong leadership that I know he will, and sit down with the attorney general to resolve this matter,\u201d Cummings said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe attorney general has made it clear that he is willing to work with this Congress.\u201d Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege over some of the documents sought by the panel means the Justice Department can withhold specified materials. White House spokesman Jay Carney has called the Republican investigation a \u201cpolitically motivated, taxpayer funded, election year fishing expedition.\u201d And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has said Republicans are targeting Hlder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. Holder said on Thursday his offer to turn over some of the documents sought by House Republicans still stands. But Issa told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that absent the documents, the full House will vote Holder in contempt. A number of Democrats have appealed to the administration to be forthcoming, he said, and \u201cmany of them will stay with us.\u201d Last week\u2019s events heightened the drama of the high-profile showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program, which dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year.

            "article_content": "Contempt vote and executive privilege escalated Fast and Furious skirmish Gergen: Back-and-forth shows Washington is \"broken\" Floor vote would make Holder first attorney general held in contempt It's not about Fast and Furious, but whether Democracy still works, Gergen said What had been brewing as a low-level skirmish for more than a year became a full-on political brawl, further feeding the perception that politics trump policy, when a House committee voted along party lines to cite Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress. \u201cI think for a lot of Americans who don\u2019t understand the complexities and really don\u2019t care about \u2026 this, I think it is one more illustration, as if we needed any more, that Washington is broken,\u201d CNN Contributor David Gergen said on \u201cJohn King, USA\u201d on Wednesday.  Americans instead, Gergen said, are more interested in job creation. The vote comes after an effort, which began in February 2011, to obtain Justice Department documents concerning Operation Fast and Furious, a \u201cgun-walking\u201d operation that allowed more than 1,000 guns to get into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Two guns found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry\u2019s shooting were linked to the operation. Guns from the operation have also been linked to an unknown number of Mexican civilians\u2019 deaths. Holder contempt vote inflames Fast and Furious debate Republicans say the documents they seek are needed to get to the circumstances around the agent\u2019s death. \u201cThis is about getting to the truth for the American people and the Terry family. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not about personalities here,\u201d Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a morning news conference. Democrats say Republicans are trying to score political points in an election year. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the investigation a \u201cpolitically motivated, taxpayer-funded, election-year fishing expedition.\u201d Investigation began with agent\u2019s death A brief history of 'Fast and Furious' Grassley:Fast & Furious 'stupid' program Cummings: Holder contempt about politics Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democratic member on the House Oversight Committee, which voted to cite Holder, joined the chorus against the contempt vote on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point\u201d on Thursday, saying that this was \u201cthe far right at its very best.\u201d \u201cI think you have, once again, the far right of this party pushing and pushing, and I just find it extremely alarming that we have gotten to this point, and it is very unfortunate,\u201d Cummings said. What do you think of the controversy? Frederick Hill, spokesman for House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, defended the investigation, saying  it began well over a year and a half ago, \u201cwhich is as far away from an election year as you could be.\u201d He added that what is suspect is the timing of the executive privilege President Barack Obama extended to Holder for documents the Justice Department previously offered to release. But the fight didn\u2019t have to get this far, Gergen said. \u201cReasonable people should have figured a way to have the information presented to the committee,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cWe have seen such negotiations numerous times in the past. It can be worked out.\u201d It still could be. Holder and Issa indicated they are open to a compromise before the vote next week.  However, if the recommendation of the Oversight Committee is passed by the Republican-controlled House, Holder would be the first attorney general held in contempt of Congress. In the nearest case, former Speaker Newt Gingrich and then-Attorney General Janet Reno worked out a deal over documents related to campaign finance in 1998 before a contempt action was taken to the floor of the House. Why contempt case against Holder may be doomed The potential unprecedented action comes against a backdrop of foundering congressional approval ratings. The most recent CNN/ORC International Poll indicates that 11% of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing. Gergen said this issue extends beyond the potential floor vote on contempt scheduled for next week. \u201cThis is again ultimately about, \u2018Does democracy work in Washington today?\u2019 And if people conclude yet once again those guys really cannot run the country, it is very discouraging and it has ripple effects well beyond the Fast and Furious case.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Grassley says there are \"reams\" of documents withheld by the Justice Department The White House denies any cover-up in the Fast and Furious campaign Speaker Boehner says the White House was involved in Fast and Furious decisions Rep. Pelosi says Republicans target Holder as part of voter suppression efforts A possible U.S. House vote next week on citing Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress in connection with the botched Fast and Furious gun-running sting evoked bitter political sniping Thursday between Republicans and Democrats. Despite statements by all parties favoring a deal to avoid what would be an unprecedented contempt citation against a sitting attorney general, the heated rhetoric indicated congressional leaders and Holder remained committed to deeply rooted stances on the politically charged issue. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, defended the House Oversight Committee vote Wednesday to refer the contempt citation to the full House, saying the goal was to uncover the truth about Fast and Furious, including what he called certain White House involvement. \u201cThe House will vote next week on a contempt measure unless these documents are released,\u201d Boehner said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney called the Republican investigation a \u201cpolitically motivated, taxpayer funded, election year fishing expedition.\u201d \u201cIt is this approach, I think, that explains at least in part why this Congress has the lowest public approval ratings of any in memory, if not history,\u201d Carney said. Holder, meanwhile, said his offer still stands to turn over some of the documents sought by House Republicans. \u201cThe proposal that we have made is still there,\u201d Holder told reporters in Denmark, where he was meeting with European officials. \u201cThe House, I think, has to consider now what the leadership \u2026 will do and so we\u2019ll see how it works out.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s committee vote on the contempt measure was on strict party lines \u2013 with 23 Republicans in favor and 17 Democrats opposing. It ended an extraordinary daylong hearing that took place after President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege over some of the documents sought by the panel investigating Fast and Furious. The White House move means the Justice Department can withhold specified materials. What happens if panel cites Holder for contempt? House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, claimed Republicans are targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. \u201cIt is no coincidence that the attorney general of the United States is the person responsible for making sure that voter suppression does not happen in our country, that issues that relate to the civil liberties of the American people are upheld,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cThese very same people holding him in contempt are part of a nationwide scheme to suppress the vote.\u201d Meanwhile, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association implied on CNN that Fast and Furious was part of a government effort to justify tougher gun control laws. \u201cI believe what this is about and why they won\u2019t release these papers is what Fast and Furious was about was a political attack on the Second Amendment of the United States, to heck with some botched sting operation,\u201d Wayne LaPierre said. \u201c\u2026 I believe these papers will show that they were doing everything to attack the Second Amendment and the gun and hunting states are going to decide this election, and this administration cannot afford that out before the election.\u201d On Wednesday, the chairman of the House panel, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, refused to put off consideration of the measure, saying the White House assertion of executive privilege \u201cfalls short\u201d of any reason to delay the hearing. However, Issa said after the hearing that he believes a settlement to avoid an unprecedented contempt vote in the House is \u201cin the best interest of the Justice Department, Congress and those most directly affected by Operation Fast and Furious.\u201d What do you think of the controversy? In Copenhagen on Thursday, Holder repeated earlier criticism of the House panel\u2019s vote, calling it  \u201cunwarranted, unnecessary and unprecedented.\u201d His offer to Issa, in a meeting Tuesday evening, \u201cwould have allowed for the resolution of that matter, consistent with the way in which these have been resolved in the past through negotiation,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI think the possibility still exists that it can happen in that way.\u201d Holder has said his proposal included turning over some documents and briefing Issa\u2019s committee on them, while also providing an inventory of what requested materials were provided or withheld. He also sought an assurance from Issa that the move would satisfy the subpoenas from the committee. Issa, however, complained that Holder\u2019s offer set unreasonable conditions. Boehner said Thursday that Republicans rejected that \u201cwe should accept some documents of his choosing, and as a result of his turning over some documents of his choosing, that we would never ever pursue contempt.\u201d However, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said, \u201cThis is a situation where an attorney general has cooperated to the nth degree, and the only thing he asked for is that we come to some type of conclusion with regard to this contempt situation.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s developments further heightened the drama of a high-profile showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program that dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapon purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Investigation began with agent\u2019s death Issa\u2019s committee is seeking documents that show why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about Fast and Furious. The subpoenas issued last year originally cited a broad array of documents, including wiretap requests and other materials involving confidential sources that Holder argued he was prevented by law from supplying. Issa narrowed the request in negotiations with Holder in recent weeks to focus on documents pertaining to decision-making on withdrawing the February 2011 letter. However, Holder refuses to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and he asked Obama to assert executive privilege over such documents before Wednesday\u2019s committee meeting. Boehner said Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege proved White House involvement and indicated a cover-up, which Carney later rejected. \u201cThe issue here is about after-the-fact internal documents that have to do with the executive branch\u2019s ability to operate appropriately and independently in response to congressional investigations and media inquiries,\u201d Carney said. He noted Holder had ended Fast and Furious when he learned about it, and ordered an inspector general to investigate it. The inspector general\u2019s report has yet to be completed. \u201cEvery piece of documentation that relates to the operation itself, if (the Republican) interest is in the operation, how it came about, its origination, how it was approved, why such a flawed tactic was employed \u2013 that has been provided to congressional investigators,\u201d Carney said. The ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, called Carney\u2019s statement \u201chogwash.\u201d \u201cThrough my investigation, I know there are reams of documents related to \u2018the operation itself\u2019 that the Justice Department refused to turn over to Congress,\u201d Grassley wrote in a statement. See letter to Issa from deputy attorney general (.PDF) Cummings said Republicans were being extreme with their contempt measure. \u201cYou have, once again, the far right of this party pushing and pushing,\u201d he added, leaving Obama with no option but to assert his executive privilege. \u201d \u2026 These were deliberative documents that all attorney generals have held close and not released. This attorney general released about 1,000 of those documents voluntarily, and Mr. Issa wanted more and more.\u201d Grassley said Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege raises questions, but \u201cwe know of no presidential involvement\u201d in Fast and Furious. What he wants, Grassley said, is to get to the bottom of who was behind the sting. \u201cI\u2019ve only been trying to find out who at the highest level of government \u2026 gave approval for this, so we can get them fired,\u201d he said. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Democrats noted that a similar program called Operation Wide Receiver was started during the Bush administration. They complained that Issa prevented the panel\u2019s investigation from fully examining any possible connection between Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious. Republicans repeatedly invoked the name of the slain border agent in demanding that Holder turn over all documents sought by the panel. \u201cAt the heart of the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious are disastrous consequences: a murdered Border Patrol Agent, his grieving family seeking answers, countless deaths in Mexico, and the souring effect on our relationship with Mexico,\u201d Issa said in a statement. \u201cCongress has not just a right but an obligation to do all that it can to uncover exactly what happened and ensure that it never occurs again.\u201d Holder rejects resignation call at heated Senate hearing Terry\u2019s family issued a statement Wednesday that called for all of the documents sought by the committee to be turned over. \u201cOur son lost his life protecting this nation, and it is very disappointing that we are now faced with an administration that seems more concerned with protecting themselves rather than revealing the truth behind Operation Fast and Furious,\u201d the statement said. Asked about the Terry family\u2019s statement Thursday, Carney recited the steps Holder took to end Fast and Furious and to cooperate with the investigation of the operation and said the inspector general has \u201cfull access to all documents\u201d sought by Republicans. \u201cThat is separate from an attempt by Republican members of Congress to try to score political points,\u201d he said. Grassley said any accusation of political motivation is \u201cbaseless,\u201d and he listed his attempts during the Bush administration to subpoena records or hold officials in contempt. If the House finds Holder in contempt, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted for criminal contempt, according to Alan Morrison, associate dean at George Washington University Law School. \u201cIt would look like terrible overreaching to go for criminal contempt,\u201d Morrison said. The charge carries a penalty of $1,000 and up to one year in prison. Instead, Morrison said, it is more likely the House would pursue civil prosecution in federal court. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that while Holder may be embarrassed, he won\u2019t ultimately be found in contempt. \u201cThis is going to be just another political dispute,\u201d Toobin told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cIf people remember at all, they\u2019ll remember 23 Republicans were for it, 17 Democrats were against it.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s House committee vote came more than six hours after notice that Obama had asserted executive privilege. On the border: Guns, drugs \u2013 and a betrayal of trust In a letter to Obama seeking that action, Holder said the documents involved related to the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cresponse to congressional oversight and related media inquiries,\u201d and that release of internal executive branch documents would have \u201csignificant, damaging consequences.\u201d Holder also said releasing the documents would \u201cinhibit the candor of executive branch deliberations in the future and significantly impair the ability of the executive branch to respond independently and effectively to congressional oversight.\u201d Holder said he offered to turn over some of the documents sought by Issa when they met Tuesday in a final effort to resolve the dispute before Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Issa, however, said Holder put unreasonable conditions on his offer. In a letter to Issa after Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Deputy Attorney General James Cole reiterated Holder\u2019s position that the documents would show Holder had nothing to hide about his role in Fast and Furious. Cole noted that the lone point of dispute was whether the February 4, 2011, letter was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation. \u201cThe answer to that question is an emphatic \u2018no,\u2019 and we have offered the committee the opportunity to satisfy itself that that is so,\u201d Cole wrote.

            "article_content": "The attorney general offers to hand over more \"Fast and Furious\" documents A House panel has threatened to hold him in contempt in a dispute over the records ATF agents lost track of more than 1,000 guns during the botched probe Facing a possible contempt vote by a House committee, Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday offered to release more records of a botched gun probe and proposed a quick face-to-face meeting with the committee\u2019s chairman. In a two-page letter to Rep. Darrell Issa, Holder promised to provide documents he has so far refused to turn over, arguing they were outside the scope of the committee\u2019s investigation of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d firearms probe. The offer follows a decision by Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to narrow the committee\u2019s request to exclude sensitive law enforcement information relating to the investigation. Holder called his offer \u201can extraordinary accommodation of the committee\u2019s interest\u201d and urged Issa to meet with him by Monday. Congressman says Justice Department can avoid contempt vote \u201cThe Department\u2019s willingness to provide these materials is a serious, good faith effort to bring this matter to an amicable resolution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, because as the Chairman only you have the authority to bind the Committee, I continue to believe that a meeting is required both to assure that there are no misunderstandings about this matter and to confirm that the elements of the proposal we are making will be deemed sufficient to render the process of contempt unnecessary.\u201d Holder at center of GOP fireworks Holder rejects Cornyn's call to resign In response, a spokeswoman for Issa\u2019s committee, Becca Glover Watkins, said Holder\u2019s letter \u201conly seems to indicate a willingness to offer a selective telling rather than full disclosure of key events that occurred after February 4, 2011. \u201cWe expect the Justice Department to quickly provide necessary details about how it is prepared to alter its opposition to producing subpoenaed documents,\u201d the spokeswoman added, without addressing Holder\u2019s proposal for a face-to-face meeting with Issa. Issa, a California Republican, has called a vote on a contempt of Congress resolution for next week, a move Holder\u2019s spokeswoman dismissed as something from \u201ca tired political playbook.\u201d The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched \u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. But it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. The documents Holder offered to share include details of how the Justice Department\u2019s knowledge of the gun-running probe \u201cevolved throughout 2011\u201d and how it came to retract a February 2011 letter that denied senior officials knew of improper tactics in the botched sting. \u201cThe Department\u2019s understanding of the facts underlying Fast and Furious became more developed, particularly as evidence came to light that was inconsistent with the initial denials provided to Department personnel,\u201d Holder wrote Thursday. \u201cOver time, Department leadership came to recognize that Fast and Furious was fundamentally flawed.\u201d Justice officials and Issa\u2019s committee have been battling for months over the materials, with Issa accusing the attorney general of stonewalling the investigation into \u201cFast and Furious.\u201d The Justice Department says it already has handed over more than 7,000 pages of records to House investigators, and says the remaining material Issa wants could jeopardize criminal prosecutions. Both Issa\u2019s Wednesday letter and Holder\u2019s response struck a more conciliatory tone. But the two sides remain far apart, and senior House GOP aides say the Obama administration is reluctant to detail an embarrassing program. And with five months left before the fall election, the issue has become a political battle that few expect will be ramped down before November. Holder fended off a call for his resignation Tuesday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, when Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused him of misleading Congress over the Fast and Furious program. Holder called Cornyn\u2019s complaint \u201calmost breathtaking in its inaccuracy\u201d and added, \u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of resigning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Terry Frieden and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Darrell Issa says Justice can avoid contempt vote on attorney general Issa wants proposal for release of documents on \"Fast and Furious\" operation Attorney General Eric Holder wants to avoid what he calls \"constitutional crisis\" A week before his committee is scheduled to hold a vote on a resolution holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa told the Department of Justice Wednesday it still has a chance to produce materials about the failed \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun-running operation and avoid a public vote. Holder held out an olive branch in his testimony before a Senate committee on Tuesday, volunteering to compromise on the House committee\u2019s request for documents the DOJ has so far declined to hand over because it does not want to release details on its internal discussions. Holder also offered to meet with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Issa, R-California, or others to find a way to avoid what he called a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d Issa responded to Holder\u2019s public plea in a letter Wednesday, writing, \u201cIf the Department of Justice submits a serious proposal for how it intends to alter its refusal to produce critical documents subpoenaed by the committee, I am ready and willing to meet to discuss your proposal.\u201d Last month, Boehner, other House GOP leaders, and Issa sent Holder a letter saying the committee had narrowed the scope of its request to documents showing internal discussions among senior DOJ officials and any materials generated after February 4, 2011, when the Justice Department initially gave Congress what Issa calls misleading accounts about the operation. Holder retracted the DOJ\u2019s response when whistle-blowers detailed information about the sting operation, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, that allowed weapons to be purchased illegally in order to track them to senior drug cartel members.  Agents lost track of hundreds of weapons in the process.  A federal border agent was killed in 2010 and weapons from the operation were found near his body. Issa\u2019s letter stressed that the committee modified its request to just these two areas and reiterated that addressing those areas was the way to avoid the vote next week. \u201cIf the department wishes to settle this dispute short of contempt, the committee has offered it a clear path to do so without the need to disclose sensitive documents created during Operations Fast and Furious,\u201d Issa wrote. A senior Justice Department official Wednesday said the latest letter from Issa was a move in the right direction, but it was unclear whether it was yet possible to break the deadlock over providing documents demanded by Issa\u2019s investigators, and to head off a contempt vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive step. We\u2019re encouraged Chairman Issa has narrowed the universe [of documents demanded]. We will respond,\u201d the Justice official said. The Justice official, requesting anonymity, did not indicate how quickly the Justice Department would provide a formal response to Issa, but it appears likely Holder or Deputy Attorney General James Cole will respond in a letter to Issa within the next day or two. Both sides have been battling for months over the materials.  While Issa says Holder is stonewalling, Justice Department officials emphasize that they have already given more than 7,000 pages in documents to House investigators and remaining materials Issa is demanding could jeopardize criminal prosecutions. But Issa\u2019s Wednesday letter, and the Justice Department\u2019s response, struck a more conciliatory tone.  Just two days ago Issa notified members he was scheduling a vote on a contempt resolution for next week because Justice continued to refuse to release the materials.  A spokeswoman for Holder dismissed that move as something from \u201ca tired political playbook.\u201d Despite the shift in language, the two sides continue to be very far apart on a resolution.  Senior House GOP aides continue to say they want documents and the committee is pursuing its designated oversight role, but is being blocked by administration officials reluctant to detail an embarrassing program. With five months left before the fall election, the high level back and forth with the administration and the GOP-led House has become a political battle, with few expecting either side to back down.

            "article_content": "NEW: GOP Sen. John Cornyn calls for Attorney General Eric Holder to resign or be replaced NEW: Holder tells Senate panel he won't resign A House committee says it will consider a contempt measure against Holder Republicans criticize Holder over 'Fast and Furious' program, probe of classified leaks Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday rejected a GOP call to resign, telling a heated Senate hearing that Republicans were trying to score political points instead of addressing significant issues. Under attack from the outset by Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder rejected accusations he was stonewalling congressional investigators on the botched \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gunrunning sting operation and failing to investigate recent leaks of classified information properly. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, leveled the harshest criticism, accusing Holder of misleading Congress over what he and other top Justice Department officials knew about the Fast and Furious program and refusing to appoint a special counsel to investigate leaked national security details in recent media reports. Holder rested his head on one hand as Cornyn recited a litany of allegations involving the attorney general\u2019s performance. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve come to an impasse,\u201d Cornyn said, adding that Holder \u201cviolated the public trust\u201d in his view. \u201cWith regret, you\u2019ve left me with no choice but to join those who call for you to resign your office.\u201d Holder responded by calling Cornyn\u2019s list of allegations \u201calmost breathtaking in its inaccuracy\u201d and said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of resigning.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that President Barack Obama maintains \u201cabsolute confidence\u201d in the attorney general, which Holder noted Tuesday. Regarding congressional demands for Fast and Furious documents, including a House committee that plans to take up a contempt measure against Holder next week, the attorney general said good-faith efforts to work with the House panel have failed to reach a deal. \u201cThe desire here is not for accommodation but for political point-making,\u201d Holder said, calling such behavior \u201cthe thing that turns people off about Washington.\u201d In what appeared to be a coordinated move, Republicans, led by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, introduced a resolution Tuesday supporting the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the classified leaks. McCain: Obama responsible for leaks At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Republican senators said Holder\u2019s decision to appoint two U.S. attorneys to investigate, rather than a special counsel, failed to address the seriousness of the violations and represented a Democratic double standard. Front Lines: Holder in contempt? The issue sparked angry exchanges between senators, with Chairman Pat Leahy of Vermont and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, both Democrats, taking issue with arguments by Cornyn and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, that Holder was acting improperly. In response to Democratic support for Holder on the classified leaks investigation, Graham shot back: \u201cIf the shoe was on the other foot, you and everyone else on the other side would be crying to high heaven to appoint a special prosecutor that all of us could buy into.\u201d Graham noted that as senators, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had called for the appointment of a special counsel in past situations that involved Republican transgressions, such as White House leaks in the Valerie Plame case that revealed the identity of the CIA operative. Senate breaks filibuster of Obama court pick The current leaks were more serious, Graham argued, and Holder should do now what Obama and Biden had called for then. However, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and is a member of the judiciary panel, repeated her past contention that a special counsel\u2019s investigation would take too long to deal with the immediate threat from classified leaks. She said she would oppose the McCain resolution, adding that Holder took the right step in naming two U.S. attorneys to investigate in addition to the FBI probe already under way. Holder told the committee that both he and FBI Director Robert Mueller had been interviewed \u201cbecause we were people who had knowledge of these matters, and we wanted to make sure that with regard to the investigation, that it began with us.\u201d Describing his experience as \u201ca serious interview that was done by some serious FBI agents,\u201d Holder said he believed about 100 interviews had been conducted so far. Holder earlier offered to negotiate with congressional leaders on turning over documents involving Fast and Furious to avoid what he said could become a constitutional crisis. He later modified his characterization of the problem to a possible constitutional conflict. \u201cI am prepared to make compromises with regard to the documents to be made available,\u201d Holder said. At the same time, Holder said congressional Republicans must be open to working out an agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve got to have a willing partner,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI\u2019ve extended my hand, and I\u2019m waiting to hear back.\u201d The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will consider the contempt measure against Holder on June 20, a panel statement said Monday. A vote by the panel could occur that day, and the measure would then require approval from the full chamber. Monday\u2019s announcement escalated a high-stakes, election-year face-off over what Republicans said is Holder\u2019s failure to respond to a subpoena for Justice Department documents on the botched operation. Could Congress go from bad to worse? The department has acknowledged the program, which allowed illegally purchased guns to \u201cwalk\u201d across the border into Mexico, was badly flawed. Such sting operations have now been prohibited. The department\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which lost track of more than 1,000 firearms after they crossed the border, found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010. Terry\u2019s family has been among critics of the Justice Department\u2019s handling of the case. On Tuesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, raised the matter in his opening statement and again in direct questioning of Holder, noting that questions remain almost a year after three whistle-blowers testified before the House Oversight and Goverment Reform Committee about gunrunning. \u201cHere we are, one year later, and the Terry family is still waiting for answers. They\u2019re still waiting for justice,\u201d Grassley said, noting assertions by House Republicans that sealed requests for wiretaps under the Fast and Furious program showed top Justice Department officials knew about the questionable operation long before so far acknowledged. Holder repeated what he told a House committee last week \u2013 that he read the affidavits and summaries and found no incriminating information. \u201cYou reach conclusions on the basis of hindsight,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI try to put myself in the place of people actually looking at the material at the time.\u201d Holder has testified at eight congressional hearings on Operation Fast and Furious, and he has consistently maintained that he knew nothing about the flawed tactics until early last year. The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said Monday that the panel wants documents that explain why Holder and the Justice Department decided months later to retract a February 4, 2011, letter to Congress that denied any knowledge by senior officials of improper tactics in the gunrunning sting. The Justice Department slammed the House committee\u2019s Monday announcement, calling it \u201cunfortunate and unwarranted.\u201d \u201cFrom the beginning, Chairman Issa has distorted the facts, ignored testimony and flung inaccurate accusations at the attorney general and others, and this latest move fits within that tired political playbook that has so many Americans disillusioned with Washington,\u201d said spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. Both Issa and the Justice Department statement said a resolution still could be reached to avoid the contempt measure. Last week, Holder assigned Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a Democratic appointee, and Rod J. Rosenstein, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland and a holdover GOP appointee, to lead the investigations into the alleged leaks. McCain and other Republicans are insisting on a special counsel, contending that investigators within the system would face a conflict of interest in pursuing top government officials. A recent report in The New York Times provided classified details of what it described as a U.S cyberattack targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuge program sparked the bipartisan outrage. Other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration\u2019s efforts to expand its drone program and Obama\u2019s involvement in \u201ckill lists\u201d against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. The public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula also angered intelligence and national security officials. Republicans noted that some articles cited sources who took part in White House meetings, which they said showed that leaks were coming from administration officials. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, repeatedly asked Holder how two U.S. attorneys could effectively investigate top national security issues involved in White House meetings cited. Holder insisted the attorneys he named were dogged prosecutors who would follow any lead, no matter where it took them. Obama has strongly rejected claims that his White House has deliberately leaked secrets to the media, saying the idea was \u201coffensive\u201d and would put Americans at risk. Graham, however, said Tuesday that the pattern of the administration was to be uncooperative on issues that might embarrass it \u2013 such as Fast and Furious and now the classified leaks. Holder responded the administration has prosecuted classified leaks more than any previous administration. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Deputy Attorney General James Cole offers to meet with Rep. Darrell Issa The president has \"absolute confidence\" in the attorney general, says spokesman The panel seeks documents on the botched \"Fast and Furious\" gun-running sting Attorney General Eric Holder maintains top officials were unaware of flawed tactics A House committee announced Monday it will consider a measure next week to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing to provide requested information on the department\u2019s handling of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun-smuggling sting operation. The House Oversight Committee will consider the contempt citation on June 20, said a statement by the panel. A vote by the panel could occur that day, and the measure would then require approval from the full chamber. Monday\u2019s announcement escalates a high-stakes, election-year face-off over what Republicans say is Holder\u2019s failure to respond to a subpoena for Justice documents on the botched operation. In the statement, committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said the panel wants documents that explain why Holder and the Justice Department decided months later to retract a February 4, 2011, letter to Congress that denied any knowledge by senior officials of improper tactics in the gun-running sting. Harsh 'Fast & Furious' hearing for Holder \u201cSpecifically, the Justice Department has refused to turn over critical documents on the grounds that they show internal department deliberations and were created after February 4, 2011 \u2013 the date Justice issued a false denial to Congress,\u201d Issa said in Monday\u2019s statement. \u201cContempt will focus on the failure to provide these post February 4th documents.\u201d Issa left the door open for a resolution before the contempt measure comes up, saying that if Holder \u201cdecides to produce these subpoenaed documents, I am confident we can reach agreement on other materials and render the process of contempt unnecessary.\u201d Holder has testified at seven congressional hearings on Operation Fast and Furious, which was run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He has consistently maintained that he knew nothing about the flawed tactics until early last year. The Justice Department slammed the House committee\u2019s announcement Monday, calling it \u201cunfortunate and unwarranted.\u201d \u201cFrom the beginning, Chairman Issa has distorted the facts, ignored testimony and flung inaccurate accusations at the Attorney General and others, and this latest move fits within that tired political playbook that has so many Americans disillusioned with Washington,\u201d said spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. The Justice Department is involved in discussions with committee staff regarding a \u201cmutually acceptable resolution to their requests for information,\u201d she added. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, similarly criticized the decision to move forward with possible contempt proceedings. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the Committee scheduled a contempt vote against the Attorney General when federal law prohibits him from turning over many of the subpoenaed documents, but I am guardedly optimistic that a path forward exists that will serve the legitimate interests of the Committee,\u201d Cummings said in a Monday statement. Various groups \u2013 among them The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, The National Action Network and the National Women\u2019s Law Center \u2013 have sent letters to either Issa or House Speaker John Boehner, urging the committee to reconsider the effort to cite Holder for contempt. White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama maintains \u201cabsolute confidence\u201d in the attorney general. At a hearing last week, Issa said applications for wiretaps connected to the program showed top Justice officials were aware early on that illegally purchased weapons in Arizona had ended up in the hands of Mexican cartels. Holder responded that the documents don\u2019t back Issa\u2019s claims of high-level knowledge of the operation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in those affidavits as I\u2019ve reviewed them that indicates that gun-walking was allowed,\u201d Holder said, adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything in there that would put on notice a person who was reviewing them \u2026 knowledge of the fact that these inappropriate tactics were being used.\u201d The Justice Department has acknowledged that the plan, which allowed illegally purchased guns to \u201cwalk\u201d across the border into Mexico, was badly flawed. Such sting operations have now been prohibited. The ATF, which lost track of more than a thousand firearms after they crossed the border, found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010. Terry\u2019s family has been among critics of the Holder Justice Department\u2019s handling of the case. Late Monday, Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent a letter to Issa, suggesting a meeting on the matter \u2013 an offer Cole said he\u2019s made previously. He called the committee\u2019s decision on the contempt hearing \u201cpremature.\u201d \u201cI am confident that the two of us, working in good faith, can bring this matter to a close,\u201d Cole wrote. Previously, a House Republican leadership source told CNN that Speaker Boehner gave his approval for Issa\u2019s committee to take up the contempt measure. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve given (the Department of Justice) every opportunity to handle this properly, but they\u2019ve stonewalled, and we have a constitutional responsibility to provide oversight,\u201d the source said on condition of not being identified. A congressional source, also speaking on condition of not being identified, noted that \u201cthere\u2019s a huge change between what they said in the February 4th letter and a full retraction of their statements in it. How did they come to that conclusion?\u201d CNN\u2019s Terry Frieden and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Attorney general discusses botched ATF operation in House hearing GOP congressman blasts Holder for not turning over documents Holder says documents don't back claims of high-level knowledge of operation Attorney General Eric Holder withstood a four-hour grilling Thursday dominated by Republican House members seeking to lay blame on Holder for a botched gun-smuggling sting operation. But in his seventh congressional hearing on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 Operation Fast and Furious, Holder left largely unscathed after standing by previous claims he knew nothing about the flawed tactics until early last year. The high-stakes, election-year face-off comes amid repeated GOP threats the House may find Holder in contempt for failing to respond to subpoenas for Justice documents on the operation. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, led the attack two days after he disclosed secret court documents he obtained from \u201cwhistle-blowers.\u201d  Issa said the applications for wiretaps he was given show top Justice officials were aware early on that illegally purchased weapons in Arizona had ended up in the hands of Mexican cartels. Issa, who is chairman of the Oversight Committee investigation of Fast and Furious, blasted Holder for not turning over additional documents he has demanded. \u201cNothing has come from your department, not a shred of paper,\u201d Issa said. He dismissed the more than 7,000 pages of Justice documents received earlier this year. Issa demanded to know if Holder and his aides had begun to pull together the documents the committee wants. Holder declined to answer. Holder then said the documents don\u2019t back Issa\u2019s claims of high-level knowledge of the operation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in those affadavits as I\u2019ve reviewed them that indicates that gun-walking was allowed,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything in there that would put on notice a person who was reviewing them \u2026 knowledge of the fact that these inappropriate tactics were being used,\u201d he added. The Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has acknowledged that the plan, which allowed illegally purchased guns to \u201cwalk\u201d across the border into Mexico, was badly flawed. Such sting operations have now been prohibited.  The ATF, which lost track of more than a thousand firearms after they crossed the border, found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010. Terry\u2019s family has been among critics of the Holder Justice Department\u2019s handling of the case. Holder appears before the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee next week, where Fast and Furious is likely to again be a major topic. On Thursday, members of three congressional caucuses said in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that threats to hold Holder in contempt of Congress are unwarranted. Leaders of the Black Caucus, Hispanic Caucus and Asian Pacific American Caucus wrote that the Justice Department has gone to \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to answer the committee\u2019s questions and said, \u201cWe are concerned that threats of contempt proceedings would distract the Nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer from vigorously enforcing the nation\u2019s laws.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Justice says it has cooperated extensively with \"Fast and Furious\" probe Issa's committee may vote on a contempt of Congress resolution The ATF operation allowed weapons to be purchased illegally The aim was to track the arms to senior drug cartel measures The top Republican on the House Oversight Committee is moving to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate in the panel\u2019s investigation of the controversial \u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d weapons sting. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, sent a 17-page memo and a draft contempt resolution to members of his committee Thursday, outlining what he argued was Justice Department\u2019s \u201crefusal\u201d to comply with the panel\u2019s probe to get information about the sting. The program, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, allowed weapons to be purchased illegally in order to track them to senior drug cartel members, but agents lost track of hundreds of weapons in the process. Issa indicated the committee may vote on the measure in an upcoming session, setting up a major confrontation between the Republican-led House and the Obama administration. The Justice Department firmly rejected the committee\u2019s publicly released document. In a letter to Issa, Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote that the department hopes to find a \u201cmutually acceptable resolution\u201d to demands for documents, but Issa\u2019s resolution \u201cappears to express a preference for confrontation over resolution.\u201d \u201cViewed fairly, the disagreements between the Committee and the Department over the scope of the document to be produced stem not from a lack of cooperation, but from our sincere and unwavering believe that disclosure of materials related to ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions could well jeopardize our core law enforcement mission, which must remain free from political pressure or even the appearance of political pressure,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not a novel concept. Cole told Issa the department has handed over 7,600 pages of material related to the botched probe, and Holder has testified about the issue seven times. But he said the committee needs to better define the types of documents it wants Justice to hand over. When word leaked last week that Issa was working on such a resolution, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, sent the chairman a letter accusing him of pressing the issue for political purposes. \u201cHolding someone in contempt of Congress is one of the most serious and formal actions our committee can take, and it should not be used as a political tool to generate press as part of an election-year witch hunt against the Obama administration,\u201d Cummings wrote. But in a Thursday interview on Fox News, Issa said, \u201cWe\u2019re running out of patience.\u201d He accused the Justice Department of a \u201ccoverup,\u201d but indicated he was still giving the department a chance to hand over the materials. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, then I have the support of leadership to do what we have to do,\u201d Issa said. If the Oversight Committee approves a contempt resolution, the measure could then go to the House floor for a full vote. But CNN has been told that Issa has no firm plans yet to hold a committee vote, hoping instead that the threat will pressure Holder to provide the documents the Republicans want. \u201cWhile there are very legitimate arguments to be made in favor of such an action, no final decision has been made about moving forward yet by GOP leaders,\u201d a senior House GOP leadership aide said when asked about the timing of a potential vote in the House on the matter. Last week, House Speaker John Boehner deflected questions on any vote, deferring to Issa\u2019s investigation. \u201cI continue to support their efforts and believe that this Justice Department must be held accountable,\u201d Boehner said. In an effort to paint Issa\u2019s efforts as politically motivated, a Democratic government source noted that Issa and other GOP lawmakers protested when the House voted to hold Bush administration officials in contempt in 2008. But an Issa aide said the two issues are completely different: The 2008 dispute involved officials who worked in the White House and claimed executive privilege, the aide said, while Issa is seeking information from an agency over which Congress has oversight. The committee memo accuses the Justice Department of \u201creckless conduct\u201d and notes that it has pressed the department for answers for more than a year about the operation and how it related to the death of Border Control Agent Brian Terry in 2010. Terry was shot near the Arizona border by an illegal immigrant. Two AK-47s recovered at the scene were traced back to a database of weapons bought by a straw purchaser and then smuggled into Mexico in an operation that resulted in the loss of hundreds of weapons. After Terry\u2019s death, the Justice Department initially denied allegations in a letter to Congress that it was illegally allowing the flow of weapons to members of Mexican drug rings. But it acknowledged the program about a year later, calling it \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d Holder has since vowed that guns will not be allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d from gun shops near the border with Mexico. In February, Holder told Congress the Justice Department was still doing its internal inquiry, but stated that officials could be fired for improper conduct. \u201cI can assure you those people will be removed from federal service,\u201d he vowed. Issa\u2019s memo notes that while the Justice Department has provided some materials to Capitol Hill, most of the information about \u201cFast and Furious\u201d came though whistle-blowers and media reports. The Oversight Committee approved a subpoena sent to Holder in October 2011 with 22 categories of documents it wanted to see, but the committee says it has only received materials relating to 12 of those categories. \u201cFor over a year, the department has issued false denials, given answers intended to misdirect investigators, sought to intimidate witnesses, unlawfully withheld subpoenaed documents, and waited to be confronted with indisputable evidence before acknowledging uncomfortable facts,\u201d the memo states. Cole said Justice has provided more documents to its Inspector General\u2019s office, which is conducting its own investigation of \u201cFast and Furious.\u201d And cited internal legal opinions dating back to the Reagan administration to argue against disclosing some documents to Congress. Specifically, the committee is pressing for documents that shed light on why the Justice Department first denied and then acknowledged the program. It also wants more information on which senior Justice Department officials knew about the operation and who approved it, as well as why the various law enforcement agencies allegedly failed to communicate with each other about the operation. Issa\u2019s committee has been holding a joint investigation with the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Grassley said he supported Issa\u2019s move to press for a contempt resolution, and urged the Justice Department to \u201ccome clean.\u201d \u201cThe attorney general and the Justice Department are thumbing their nose at the constitutional authority provided to the legislative branch to conduct oversight,\u201d Grassley said in a written statement. The controversy over the operation has prompted some GOP members on the Hill to call for Holder\u2019s resignation, and more than 100 House Republicans signed onto a resolution of \u201cno confidence\u201d against the attorney general \u2013 a largely symbolic gesture that is less serious than a contempt resolution.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Rick Santorum pledges full support for Republicans, but doesn't endorse Mitt Romney Romney blames President Obama for a tepid economic recovery Obama announces a new economic program en route to the Americas summit Tax returns show the president paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.5% in 2011 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a conservative audience what it wanted to hear Friday, accusing President Barack Obama of leading the country away from the founding fathers\u2019 vision and \u201ctoward limited freedom and limited opportunity.\u201d In an address to the National Rifle Association\u2019s convention billed by Romney\u2019s advisers as a launch of his general election campaign, Romney said Obama\u2019s attack on freedom is to blame for the country\u2019s slow economic recovery from recession. \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s assault on our economic freedom is the principal reason why the recovery has been so tepid \u2013 why it couldn\u2019t meet their projections, let alone our expectations,\u201d Romney said. While Romney remains short of the delegates needed to claim the Republican presidential nomination, his closest pursuer \u2013 conservative challenger Rick Santorum \u2013 dropped out of the race this week and the two other contenders \u2013 former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul \u2013  have no realistic chance of winning. A senior Romney adviser who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity characterized the Romney address as \u201cthe beginning of crystallizing for voters the choice that they are going to have in the fall between a big-government liberal, represented by Barack Obama, and somebody who believes in the freedoms which are an essential part of our Constitution, which are consistent with our founders, and that would be Mitt Romney.\u201d Gingrich and Santorum followed Romney in addressing the NRA gathering, which served as a conservative conclave with other top Republicans \u2013 including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa \u2013 also scheduled to speak. Santorum, who had rejected Romney\u2019s conservative credentials on the campaign trail, pledged his full commitment to helping conservative candidates win in November but didn\u2019t endorse Romney. \u201cWe have to be all in and I pledge to you that even though I am no longer in this race that I will be all in between now and November,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cI will do everything we can to make sure that we elect Republicans, conservatives up and down the ticket, and with your help we will make that happen.\u201d Not surprisingly, both Santorum and Romney also offered NRA members strong support for the rights of gun owners, now under extra focus as the Trayvon Martin shooting resonates through the country. Gingrich went even further in his remarks, calling for a U.N. treaty that extends the right to bear arms to every person on Earth. Meanwhile, Obama was en route Friday to Cartagena, Colombia, for the sixth annual Summit of the Americas with leaders from the Western Hemisphere to discuss the economy, trade, energy and regional security. Before leaving the United States, Obama stopped in the battleground state of Florida to talk trade and the economy, announcing a new program that he said would help businesses get financing and counseling on how to access new markets south of the border. \u201cThis initiative is going to help our small business: Latino-owned businesses. Women-owned businesses. African-American-owned businesses,\u201d Obama said, hitting on a few key political constituencies. Earlier Friday, the White House released Obama\u2019s tax returns, which showed that the first family\u2019s income dropped by almost $1 million in 2011 as sales from his best-selling books slowed. The Obama family reported an adjusted gross income of $789,674 for 2011, down from $1,728,096 in the previous year. The family income topped $5.5 million in 2009. Obama earns a salary of $400,000 for his day job. His total earnings are much higher because his books \u2013 \u201cDreams from My Father,\u201d and \u201cThe Audacity of Hope\u201d \u2013 continue to attract buyers. The Obamas reported paying $162,074 in federal taxes. They donated $172,130, or 22% of their income, to 39 different charities. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, noted in a statement that Obama\u2019s 2011 effective federal income tax rate is 20.5% and that the president\u2019s own policies would result in higher taxes for the Obama family. In its own statement Friday, the Obama campaign challenged Romney to release his returns for past years, saying Romney \u201chas yet to provide tax returns from the period in which he made hundreds of millions as a corporate buyout specialist, or as governor of Massachusetts, the experience he says qualifies him to be president.\u201d \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s defiance of decades of precedent set by presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle, including his own father, begs the question \u2013 what does he have to hide?\u201d the campaign statement said, citing disclosure earlier this year that Romney had a Swiss bank account and established a corporation in Bermuda. Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said the candidate filed an extension for his 2011 return on Friday. \u201cSometime in the next six months, and prior to the election, Gov. Romney will file and release the 2011 return when there is sufficient information to provide an accurate return,\u201d Saul\u2019s statement said, adding that Romney had filed similar extensions in previous years. Her statement made no mention of the Democratic call for Romney to file returns from previous years. Romney\u2019s tax returns previously arose as an issue in January, when Democrats, along with fellow Republican presidential candidates, pressured Romney\u2019s campaign to release the documents. On January 24, Romney\u2019s team released his 2010 tax return, as well as an estimate for 2011. Opponents quickly derided the disclosure as paltry, noting that other candidates, including Romney\u2019s father during his run for the GOP nomination in 1968, released a decade\u2019s worth of tax returns. The forms released then showed Romney earned $42.7 million over the past two years and paid $6.2 million in taxes. Over the two years, Romney\u2019s effective tax rate \u2013 the percentage of his income that he owed in federal income taxes \u2013 was 14.5%. Democrats, eager to align themselves with middle-class voters, quickly assailed Romney for paying a low tax rate while earning millions of dollars. Obama is pushing for Congress to approve the so-called Buffett Rule, which would ensure that Americans making more than $1 million a year pay at least 30% in taxes. On Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Romney at a campaign stop in New Hampshire for promoting a \u201cRomney Rule\u201d on taxes that would benefit only millionaires like him \u2013 a harsh comparison with the \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d that Democrats are promoting. \u201cThe Buffett Rule says that multimillionaires should pay at least the same percentage of their income in taxes as middle-class families do,\u201d Biden said Thursday. \u201cThe Romney Rule says the very wealthy should keep the tax cuts and loopholes they have, and get an additional, new tax cut every year that is worth more than what the average middle-class family makes in an entire year.\u201d In response, Saul called the Democratic attacks a diversionary tactic. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise with the worst job creation record in modern history that President Obama would try to distract Americans from the real issues with a series of sideshows,\u201d she said. Campaign rhetoric kicked into high gear this week once Santorum suspended his bid for the GOP nomination. On Thursday, a Democratic strategist apologized for a comment questioning Ann Romney\u2019s qualifications to advise her husband on women\u2019s economic issues, while the Romney campaign sought to exploit the controversy to help fix a gender gap problem in the race against Obama. Hilary Rosen issued a statement after fellow Democrats, including a Twitter post on Michelle Obama\u2019s page, criticized her remarks the night before on CNN. \u201cI apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended,\u201d said the statement by Rosen, who is a CNN contributor. \u201cLet\u2019s declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance.\u201d In a later interview on CNN, Rosen said that she \u201cshould not have chosen words that seemed to attack Ann Romney\u2019s choice in life\u201d and that she hoped Ann Romney \u201cunderstands I didn\u2019t mean it personally,\u201d adding \u201cI was trying to talk about economic issues.\u201d She also said the controversy over her remarks portended \u201can ugly campaign season.\u201d The political firestorm ignited quickly after Rosen said Wednesday night on CNN\u2019s \u201cAC360\u02da\u201d that Mitt Romney shouldn\u2019t be relying on his wife for guidance on economic issues affecting women. \u201cWhat you have is Mitt Romney running around the country, saying, \u2018Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing,\u2019 \u201d Rosen said. \u201cGuess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.\u201d Republicans slammed Rosen\u2019s comments as disparaging to stay-at-home mothers, and top Democrats, including Obama and his chief campaign adviser, also chimed in. On Thursday, Twitter posts attributed to Michelle Obama and Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz took exception with Rosen\u2019s remarks. \u201cEvery mother works hard, and every woman deserves to be respected,\u201d the first lady tweeted. Ann Romney told Fox News earlier Thursday that raising five boys was hard work, and she hears from women all the time about economic difficulties they face. \u201cLook, I know what it is like to struggle,\u201d said Romney, a cancer survivor who has multiple sclerosis. \u201cIf maybe I haven\u2019t struggled as much financially as some people have, I can tell you and promise you that I have had struggles in my life. And I would love to have people understand that Mitt and I have compassion for people that are struggling, and that\u2019s why we are running.  We care about those people that are struggling, and we recognize that this economic recovery has been very weak.\u201d With polls repeatedly showing female voters favoring Obama over the former Massachusetts governor, Romney launched a harsh attack Wednesday on how the administration\u2019s economic policies hurt women. Rosen\u2019s comments provided another opening on the issue for the Romney campaign. Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said Rosen was a frequent White House visitor who was saying what the Obama campaign intended. \u201cClearly they are using surrogate women, including Hilary Rosen, who is a paid spokesperson, to deliver messages about Republicans that the president does not want to deliver himself for fear of the backlash,\u201d she said. Rosen said she is not an adviser to the White House or the Democratic National Committee. At the White House, Carney said Thursday he was unaware of how many times Rosen had visited. In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, Carney repeatedly emphasized Obama\u2019s policies on women, such as making the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act the first piece of legislation he signed into law. Romney\u2019s campaign still struggles to generate enthusiasm among the GOP conservative base, which questions his more moderate stances as Massachusetts governor. In addition, a Washington Post/ABC News poll this week affirmed findings of other recent polls that Romney trails Obama among female voters. Another poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University showed Obama leading Romney in New Jersey, even under the hypothetical scenario that popular Republican Gov. Chris Christie was on the GOP ticket as Romney\u2019s running mate. New Jersey is considered a solidly Democratic state in presidential general elections. The Quinnipiac poll also showed a Romney-Christie ticket trailing against Obama and Biden among female voters. The Republican presidential campaign has included a conservative shift to appeal to tea party voters in the primary and caucus season. However, some socially conservative polices opposing abortion and health care coverage for contraception appear to be raising concerns among female voters. Democrats have seized on that dynamic by emphasizing Republican stances that they say harm equal treatment and opportunity for women. In response, the Romney campaign is targeting Obama\u2019s economic policies as being bad for women. Romney got a boost Thursday when two prominent anti-abortion groups \u2013 the Susan B. Anthony List and National Right to Life \u2013 endorsed his nomination, a sign that conservatives will coalesce around his candidacy despite concerns about his more moderate history as Massachusetts governor. CNN\u2019s latest estimate of the GOP delegate tally shows Romney with 659, Santorum with 275, Gingrich with 140 and Paul with 71. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination. By suspending his campaign, Santorum can continue raising money and likely keep control of some or all of his delegates. Both Gingrich and Paul say they intend to stay in the race to the GOP convention in August. The next primaries are April 24 in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware, with 231  delegates at stake. The goal now for Gingrich and Paul is to prevent Romney from reaching the 1,144-delegate threshold before the convention.

            "article_content": "President Obama is making the longest U.S. presidential visit to Colombia Obama announces a program to help U.S. businesses access southern markets The sixth Summit of the Americas won't include Cuba, however The hemisphere's drug war is expected to be addressed President Barack Obama\u2019s trip to Cartagena, Colombia, will be historic from the moment Air Force One touches down Friday. His weekend visit will mark the longest time a U.S. president will have spent in that country, where security concerns had limited previous presidential trips. During his visit for the sixth Summit of the Americas, the president plans to focus on the economy, trade, energy and regional security. He\u2019s also expected to highlight some of the democratic and social reforms in the region. In a speech Friday in Tampa, Florida, en route to Cartagena, Obama announced a new program that the White House is calling the Small Business Network of the Americas, which he said would help businesses get financing and counseling on how to access new markets south of the U.S. border. \u201cThis initiative is going to help our small business. Latino-owned businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen-owned businesses. African-American-owned businesses.\u201d But the agenda may be driven by other concerns that have been debated by the Latin American leaders long before they arrived for the summit. Cuba, which is not a member of the Organization of American States, is not invited to join the 34 other leaders. \u201cThis is a point of contention,\u201d said Ted Piccone, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who specializes in U.S.-Latin American relations. \u201cThere is a lot of disagreement about the U.S. policy toward Cuba. \u2026 Cuba doesn\u2019t have a democratically elected government and therefore doesn\u2019t meet the criteria,\u201d he said. But that didn\u2019t stop Ecuador\u2019s leftist President Rafael Correa from stoking the fire to get Cuban leader Raul Castro a seat at the table. Correa threatened to put together a boycott with other leaders in the Bolivian Alliance (Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua), which led to intense diplomacy behind the scenes. Inviting Castro would have certainly caused problems for Obama, especially in an election year. During the previous summit three years ago in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Obama had an uncomfortable encounter with Hugo Chavez, when the Venezuelan leader handed him a book critical of the United States and Europe. Colombian officials were clearly aware of the potential fallout in this case, so the country\u2019s foreign minister was dispatched to Cuba. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos himself then flew to Cuba to meet with Castro. Those meetings effectively ended the dispute, but Ecuador\u2019s Correa was angry. He fired off a letter to Santos criticizing the veto of Cuba\u2019s participation as \u201cintolerable.\u201d Then he boycotted the summit, even though the other leaders who had supported his appeal confirmed they would attend. Piccone, of the Brookings Institution, said some leaders in the region are frustrated with what they view as a leftover Cold War attitude in the United States toward Cuba, and they are pushing for changes. \u201cMy concern is that if it is fixed at the cost of abandoning the democratic rules of the group, that would too high a price to pay,\u201d Piccone said. The high price being paid in the drug war across Latin America is also fueling a debate. At a recent meeting at the White House with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Obama was blunt about the ongoing threat in a region where some of the leaders believe the drug war is failing. \u201cBeyond our borders, these cartels and traffickers pose an extraordinary threat to our Central American neighbors,\u201d Obama said. One possible solution that some of those neighbors discussed is decriminalizing drugs. But on a recent trip to Mexico, a country that has been ravaged by drug-related violence, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden rejected that idea. \u201cThere is no possibility that the Obama-Biden administration will change its policy on legalization,\u201d he said. While this debate won\u2019t dominate the discussions at the summit, it could make headlines. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s likely the issue will come up, and we welcome the discussion. However, our policy is different,\u201d he said. The unscripted moments are likely to be the most interesting at the summit as there is no significant agreement expected on any of the major issues.

            "article_content": "NEW: There are many more gun stores than Walmarts, the Mexican president complains President Obama meets with the leaders of Mexico and Canada Canada and Mexico want to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership Monday's meeting precedes an upcoming Summit of the Americas in Colombia President Barack Obama and the visiting leaders of Mexico and Canada on Monday pledged joint efforts to combat drug cartels in Mexico and expand international trade, including support for Canada and Mexico joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Citing the increasingly global nature of issues such as trade and security, the three leaders told reporters that what happens within the borders of their neighboring countries affects everyone in North America. Obama repeated his previous support to reduce the demand for drugs in North America and slow the flow of guns and money across the border into Mexico. Mexican President Felipe Calderon expressed appreciation for such efforts but also sounded frustrated with the continuing availability of weapons including assault rifles. In particular, he said the expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban in 2004 \u201ccoincided almost exactly with the beginning of the harshest period of violence we\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 during my government.\u201d \u201cWe have seized over 140,000 weapons in four years and I think that the vast majority have been assault weapons \u2026 and many, the vast majority of these weapons were sold in gun shops in the United States along the border of the U.S. and Mexico,\u201d Calderon said. \u201cThere are approximately 8,000 weapons shops. If we do our accounts, that means that there\u2019s approximately nine weapon stores for each Walmart that exists in the United States and Mexico.\u201d Monday\u2019s North American Leaders\u2019 Summit was the first such meeting in more than two years and served as a prelude to the Summit of the Americas set for mid-April in Cartagena, Colombia. The three leaders met in the morning and had a working lunch before holding a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden. The talks came less than a week after the three nations\u2019 defense ministers met in Canada, pledging to do more to confront and combat drug cartels on the continent. Military officials said they would dedicate more time to patrolling waters and inspecting shipping containers that cross borders. They also said they were working to share more intelligence in a timely manner. Obama said Monday that  the United States and Canada must be concerned about the powerful Mexican drug cartels because they influenced security throughout the region, including Central America. \u201cWhen you have innocent families and women and children who are being gunned down on the streets, that should be everybody\u2019s problem, not just our problem, not just their problem,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere is a sense of neighborly regard and concern that has to be part of our calculus and our foreign policy.\u201d Allowing the drug cartels to expand their power and influence would pose an even greater threat to the region and \u201ccould have a deteriorating effect overall on the nature of our relationship,\u201d Obama said. In February, Calderon called called on U.S. officials to stop gun trafficking across the border, saying the move would be the best thing Americans could do to stop brutal drug violence. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have mechanisms to forbid the sale of weapons \u2026 then we are never going to be able to stop with the violence in Mexico or stop a future turning of those guns upon the U.S.,\u201d Calderon said Monday. \u201cThinking that what happens in Mexico doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the security of the citizens of this country or of any other citizen of North America is a mistake,\u201d he added later. \u201cWe have to understand that we are all tied to one another.\u201d The three leaders also expressed support for streamlining regulations and taking other steps to increase trade among themselves and with the rest of the world. Obama said the United States welcomed the desire by Canada and Mexico to become members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a planned free trade agreement  comprising the United States, Australia, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei. He noted that any trade negotiation involved participants having to make adjustments and concessions, but called such give-and-take part of the normal process and said he didn\u2019t see any extraordinary issues emerging. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a \u201clogical extension\u201d of what he called Canada\u2019s ambitious trade agenda, while Calderon added Mexico could add a lot to the planned partnership. In a joint statement after the talks, the three leaders also announced plans for greater cooperation on climate change issues as well as the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza, which they said would \u201cstrengthen our response to future animal and pandemic influenza events in North America.\u201d There was no mention in their statement or remarks to reporters of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada\u2019s tar sands production to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Obama administration blocked the project this year, blaming political wrangling, and Harper has made clear that Canada would seek other export destinations for the tar sands oil if no progress occurs. Last year, officials postponed a previously scheduled meeting of the three leaders after Mexico\u2019s interior minister, Francisco Blake Mora, died in a helicopter crash. Calderon hosted the last North American Leaders\u2019 Summit in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2009. The North American leaders, nicknamed by some as the \u201cthree amigos,\u201d face differing political futures. Calderon will step down later this year because of term limits in Mexico, while Harper led his Conservative Party to victory last May and Obama faces a re-election challenge in November.

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama touts reduced dependency on foreign oil \"We are drilling more,\" Obama says in response to critics The president is speaking at sites for solar, domestic oil and other energy sources Republican presidential candidates say his actions on energy fall short President Barack Obama took on critics of his energy policies Thursday, saying in carefully coordinated speeches that they weren\u2019t paying attention to increased oil production at home and were misleading the public about the cause of rising gas prices. \u201cAnyone who says that we\u2019re somehow suppressing domestic oil production isn\u2019t paying attention,\u201d Obama said in Cushing, Oklahoma, on the second day of a four-state tour to tout his policies. \u201cAnd anyone who says that just drilling more will bring gas prices down just isn\u2019t playing it straight,\u201d the president continued. \u201d We are drilling more.  We are producing more.  But the fact is, producing more oil at home isn\u2019t enough to bring gas prices down overnight.\u201d In Cushing and a later speech at The Ohio State University, Obama repeated his call for a diversified policy that increases production of traditional energy sources such as oil and natural gas while increasing investment in alternative sources such as solar, wind and hydrogen power to compete in growing global clean energy markets. In particular, he rejected Republican claims that U.S. oil reserves alone offer a solution to higher gas prices and long-term supplies. \u201cEven if we drilled every little bit of this great country of ours, we\u2019d still have to buy enough from the rest of the world to meet our needs,\u201d Obama said in Cushing. He added that \u201cthe price of oil is set by the global market, and that means every time tensions rise in the Middle East, so will gas prices at home.\u201d In particular, Obama said, rising tension involving Iran was causing the current spike in global oil prices. At Ohio State, Obama emphasized to a cheering student crowd that since he took office in 2009, \u201cAmerica\u2019s dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year.\u201d \u201cEven as the economy was growing, we\u2019ve made progress in reducing the amount of oil we have to import because we\u2019re being smarter, we\u2019re doing things better,\u201d the president said. Romney turns up heat on Obama energy policies The whirlwind trip over two days followed weeks of criticism of his approach to gas price increases by Republicans on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail. \u201cHe has an energy policy that is very simple,\u201d Rick Santorum said of the president during a campaign stop Monday in Illinois. \u201cYou can sum it up in two letters, N-O. He is against everything that will create economic incentives to drill.\u201d Newt Gingrich has made reducing prices at the pump a central promise of his campaign, telling voters at a recent event in Birmingham, Alabama, that \u201can American president who believed in energy and an American president who believed in science and technology would drive the price of gasoline below $2.\u201d Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl sounded a similar refrain after a Republican caucus meeting in early March, agreeing with the president\u2019s all-of-the-above approach, but adding, \u201cWe need it in action, not just words.\u201d A focus of Republican attacks has been the delay in administration approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada\u2019s tar sands production in northern Alberta to the Gulf Coast. Keystone pipeline: Separating rhetoric from reality Last year, the administration put off a decision until 2013 after protests by environmentalists concerned about high carbon emissions from tar sands oil production and objections by Nebraska officials to a route near a vital aquifer. Republicans in Congress, accusing Obama of avoiding the issue until after the November election, tried to speed the process by tacking a measure requiring an immediate decision to the temporary payroll tax cut bill last December. The Obama administration then rejected the pipeline permit in January, saying an alternate route from Nebraska had yet to be decided. Since then, Republicans have persisted in attacking Obama for rejecting the permit. The president announced Thursday in Cushing that he was using his executive authority to order federal agencies to expedite the approval process for large-scale infrastructure projects like oil pipelines. More specifically, he ordered the portion of the Keystone XL pipeline running from Cushing to the Gulf to be placed at the top of the list. \u201cWe\u2019re making this new pipeline from Cushing to the Gulf a priority,\u201d Obama said to cheers, later adding that \u201cas long as I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to keep encouraging oil development and infrastructure and we\u2019re going to do it in a way that protects the health and safety of the American people. We don\u2019t have to choose between one or the other. We can do both.\u201d Many private companies \u2013 including TransCanada, the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL project \u2013 are working to build pipelines that relieve the bottleneck of oil in Cushing, a major hub for crude oil storage and trade. While federal agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior have some involvement in the approval process for the domestic portion of the pipeline, the federal government has relatively little control when compared to the absolute say it holds over the portion that crosses the international border with Canada. The ultimate decision-making authority for the pipeline\u2019s domestic route lies mainly with the states it crosses, prompting Republicans to question whether the president can actually claim any credit for speeding the project along. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Thursday that Obama was claiming credit he didn\u2019t deserve on the southern leg of the Keystone pipeline while continuing to prevent construction on the northern leg from Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s already gotten its approvals and this idea that the president is going to expedite this will have no impact on the construction of this pipeline,\u201d Boehner said of the Cushing-Gulf Coast portion. \u201cThe president has continued to block development of oil and gas reserves, big reserves, on federal lands.  And he can go out and make all the noise that he wants, but the facts are there.\u201d Poll: Majority say build Keystone pipeline On Wednesday, Obama kicked off his energy tour with stops in Boulder City, Nevada, and Maljamar, New Mexico, to focus on work on alternative energy sources. The visit to Boulder City was designed to tout the success of solar technology at the largest photovoltaic solar facility in the nation. Photovoltaic solar panels create energy directly from sunlight without the need for any water or moving parts. Obama acknowledged the high prices at the pump, but used the problem as a reason to abandon federal \u201csubsidies\u201d to oil and gas companies. \u201cWe want to encourage production of oil and gas, and make sure that wherever we\u2019ve got American resources, we are tapping into them,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t need an additional incentive when gas is $3.75 a gallon, when oil is $120 a barrel, $125 a barrel. They don\u2019t need additional incentives. They\u2019re doing fine.\u201d What the president calls subsidies, the petroleum industry calls the same tax breaks afforded those in many other industries. The push to end what Obama deems to be preferential treatment to a petroleum industry that\u2019s never been more profitable was central to his two-day tour, but the president also used the trip to push back against those who call federal aid to the renewable energy industry a waste of money. \u201cSome of these folks want to dismiss the promise of solar power and wind power and fuel-efficient cars,\u201d Obama said in Boulder City. \u201cIn fact, they make jokes about it. One member of Congress who shall remain unnamed called these jobs \u2018phony\u2019 \u2013 called them phony jobs. I mean, think about that mindset, that attitude that says because something is new, it must not be real. If these guys were around when Columbus set sail, they\u2019d be charter members of the Flat Earth Society.\u201d With nearly a million solar panels spread across 450 acres, Copper Mountain 1 in Boulder City provides power for roughly 17,000 homes, but employs just 10 full-time employees. The solar plant\u2019s owner, Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, is in the process of building a second facility nearby that\u2019s set to more than triple the output of Copper Mountain 1. Construction of the second facility \u2013 Copper Mountain 2 \u2013 has created 175 temporary jobs but, according to Sempra\u2019s own projections, the final solar plant will result in just five full-time positions.

            "article_content": "The Senate Republican leader rejects ending oil subsidies President Obama ridicules Republicans for drill-only energy strategy Republicans seek to make high gas prices an election focus The White House and Republicans have signaled possible compromise A day after Republicans signaled possible compromise with the White House on energy issues, President Barack Obama called Thursday for Congress to vote in the coming weeks on ending billions of dollars in subsidies for the oil industry. \u201cEliminate this oil industry giveaway right away. I want them to vote on this in the next few weeks,\u201d Obama told students at Nashua Community College in New Hampshire. \u201cLet\u2019s put every single member of Congress on record: You can stand with oil companies, or you can stand with the American people. You can keep subsidizing a fossil fuel that\u2019s been getting taxpayer dollars for a century, or you can place your bets on a clean energy future.\u201d Framing the issue as a major challenge for the students\u2019 generation, Obama said developing a broad-based energy policy incorporating all sources \u2013 oil, gas, nuclear, solar, wind and alternatives such as algae \u2013 would take years but was essential for the nation\u2019s future economic well-being. His speech came as gas prices continued to soar around the nation, prompting criticism from Republicans that Obama\u2019s policies failed to fully exploit U.S. resources that would help bring down energy costs. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky rejected Obama\u2019s call to end the oil subsidies. Obama: We can't just drill \u201cIf someone in the administration can show me that raising taxes on American energy production will lower gas prices and create jobs, then I will gladly discuss it,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cBut since nobody can, and the president doesn\u2019t, this is merely an attempt to deflect from his failed policies.\u201d On the campaign trail Thursday, GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney said Obama sought to take credit for increased U.S. production but should in fact be \u201changing his head.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get credit for the increase; he instead has tried to slow the growth of oil and gas production in this country, and coal production in this country,\u201d Romney told an enthusiastic audience in Fargo, North Dakota. Romney and other Republicans say it was policies under the Bush administration that led to today\u2019s increased production, and they criticize Obama for stalling a pipeline from Canada as well as other steps that they say hold back more U.S. output. Obama devoted some of his speech Thursday to stating what he said were the facts \u2013 U.S. production is at its highest level in eight years, with more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined. \u201cNo matter what you hear from some folks in an election year, a key part of this strategy over the last three years has been to increase safe, responsible oil production here at home,\u201d he said. Obama also took aim at Republican calls for what he described as unlimited drilling and development, saying \u201canyone who tells you we can drill our way out of this problem doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about \u2013 or they\u2019re not telling you the truth.\u201d Meanwhile, Obama\u2019s re-election team defended its \u201call-of-the-above energy strategy\u201d while criticizing Romney for saying \u201canything to get elected.\u201d \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s backward-looking energy policy does not meet America\u2019s complex energy needs today,\u201d campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt said in a statement. \u201cHis tax plan keeps subsidies for big oil and gas companies making billions in profits. And he has made clear he is not concerned about gas prices.\u201d In his remarks, Obama repeated popular lines from previous energy speeches, noting that increased fuel efficiency standards will save the average family $8,000 a year by the middle of next decade and promising to continue investing in clean energy sources. The rising gas price threatens to slow signs of consistent economic recovery in recent months, and Republican critics have focused on the issue as the November presidential election campaign heats up. On Wednesday, Republican leaders and the White House sent signals of possible detente on jobs and energy legislation, but they offered few specifics and congressional Democrats questioned whether any progress would ensue. Obama had a rare luncheon meeting with leaders of both parties in Congress, including McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio \u2013 two of his biggest adversaries in the political wrangling that has brought public scorn of congressional inaction. Boehner later told reporters that \u201cwe discussed a number of areas where I believe there\u2019s common ground between the two political parties, particularly on jobs and on energy.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney called the lunch meeting \u201ccordial and constructive,\u201d and he cited proposals to help small businesses as an area of possible agreement. Democratic aides declined to give any details or readout on the White House lunch that included Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. When Boehner was asked about the assessment by another Congress member that people were feeling better about the economy, he acknowledged that the economy was \u201ca little better,\u201d but said rising energy prices were a threat. One issue discussed Wednesday was the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands in northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Republicans accuse Obama of putting off a decision on the pipeline until after the November election for political reasons, because his environmentalist supporters oppose the dirtier form of oil production and the risks of a long pipeline through ecologically sensitive regions.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama meets congressional leaders for lunch Republican leaders say agreement is possible on jobs and energy legislation The White House cites some common ground on those issues Congressional Democrats question whether progress will ensue Republican leaders and the White House sent signals Wednesday of possible detente on jobs and energy legislation, but they offered few specifics and congressional Democrats questioned whether any progress would ensue. President Barack Obama had a rare luncheon meeting with leaders of both parties in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. They are two of his biggest adversaries in the political wrangling that has brought public scorn of congressional inaction. \u201cWe discussed a number of areas where I believe there\u2019s common ground between the two political parties, particularly on jobs and on energy, and I\u2019d like to think that some of the bipartisan bills that we have moved through the House will \u2026 be taken up soon by Democrats over in the Senate,\u201d Boehner later told reporters at a news conference with McConnell. In particular, Boehner cited what he called Obama\u2019s support for a House Republican proposal called the JOBS act, short for \u201cJump-starting Our Business Startups,\u201d that is comprised of six measures aimed at removing barriers to small business investment. \u201cThe president was very optimistic about moving that bill through the House,\u201d Boehner said of the measure expected to come up for a vote next week. \u201cFrankly, it was a very good luncheon, and I\u2019m encouraged by the attitude and the tone that we had during the meeting.\u201d Obama: American auto industry is back Gas prices hinder Florida tourism White House spokesman Jay Carney called the lunch meeting \u201ccordial and constructive,\u201d and he cited proposals to help small businesses as an area of possible agreement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very explicit about the opportunity to move forward on some aspects of\u201d the JOBS proposal, Carney said. Most of the JOBS act measures have already passed the House with bipartisan support. However, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland dismissed the introduction of the proposal on Tuesday, arguing it was just repackaging by Republicans to try to show they are show they are doing something. Democratic aides declined to give any details or readout on the White House lunch that included Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. They dined on salmon risotto. However, one senior House Democratic aide expressed skepticism at the GOP move to reach across the aisle and circulated press clips describing the Republican JOBS bill as simply a collection of items Democrats had already offered. With the economy finally showing signs of sustained recovery years after a crippling recession, congressional Republicans appeared to be shifting their main criticism of Obama to energy policy and rising gas prices. When Boehner was asked at the news conference about the assessment by another Congress member that people were feeling better about the economy, he acknowledged that the economy was \u201ca little better\u201d but said rising energy prices were a threat. \u201cThe president believed that there were some areas where we could find common ground and, frankly, I was encouraged by that,\u201d Boehner said of energy legislation. McConnell said it was up to Reid, as majority leader, to bring up some of the House-passed legislation on energy and jobs and break what he called \u201cthe bottleneck to accomplishing things on a bipartisan basis.\u201d Another issue discussed was the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands in northern Alberta to the Gulf Coast. Republicans blame Obama for putting off a decision on the pipeline until after the November election for political reasons, because his environmentalist supporters oppose the dirtier form of oil production and the risks of a long pipeline through ecologically sensitive regions. Obama, however, argues it was Nebraska officials, including the Republican governor, who delayed the project by calling for an alternative route to avoid an important water source. With no alternative route worked out, the president says, Republicans forced his administration to reject a permit application by requiring an immediate decision as part of a December agreement to temporarily extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. This week, the company building the pipeline said it would proceed with a section from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast that doesn\u2019t require federal approval and also reapply for permission to build the rest of the pipeline across the border from Canada. \u201cI did press the president on the Keystone pipeline. The president said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re going to get part of it,\u2019 \u201d Boehner told reporters. \u201cI just wish we were getting the part that would actually deliver the oil out of Canada and out of North Dakota.\u201d McConnell framed the issue as an election-year predicament for Obama, saying \u201cthere\u2019s really no reason not to create those jobs now, rather than after the president\u2019s election.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: President says critics are uninformed or dishonest on gas prices NEW: Obama defends his administration's \"all of the above\" energy policy Speech comes at a time when gasoline prices are soaring Fuel prices rose more than 3 cents nationwide overnight President Barack Obama said Thursday his Republican critics promising immediate lower gas prices are either uninformed or dishonest, and he pledged in a speech to University of Miami students to continue pushing for alternative energy sources. Framing the issue as \u201cone of the major challenges of your generation,\u201d Obama said developing a broad-based energy policy incorporating all sources \u2013 oil, gas, nuclear, solar, wind and alternatives such as algae \u2013 would take years but was essential for the nation\u2019s future economic well-being. His speech came as gas prices soared around the nation, rising 3.3 cents nationwide overnight to $3.61 a gallon, according to AAA. GOP presidential challenger Newt Gingrich and other Republicans complain Obama is bowing to foreign oil suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and the environmental lobby by not fully exploiting U.S. oil reserves. At the Republican debate in Arizona on Wednesday night, Gingrich introduced himself by saying he had \u201cdeveloped a program for American energy so no future president will ever bow to a Saudi king again and so every American can look forward to $2.50 a gallon gasoline.\u201d Without naming Gingrich, Obama appeared to target that remark Thursday,  saying to cheers that \u201canyone who tells you we can drill our way out of this problem doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about \u2013 or just isn\u2019t telling you the truth.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to make phony election-year promises about lower gas prices,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhat\u2019s harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem. And it won\u2019t be solved in one year, it won\u2019t be solved in one term, it may not be solved in one decade.  But that\u2019s the kind of commitment we need right now.\u201d Republicans hit the road after debate Obama: GOP gas plan a 'bumper sticker' How high will gas prices go? He touted current U.S. oil production as being at its highest level in eight years, and he said U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports has decreased, dropping below 50% in 2010. Obama also listed steps taken under his energy policy, including approval for new nuclear plants; opening more territory including in the Arctic region to exploration and development; an agreement signed with Mexico this week to cooperate on developing oil and gas reserves along their maritime border; increasing fuel efficiency standards in cars and trucks, and developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power. Because of the new fuel standards, he said, in the middle of the next decade \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to fill up your car every two weeks instead of every week \u2013 something that, over time, will save the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump.\u201d \u201cAnd it means this country will reduce our oil consumption by more than 2 million barrels a day,\u201d Obama added to applause. \u201cThat\u2019s not only good for your pocketbook, that\u2019s good for the environment.\u201d He also made an obvious reference to the bankrupt Solyndra solar panel company that had received $500 million in federal loan guarantees, saying public investment in new technology doesn\u2019t pay off right away. \u201cSome technologies don\u2019t pan out, and some companies will fail,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut as long as I\u2019m president, I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.\u201d Repeating that external factors such as Middle East instability cause fluctuating oil prices, Obama insisted that \u201cthere isn\u2019t a silver bullet. There never has been.\u201d The rising gas price threatens to slow signs of consistent economic recovery in recent months, and Republican critics have focused on the issue as the November presidential election campaign heats up. Obama ridiculed that strategy, mentioning a news headline that said the rising gas price has Republicans \u201clicking their chops.\u201d \u201cOnly in politics do people root for  bad news,\u201d Obama said, saying the unlimited oil drilling advocated by Republicans won\u2019t solve America\u2019s long-term energy needs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a strategy to solve our energy challenge,\u201d he continued to applause. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategy to get politicians through an election.  You know there are no quick fixes to this problem, and you know we can\u2019t just drill our way to lower gas prices.\u201d Before the speech, Obama toured the university\u2019s Industrial Assessment Center, where students learn how to help manufacturers reduce energy costs. The government should support such research and innovation, the president said in his speech, and he called for extending tax credits for consumers who take steps such as improving their home energy efficiency. \u201cThis Congress needs to renew the clean energy tax credits that will lead to more jobs and less dependence on foreign oil,\u201d Obama said. He also called for ending billions of dollars in tax subsidies for oil companies. \u201cThese are the same oil companies that have been making record profits off the money you spend at the pump for several years,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHow do they deserve another $4 billion in subsidies from taxpayers? It\u2019s outrageous. It\u2019s inexcusable.\u201d In another dig at Republican opponents, Obama added that \u201cevery politician who\u2019s been fighting to keep these subsidies in place should explain to the American people why the oil industry needs more of their money, especially at a time like this.\u201d",
