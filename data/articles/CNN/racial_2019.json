            "article_content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday expanding his administration\u2019s interpretation of race and national origin to include Judaism \u2013 a move that extends certain civil rights protections to Jews in education settings. The move is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader efforts to combat what it considers anti-Israel and anti-Semitic movements on college campuses. But the order has ignited debate over federal funding, free speech and views about Israel, and prompted renewed questions about how Jewish people should be classified by the government. The order concerns a section of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 requiring federally funded educational institutions not to discriminate based on national origin. Under this order, colleges and universities that support or tolerate anti-Israel movements \u2013 the most prominent being Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) \u2013 could be under threat of having their funding withheld by the Department of Education. While protections from racial, color and national origin discrimination are covered under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, religious discrimination is not. In the past, the Education Department has nevertheless interpreted the law to protect students of any religion from discrimination based on shared ethnic, racial or national origin. As a 2010 letter from the Justice Department to the Education Department\u2019s civil rights office laid out, Title VI protects religious students when discrimination \u201cis based on the group\u2019s actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, rather than its members\u2019 religious practice.\u201d The order would reinforce the inclusion of anti-Semitic conduct in this interpretation of national-origin-based discrimination for which students are afforded protection. There has been an uptick of reported incidents of anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism or assault on college campuses in recent years. The Anti-Defamation League found that the number of anti-Semitic incidents on campuses in 2017 was 204, up 89% from the previous year. That number stayed relatively steady in 2018, at 201 incidents. In addition to these incidents, college campuses have seen movements like BDS, which encourage international boycotts and sanctions against the state of Israel, emerge in the last decade. The initial organizers of BDS, according to the movement\u2019s official website, were Palestinian activists who have argued Israel is an apartheid state. While the ADL has avoided labeling BDS as anti-Semitic, the organization has argued that advocates for the movement \u201call too often \u2026 employ anti-Semitic rhetoric and narratives to isolate and demonize Israel.\u201d Opposition to BDS has been gaining political traction in Republican circles, including within Trump\u2019s evangelical Christian base, which is strongly supportive of Israel. Pro-Israel conservatives in the US have accused BDS of being anti-Semitic in origin and nature, and that its prominence on campuses is a threat to Jewish students. Sheldon Adelson, the casino mogul and Republican party megadonor, has also put a great deal of money behind combating BDS groups on campuses. And the administration has been signaling its own concerns about anti-Semitism on campuses. Attorney General William Barr, for example, mentioned the issue during a July conference on anti-Semitism. \u201cJewish students who support Israel are frequently targeted for harassment, Jewish student organizations are marginalized, and progressive Jewish students are told they must denounce their beliefs and their heritage in order be part of \u2018intersectional\u2019 causes,\u201d Barr said. According to the New York Times, which first reported on the Trump administration\u2019s plans, Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, has been pushing for this order internally. The language is very similar to legislation proposed in Congress directing the Education Department to include protection from anti-Israel and anti-Semitic discrimination in enforcing the Civil Rights Act. Members of both parties co-sponsored the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, which was first introduced in 2016, when it passed the Senate unanimously but was not taken up by the House of Representatives. The bill was reintroduced in both houses of Congress in 2018 and 2019. The definition of anti-Semitism in that bill tracks with the working definition adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2016. As a result, the US State Department has adopted this definition, which the administration says was built on its own working definition from 2010. Pretty much anything involving the Middle East, the Trump administration, discrimination, and federally funding for colleges is bound to attract controversy. Some Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, have expressed their support. \u201cIn a climate of rising anti-Semitism, this Executive Order provides valuable guidance on anti-Semitism, giving law enforcement and campus officials an important additional tool to help identify and fight this pernicious hate,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the ADL, in a statement Wednesday. But one major objection is that the order threatens free speech. J Street, a progressive Jewish organization, issued a statement blasting the expected executive order, saying it would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on criticism of Israel on campuses. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a non-ideological organization that defends college students\u2019 free speech, said the order \u201cwould threaten freedom of expression on campus.\u201d Palestinian groups in the United States have also expressed their opposition to the executive order. The US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, for example, has said it would \u201cembolden\u201d Kenneth Marcus, the Education Department\u2019s civil rights chief who the group calls a \u201cstaunch opponent of Palestinian rights.\u201d And while the Trump administration has made several policy decisions and moves that can be broadly interpreted as pro-Israel, the President\u2019s own comments do not always endear him to the American Jewish community, which already votes overwhelmingly Democratic. The executive order comes just days after several Jewish groups criticized Trump over a speech he delivered Saturday to an Israeli-American organization. The groups accused him of using anti-Semitic stereotypes. Speaking at the Israeli American Council National Summit in Florida, Trump suggested that many of the attendees at the event are wealthy and in real estate, and that their wealth would guide their votes in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cA lot of you are in the real estate business because I know you very well. You\u2019re brutal killers, not nice people at all. But you have to vote for me, you have no choice,\u201d he said. The President also admonished some Jewish Americans for not loving Israel \u201cenough.\u201d Trump drew similar condemnation during his 2016 presidential campaign when he told a group of Jewish Republicans, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me because I don\u2019t want your money.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A diversity paradox looms over the Democrats\u2019 hopes of recapturing the White House in 2020. The field of Democratic presidential candidates includes the most racial minorities ever, and more minorities will likely vote next year in the party\u2019s primaries than ever before. Yet four white contenders consistently lead in state and national polls, partly because of the outsized influence of the two virtually all-white states that lead off the election calendar, Iowa and New Hampshire. Those four white contenders \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2013 have also raised more money than any other candidates in the field. Monmouth poll shows tight race for Democratic nomination The same tensions are shaping the party\u2019s calculations about next November. With the country\u2019s minority population steadily growing, analysts in both parties expect that nonwhites will constitute their largest share of voters ever in the 2020 general election. Yet the overwhelming focus of most Democratic strategists is finding a way to reconnect three fallen bricks to the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wall\u201d across the Rust Belt: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Each is a preponderantly white state that has seen much slower growth in its minority population than the nation overall, much less such potential Sun Belt battleground states as North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Texas and above all, Arizona. It\u2019s all enough to make Democratic strategists who focus on communities of color feel as if they are caught in a time warp. Democrats \u201care trying to run the campaigns of 1992 or 1994 all over again,\u201d worries Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who has extensively studied African American voters. By any measure, minority voters remain indispensable to the strategies of all the Democratic presidential contenders, in the primaries and the general election. After Iowa and New Hampshire, the Democratic calendar runs through a concentration of states with large populations of nonwhite voters, starting with Nevada and South Carolina in later February and proceeding through Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona, among others, during the first weeks of March. Looking toward the general election, even party strategists who prioritize recapturing the three Rust Belt states that tipped to Trump consider increasing African American turnout a pivotal component of any successful strategy. The importance of minority voters to Democratic fortunes is also reflected in the widespread assumption that the party will pick a vice presidential nominee of color next year if a white contender wins the presidential nomination. But for both the primary and the general election, these considerations are only part of the story. For the general election, a significant block of nonwhite Democratic strategists worry that the eventual nominee will heavily favor the Rust Belt over potential Sun Belt battlegrounds for investments in time and money. They also fear that the focus on the Rust Belt by party leaders is encouraging primary voters to define electability more as the ability to recapture older blue-collar Midwestern white voters who backed Trump than to energize younger nonwhite Sun Belt voters who traditionally haven\u2019t voted at all. \u201cThere are probably like three legitimate different paths (to winning) that rely on different groups of voters,\u201d says Matt Barreto, co-founder of the Democratic polling firm Latino Decisions. \u201cIf you have a strategy based on flipping Arizona or Georgia, that is an energizing Latinos and African Americans story.\u201d And while all Democratic campaigns expect nonwhite voters, especially African Americans, to play a central role in picking the nominee, they could be choosing only among white candidates. That will happen if poor performances in preponderantly white Iowa and New Hampshire effectively winnow out the race\u2019s leading candidates of color: African American Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, Latino former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and Asian American entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Castro pinpointed that possibility over the weekend, when he argued that the party should break up the Iowa-New Hampshire duopoly, which has launched the Democratic nomination race in every contest since 1972. \u201cI actually believe that we do need to change the order of the states because I don\u2019t believe that we are the same country we were in 1972,\u201d Castro said on MSNBC Sunday night. While he praised voters in both states for carefully considering the candidates, he said that demographically they are \u201cnot reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party.\u201d There\u2019s no question Iowa and New Hampshire do not reflect the Democratic Party\u2019s modern diversity. In 2016, minorities cast just 9% of the votes in the Iowa caucuses and 7% in the New Hampshire primary, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of news organizations that include CNN. Nationally, in sharp contrast, minorities cast 38% of the votes last time across all of the Democratic primaries and caucuses with exit polls, according to a cumulative analysis by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. That number could easily cross 40% in 2020, given the minority population\u2019s continued growth and the increased political engagement those voters displayed in the 2018 election. Conscious of the widening demographic gulf, Democrats moved starting in 2008 to mitigate the influence of Iowa and New Hampshire by scheduling Nevada and South Carolina immediately behind them on the primary calendar. In 2008 and 2016, the two contested nomination fights since then, those shifts did change the dynamics. While the candidates have not competed in Nevada as heavily as the first two states, South Carolina \u2013 where a majority of votes are cast by African Americans \u2013 has emerged as a major battleground whose winners (Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016) ultimately won the nomination. Even this year, some Democratic strategists argue that the South Carolina result is more likely to predict the eventual nominee than the winner in Iowa or New Hampshire if those states favor a candidate, such as Warren or Buttigieg, who has struggled to attract African American voters. But if the party\u2019s changing demography means that Iowa and New Hampshire may not pick the winner this year, their capacity to winnow out losers appears undiminished. And that\u2019s the point of concern for Castro and some minority activists. They fear that because voters in succeeding states take their cues on which candidates are still viable from the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, the diverse contenders in the field may be effectively marginalized by poor showings there before minority voters have to chance to weigh in. South Carolina Republicans vote to skip 2020 primary Few Democratic strategists dispute that the diverse candidates could suffer that fate. But many say that possibility derives more from the flaws in those candidates\u2019 campaigns than in the primary system itself. \u201cI reject the structural problem, because out of the same structure came Barack Obama, who beat a front-runner (Hillary Clinton) who was a lot more formidable than any front-runner in modern political history,\u201d says Belcher. \u201cLots of people run for office; sometimes you catch fire, sometimes you don\u2019t. I have no qualms about calling out structural racism and sexism when I see it. And this is not it.\u201d Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist whose experience with the Iowa caucuses dates to the 1980s, likewise says it is harder to argue that Iowa and New Hampshire are unfairly undermining Booker, Harris and Castro because they have not shown consistent appeal to minority voters in the later states. The latest Charleston Post and Courier-Change Research Poll, for instance, put Harris fourth in South Carolina and showed her drawing just 17% of African Americans there, far behind Biden\u2019s 38%. A Monmouth University poll in the state around the same time found her drawing only single-digit support among African Americans. The latest Nevada Independent survey showed Castro drawing just 1% overall in Nevada and only 2% among Hispanics, far behind Biden\u2019s 34%. \u201cThe thing that (the case against Iowa and New Hampshire) misses is that none of the diverse candidates are performing well even in their own community,\u201d says Trippi. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not a fair read again because I think Kamala and Booker have had more than a fair chance in South Carolina and other places to move. And she was moving at one point and she has fallen off the charts.\u201d Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a group focused on organizing women of color, says the candidates of color in the field still have time to rejuvenate their campaigns. And even if they don\u2019t, she notes, the rising influence of minority voters is evident in the increased emphasis that the leading white candidates have placed on issues of racial justice, concerns that Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg alike were not known for stressing until this year. \u201cYou have a set of candidates \u2026 who have had to evolve as individual leaders and in the policies they are presenting in order to motivate and attract a coalition that is heavily driven by people of color,\u201d she notes. But Allison shares the frustration of other minority activists that much of the party appears to be defining electability primarily as the ability to win back the closely contested Rust Belt states by recapturing blue-collar white voters. That focus has undeniably boosted Biden\u2019s candidacy, especially among older voters of all races, despite his personal struggles as a candidate. Voters' views of impeachment still forming in a key 2020 battleground One year before Election Day, the general consensus among Democratic strategists is that the shortest and surest path to recapturing the White House is by flipping the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Trump won by a combined 80,000 votes last time. Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic election analyst and co-author of a recent Center for American Progress study on the changing demography of the 2020 electorate, spoke for many when he recently told me that \u201cit does seem like the right path\u201d to stress those three states, while investing in Arizona as a backup if Democrats can\u2019t recapture Wisconsin. Virtually no one in the Democratic Party argues against prioritizing Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2020. But Allison, like other skeptics, says the emphasis on those states still raises two interrelated questions. One is whether the focus on them will diminish attention to opportunities in more diverse Sun Belt states. The second is whether focusing on blue-collar whites, rather than turning out more young people and minorities and wooing more college-educated whites, is the best way to win even those states. \u201cYou can\u2019t just invest in those three Midwest states,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you are going to win those three Midwest states you have to focus on people of color in general and women of color in particular.\u201d Reflecting that perspective, Allison\u2019s group has launched an effort to organize women of color in seven potential battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin along with North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia and Texas. She passionately argues that Democrats should not just lay siege to the first group of states while downplaying the second. Given the gains that Democrats notched in the 2018 elections in Arizona, Georgia and Texas, she says, \u201cthis is not the time to hedge our bets.\u201d It\u2019s far from guaranteed, though, that the decision-makers in the Democratic Party will agree. Looking toward the general election, Arizona appears likely to become a top-tier Democratic target \u2013 if only, as Teixeira puts it, as \u201cinsurance\u201d against the risk that Wisconsin in particular proves too difficult to dislodge from Trump. And any Democrat is certain to seriously contest Florida, whose elections are routinely decided by achingly narrow margins, and possibly North Carolina (though likely to a lesser extent than previously, given Trump\u2019s strong showing there in 2016.) But it\u2019s much less certain Democrats next year will seriously invest in the emerging opportunities in Georgia, much less Texas. Both still lean Republican, and Texas, in particular, would demand enormous resources. But the opportunity in Texas for Democrats is also considerable: Barreto projects that as many as 800,000 more Texas Latinos could vote in 2020 than in 2016, given the huge pool of eligible but unregistered potential voters in that community. Combined with the Democrats\u2019 improved performance among well-educated suburban whites, such a Hispanic turnout surge, if Democrats can engineer it, would make the state highly competitive. The problem is generating such a Latino turnout surge would require a level of organizational investment \u2013 and eventually time from the presidential candidate \u2013 that Democrats will be reluctant to commit to a state that still leans away from them. Over time, Democratic priorities are likely to tilt more toward the Sun Belt. In an era when Trump has steered the Republican message and agenda so heavily toward the racial anxieties and cultural preferences of older blue-collar whites, Democrats will inexorably face a greater threat in states across the industrial Midwest with large numbers of those voters. That will increase the pressure on Democrats to generate gains in congressional and presidential elections in the rapidly growing, younger and more racially diverse states across the Sun Belt. Teixeira expresses a widespread party consensus when he says Sun Belt states such as Arizona, Georgia and Texas \u201care going to be brutally fought over in the 2020s.\u201d But in 2020, that future appears likely to remain sublimated to a Democratic strategy that still views the big Rust Belt prizes as the race\u2019s central battlefield. And unless something significantly changes before the party begins voting in February, the most diverse Democratic coalition ever will be marching onto that battlefield behind the banner of another white presidential nominee.",

            "article_content": "Ask LGBTQ voters what they think about 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg and (surprise) you\u2019ll receive a mix of answers \u2013 some enthusiastic, others more tepid. Maybe: I never imagined that a gay candidate would be viable. It\u2019s vital to have someone who can talk about LGBTQ issues the way he can. The politics and pieties he embodies are unnerving. His husband, though. Responses like these aren\u2019t necessarily at odds with one another. In fact, taken together, they reveal how the South Bend mayor \u2013 who would be the first nominee of a major political party who publicly identifies as gay \u2013 has become a vehicle through which LGBTQ voters are parsing the state of queer politics. One of the more obvious attachments some of these voters have to Buttigieg centers on the welcome surprise that he\u2019s a serious contender, period. After all, this is the same country in which homosexuality wasn\u2019t declassified as a mental illness until 1973. The same country that, in the 1980s and \u201990s, at best was indifferent toward people with HIV/AIDS \u2013 including gay men \u2013 and at worst pointed the finger of blame at them. The same country that still doesn\u2019t know what federal law should say about LGBTQ rights. \u201cI think that for people who\u2019ve lived through the horrors of the last 30 or 35 years of gay history and the progress of the last 20 years, Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy is very moving,\u201d journalist and film historian Mark Harris, who is 55 years old and gay, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s very moving in a way that isn\u2019t if, say, you\u2019re in your 20s and grew up with HIV as a fact of life but didn\u2019t see friends die every month, or grew up with gay marriage as a fact of life rather than as something that had to be fought for.\u201d   For a number of gay Americans of a certain generation, then, a meaningful part of Buttigieg\u2019s appeal is that his campaign represents a sort of personal ballast for a lifetime of dehumanization through casual and state-sanctioned homophobia. It\u2019s why some bristle at claims that he\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d \u2013 at suggestions that he doesn\u2019t belong \u2013 and why even something as ostensibly unremarkable as the public affection he shows for his husband, Chasten, has a radical power to it, bringing long-concealed gay love into the open. (\u201cMy jaw still drops a little at that,\u201d Harris said.) Indeed, there\u2019s a feeling of having successfully smuggled one of our own into the race \u2013 someone who has an intimately familiar understanding of gayness and, propelled by this experience, can use it as a social force for the wider LGBTQ community. But who\u2019s the our, in this instance? As the 2020 presidential election draws nearer, a tension that\u2019s become increasingly apparent is the one between Buttigieg\u2019s efforts to secure support from key segments of the Democratic base on the one hand, and the reemergence of alienating narratives on the other. Over the summer, focus groups were conducted in South Carolina to assess Buttigieg\u2019s relationship with black voters in the state. An internal campaign memo that surfaced in October found, among other things, that \u201cbeing gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. \u2026 (T)heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center.\u201d (The Buttigieg campaign said that it didn\u2019t authorize the release of the memo and disagrees with some of the results.) The memo immediately touched a raw nerve, with many black LGBTQ voters and their allies underscoring how it flattened black Americans and \u2013 along with media outlets and popular figures \u2013 appeared to tacitly endorse the notion that they\u2019re singularly anti-gay. \u201cThe black voters are homophobic narrative is my second favorite after The Southern Strategy!!!!!\u201d writer and podcaster Ira Madison III tweeted. \u201cThis reads as \u2018the Black community is homophobic\u2019 as if ANY community isn\u2019t. And it doesn\u2019t really explore Buttigieg\u2019s own problematic history as mayor re: policing,\u201d analyst Preston Mitchum wrote, referring to Buttigieg\u2019s tremulous handling of racial division in South Bend. And according to Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, \u201cThere are clear answers to why Black voters don\u2019t back (Buttigieg\u2019s) campaign, and homophobia ain\u2019t it.\u201d Will the Equality Act reframe how we talk about LGBTQ Americans? Likewise, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who also is vying for the Democratic nomination, told CNN earlier this month: \u201cTo label one community in particular as being burdened by this bias as compared to others is misinformed, it\u2019s misdirected and it\u2019s just simply wrong.\u201d In this light, Buttigieg is a more complicated emblem: of how various hierarchies can replicate within LGBTQ communities in ways both blatant and imperceptible, in turn congealing the status quo. (A quote from writer James Baldwin is appropriate here: \u201cThe gay world as such is no more prepared to accept black people than anywhere else in society. It\u2019s a very hermetically sealed world with very unattractive features, including racism.\u201d) For his part, Buttigieg has sought to turn his own experience of separateness into solidarity on the campaign trail, though some continue to wonder whether he\u2019s the most fluent candidate on the expansive range of realities composing contemporary LGBTQ life. Crucially, none of this is limited to Democrats\u2019 fight for the nomination. The different readings of Buttigieg are a piece of a broader conversation among many LGBTQ voters: the direction of the movement \u2013 where the moderate mayor, who isn\u2019t from the activist tradition, would lead it. In April, writer and AIDS historian Sarah Schulman wrote a series of trenchant tweets that distilled some of the anxieties found in present-day queer discourse on this score. \u201cOver 100 years of queer activism, the national cataclysm of 600,000 dead of AIDS, the sacrifices of front line people giving up the privileges of the closet and paying a high price \u2013 all this sacrifice results in society changing in ways that are both large and very small,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe lost the fight to expand sexual and relational options for all, and won acceptance based on marriage as the sign of legitimacy.\u201d And: \u201cWe lost the fight against militarism and ended up with a candidate whose legitimacy is rooted in being a voluntary veteran of an immoral war.\u201d And: \u201cWe lost the fight to see homosexuality as a variety of experiences and instead end up with legitimacy rooted in the idea that God makes us gay.\u201d Schulman\u2019s point wasn\u2019t to knock Buttigieg. Rather, it was to wrestle with how his portrayal of his sexuality shapes the national understanding of queer issues and identities. As a 29-year-old gay black man \u2013 that is, as someone who\u2019s too young to remember queerness as an identity defined significantly by defeated desire and death but also old enough to know of the movement\u2019s achievements and that the work is far from over \u2013 I find mining these different perspectives cathartic and even necessary. That\u2019s because LGBTQ voters, in this moment, are confronting and provoking and inspecting themselves in a newly visible way. More specifically, they\u2019re making it clear that, as with any other group, they\u2019re worthy of hard truths and knotty politics \u2013 of the complexity that\u2019s always been held just outside their reach. Or as Mark Harris put it: \u201cWe can\u2019t look at Buttigieg without looking at ourselves.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Thursday scored an endorsement from a group of more than 100 black women activists, who praised the Democratic presidential candidate as a leader on implementing structural changes. Black Womxn For released a lengthy statement and video \u201centhusiastically and wholeheartedly\u201d backing Warren for president. The endorsement comes one day after Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley endorsed Warren, splitting from her progressive freshman allies. \u201c(Warren) is a leader with a track record of taking on the predatory policies and practices that harm our communities and implementing structural changes that give power back to working people,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cShe is a partner with a deep understanding of how racism and gender discrimination don\u2019t just compound income inequality but are actually central to maintaining the status quo.\u00a0She is a woman who is willing to learn, open to new ideas, and ready to be held accountable by us and our communities,\u201d the statement continues. Warren tweeted: \u201cBlack trans and cis women, gender-nonconforming, and nonbinary people are the backbone of our democracy and I don\u2019t take this endorsement lightly. I\u2019m committed to fighting alongside you for the big, structural change our country needs.\u201d Warren has received public praise from black leaders and activists this election cycle, but it has yet to fully translate to support among\u00a0black voters. A Quinnipiac national poll released last month shows Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but former Vice President Joe Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%. Black Womxn For said the endorsement came after hundreds of conversations and surveys with black women, gender non-conforming and non-binary people found the \u201coverwhelming majority of excitement and support is for Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\u201d The group describes itself as a group of leaders, activists, artists, writers, and political strategists from across the country \u201cin the fight for Black Liberation.\u201d The statement reads: \u201cThough no one presidential contender can rectify the gross atrocities to which we\u2019ve become accustomed, there is one leader who has shown, through action, deed, and word, that a future of economic prosperity, racial justice, gender justice, and social and political equity is possible.\u201d \u201cWe write this letter, not with the belief that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is a savior, but a stalwart who can be challenged when necessary, moved when appropriate, and held accountable to a base led by Black community leaders,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe endorse her with the complete recognition that, upon her victory, the work is not over, nor is it just the beginning.\u201d The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans. Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines, including her student loan debt forgiveness plan, her housing proposal, and plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color.

            "article_content": "The outcome of races in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia on Tuesday could shed light on how the country is leaning in the middle of an impeachment inquiry and as it heads into a presidential election year. As the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump deepens in Washington, voters will head to the polls a year after Democrats took the US House, testing the political landscape. Voters will decide the next governors of Kentucky and Mississippi, two solidly red states that voted for Trump in 2016. The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. All eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state\u2019s attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear. Trump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor\u2019s office in the state. Trump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin\u2019s victory came within 10 points of his opponent. Medicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements. In 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell. Beshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. Polls close at 6 p.m. local time. Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection. Trump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor\u2019s office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi. Cook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \u201clikely Republican\u201d to \u201cleans Republican,\u201d indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood\u2019s appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi. Hood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. There is an unusual aspect to the state\u2019s election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi\u2019s 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner. Vice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats\u2019 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats\u2019 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins. Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census. Democrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner, Adam Levy, Ethan Cohen and Liz Stark contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It was a study in contrasts. Over the weekend, at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum hosted at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, a black student asked Bernie Sanders how he\u2019d advise him if he were his son and stopped by the police. \u201cI would do my best to identify who that police officer is \u2013 in a polite way ask him or her for their name. I would respect what they are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head,\u201d the Vermont senator said, also noting the significance of police accountability. When asked a similar question by a young black woman, former Vice President Joe Biden didn\u2019t miss a beat: \u201cIf you were my daughter, you would be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn\u2019t be pulled over. \u2026 What I\u2019d tell you is: That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong. That is what\u2019s wrong. There is institutional racism that still exists.\u201d And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts began her response by pointing out, \u201cI had to have a lot of talks with my kids, but I never had to have one about what to do if you get pulled over by the police because the risks are greater for you because of the color of your skin.\u201d The 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls\u2019 answers distill the kinds of bleak, though important, conversations black parents have been having with their black children for generations. But one thing that makes Sanders\u2019 comment stand out is the word \u201crespect.\u201d   For one, it\u2019s semantically slippery, especially at a political moment when the man occupying the White House has weaponized it against black Americans \u2013 has used it to tap into the tradition of pathologizing them and their perceived bad behavior. Think of how a common \u2013 and predictable \u2013 criticism of the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began publicly protesting police violence, is that his defiance reveals a \u201clack of respect\u201d for his country. For another, Sanders\u2019 reply, at least without a meaningful nod to the racial hierarchies that partly govern America, also seems to assume, quietly, that \u201crespect\u201d can act as a shield. Indeed, in recent years, much of the fury over the racial dimension of police violence has centered precisely on how the actual threat of black Americans tends to matter very little during encounters with law enforcement. That Eric Garner had no weapon didn\u2019t protect him. Neither did the fact that Philando Castile, who was in a parked car, was restrained by a seat belt. Respect, in other words, isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s, well, racism, and the latter is all too easily exploited under the guise of the former. None of this is to suggest that Sanders isn\u2019t committed to the pursuit of racial justice. His history of civil rights activism and his present-day messaging on race, which is demonstrably better than it was during the 2016 presidential election, make clear where the senator stands. What\u2019s more, Biden and Warren\u2019s answers seemed to approach the question differently. While they avoided the thick weeds of black respectability politics, Sanders arguably responded as a black parent who, above all, wants his child to return home. Still, the conversation over the weekend cast a telling light on the candidates\u2019 varying levels of comfort with grappling \u2013 deeply, fundamentally and head-on \u2013 with America\u2019s unbending legacy of racism. And some appear to be more up to the task than others.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story was originally published on October 22. It has been updated with Trump\u2019s comments at Benedict College in South Carolina. Shall we skip right to the obvious? Virtually the only moments when President Donald Trump refers to the pain and persecution of a marginalized group are when he\u2019s talking about his own perceived suffering. Consider, for instance, Trump\u2019s penchant for using the term \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d which he has tossed around hundreds of times since assuming office. Lately, he has tended to employ the phrase to characterize former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election or the current House impeachment probe. But \u201cwitch hunt\u201d has a gendered past \u2013 and present. \u201cRecent events show that men with political and economic power can often rely on the idea of witch hunts to work for them, not against them,\u201d as the political scientist Erin C. Cassese wrote for Vox last year. \u201cThe witch hunt still uses institutional authority to enforce traditional gender norms and power relations.\u201d   Twice this week, the President has made comparisons in a similar vein, likening specific examples of bigotry and racial disparity to his own apparent anguish. \u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday about the ongoing, legal impeachment inquiry. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d On Friday, while speaking at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, Trump appeared to juxtapose his \u201cown experience\u201d with unfair treatment to the continued structural inequality and racism black Americans face within the criminal justice system, saying that he\u2019s being confronted with \u201can investigation in search of a crime.\u201d Except: His tweet papered over lynching\u2019s role as a distinct form of racial terrorism used significantly against black Americans, and his claim at Benedict left out how criminal justice in this country is fundamentally uneven. And yet, these latest iterations of Trump\u2019s queasy, woe-is-me appropriation of victimhood (or as the journalist Jacob Brogan put it for The New Republic in 2017, his invocation of abject helplessness) aren\u2019t surprising. That\u2019s because they\u2019re of a piece with a larger pattern, which is that he cares about black experiences \u2013 broadly, abstractly \u2013 only when they\u2019re to his benefit. After all, this is the same President who called places such as Haiti \u201cshithole countries,\u201d excoriated four congresswomen of color by telling them to \u201cgo back\u201d to \u201cthe totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\u201d and pointedly dismissed majority-black Baltimore as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d But who also then spoke in bizarre terms of \u201cmy African American\u201d (notably, said person, Gregory Cheadle, has since left the Republican Party), made much of his job approval rating among black Americans (a mere 9%, according to a CNN/SSRS poll) when he pandered to a black audience, and publicly praised the far-right pundit Candace Owens as a \u201cstar.\u201d Which is at least partly why Democrats \u2013 traditionally the go-to for black voters \u2013 and some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, in particular, have moved quickly to call Trump out, especially on his lynching remark. \u201cLynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation\u2019s history, as is this President,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris of California tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey: \u201cLynching is an act of terror used to uphold white supremacy. Try again.\u201d Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas: \u201cThe legacy of slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and suppression is alive and well in every part of this country \u2013 including in the White House where the president is a white supremacist.\u201d Republicans\u2019 reactions to Trump\u2019s tweet have been decidedly more mixed. Some, such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have condemned it, while others, such as House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, have expressed mild disagreement without outright rebuking it. Still others, such as Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, have defended Trump. Of course, Trump isn\u2019t the only one who reliably warps black lives and history in a self-serving manner \u2013 he\u2019s his own kind of microcosm of America. \u201cHow careless white America has been with black pain,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Karen Attiah tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cThe same careless spirit that allows Trump to compare lynching to a constitutional process. The same spirit that sees slave plantations as romantic venues. That spirit that loves black forgiveness after white violence.\u201d That said, Trump is perhaps the most obvious, most cavalier offender: Regardless of the past \u2013 including his own \u2013 the former reality television personality will always find a way to make himself the star of the story.",

            "article_content": "When Tom Stevens got an email from the White House saying that President Donald Trump was considering giving his grandfather, baseball legend Babe Ruth, a posthumous Medal of Freedom, he thought it was spam. \u201cThis email from the White House pops up and I put (it) in the same class as a Nigerian prince wanting me to help him liberate $5 million. I paid zero attention,\u201d Stevens, who often represents Ruth\u2019s family in public, told CNN. It wasn\u2019t until another email came in that Stevens saw the news. A few months later, he was standing in the East Room of the White House to receive his grandfather\u2019s award, which Trump has granted to more than a dozen supporters, conservative figures, athletes and deceased celebrities. Trump\u2019s selections for the Medal of Freedom \u2013 the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor \u2013 seem to vary greatly and the process is largely held under wraps. But some honorees gave CNN insight into how they were picked. A few were recommended for the award during previous administrations. Others say the selection seemed to be totally out of the blue. And others are close allies or friends of the President. Though President Barack Obama\u2019s Medal of Freedom list was long and diverse \u2013 with honorees who came from a variety of industries and racial backgrounds, and who were nearly equally male or female \u2013 Trump has opted for a different course. His honorees have been overwhelmingly male, predominantly white and a majority are also either Republican figures or athletes. In addition, Trump has opted for smaller ceremonies with individual honorees at the White House, rather than following Obama\u2019s preference for large-scale events with several honorees getting the medal at the same time. Asked for more information about the administration\u2019s Medal of Freedom selection process, a White House official told CNN that much like past administrations, \u201cthe office of the staff secretary coordinates decisions to award presidential medals.\u201d \u201cIn addition to receiving recommendations from the public and applicable presidential advisory bodies, the staff secretary has solicited nominees from the Cabinet and White House senior staff. These nominees are then vetted for presentation to the President,\u201d the official said. Stevens is not necessarily a Trump fan, but he said the Babe\u2019s nomination to receive the Medal of Freedom by Trump was \u201clong overdue.\u201d Ruth is among more than a dozen pro-baseball players to receive the award since it was established in its most modern iteration by President John F. Kennedy in 1963. \u201cThe family was most grateful to President Trump for having recognized \u2013 finally recognized, long overdue, pleased that the award was made,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cTo be a little bit special every once and in a while is a lot of fun.\u201d Ruth isn\u2019t the only recipient to obtain the award posthumously from Trump. Elvis Presley and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia were also given the award during a ceremony last year. Representatives for Graceland similarly were stunned to learn that Trump would be granting the award to Presley. Christian Ross, a spokesperson for Elvis Presley Enterprises, told CNN, \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or why the President chose to honor Elvis\u201d beyond what the White House had said in its public announcement for the award. Trump honors Reagan economist Arthur Laffer with Medal of Freedom Like Scalia, several conservative leaders among the Republican Party\u2019s ranks have made it onto Trump\u2019s list. More recently, the White House announced that Reagan-era Attorney General Edwin Meese will receive the Medal of Freedom. And retired Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who endorsed Trump ahead of the Republican National Convention in 2016, received the Medal of Freedom in 2018. Trump held his first Oval Office ceremony for famed economist Art Laffer, whose work gained popularity under the Reagan administration, this summer. Trump has diverged from some of his predecessors, who took to celebrating several Medal of Freedom honorees at large, public ceremonies inside the White House. The President has instead, in recent months, chosen to hold ceremonies for individual honorees, sometimes with limited press in the Oval Office. Laffer\u2019s concepts have been adopted by Trump administration officials, whom the economist calls friends, including White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow. Laffer also co-wrote a book with ex-Federal Reserve Board of Governors nominee Stephen Moore, titled \u201cTrumponomics,\u201d and is a self-labeled \u201cfan\u201d of Trump. Trump told Laffer he wanted to give him the Medal of Freedom \u201cout of the blue\u201d during a White House visit, Laffer told CNN, adding that he was \u201cquite taken aback\u201d by the President\u2019s announcement. At a subsequent meeting, Trump and Laffer joked about holding the ceremony with pro golfer Tiger Woods. \u201cHe asked, with a twinkle in his eye, \u2018Would you like to have it at the same time as Tiger Woods?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea,\u2019 \u201d Laffer remarked. He called the day of the Medal of Freedom ceremony a \u201cblur.\u201d \u201cWe met in the Roosevelt Room. They described what would happen (during the ceremony). I could barely follow it. I was just so giddy,\u201d Laffer said. The \u201cLaffer Curve\u201d creator said he also got the impression that he was among the President\u2019s personal selections, alongside Ruth, Presley and Woods. \u201cNow, what he said to me was that I was his choice \u2013 whether other people supported it or mentioned it or not \u2013 he said, \u2018I want you for it,\u2019 \u201d Laffer said, adding that Trump told him he didn\u2019t know why Ruth and Presley didn\u2019t previously get the award when they were \u201cmajor contributors to Americana.\u201d \u201cIt makes you feel really proud someone cares. You work all your life and you hope someone notices,\u201d Laffer added. Trump honors 'Mr. Basketball' with Medal of Freedom The President has honored several pro athletes with the medal since taking office, including former NFL star and Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page, former Boston Celtics point guard Bob Cousy, former Lakers player Jerry West, Woods, former Yankee Mariano Rivera and former NFL quarterback Roger Staubach. Page told CNN that he had been also contacted \u201csort of out of the blue\u201d about the medal, but said he thinks the decision for Trump to give him the award stems from a letter sent to the White House during the Obama administration in 2016. Page said the letter was signed by a group of current and former prominent Minnesota politicians. He is under the impression that Obama-era submissions for the medal, including Page\u2019s earlier recommendation, were screened by staff and submitted to Trump. Page said he has no connection to Trump. \u201cBeyond (the letter) I don\u2019t really know what or how or why\u201d I was selected, Page remarked, adding that it was \u201cquite an honor.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a way to say this,\u201d Page said, taking a pause. \u201cOne would not have anticipated that I would have been high on his list.\u201d In the span of a month earlier this year, moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, from West Virginia, was spotted at two Medal of Freedom ceremonies, first for Cousy and then West. Trump\u2019s public remarks from the ceremonies indicate that they were suggested for the award by Manchin. West is a West Virginia native, but Cousy is not. However, like Page, Cousy had been recommended by members of Congress from his home state of Massachusetts in letters to the White House in 2014 and 2017. Still, it appears that their letters did not have as much sway as Manchin\u2019s personal recommendation over the phone. Trump said during Cousy\u2019s Medal of Freedom ceremony that \u201cJoe called me up quite a while ago and suggested this idea,\u201d later calling Manchin \u201ca big part of this.\u201d Trump also maintains some personal and political connections to some of the recipients. He\u2019s known Woods for years, and was spotted with him on the links this year. Woods is also involved in some of Trump\u2019s businesses. Staubach is a self-described conservative who has donated to conservative causes. And Rivera is a vocal Trump supporter who sits on the President\u2019s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition. Trump bestows Medals of Freedom on Adelson, Babe Ruth, Elvis and others Rivera also co-sponsored a $50,000-per-couple, pro-Trump fundraiser in 2018, according to the New York Post. But no Medal of Freedom recipient has gotten as much scrutiny for their family\u2019s GOP donor ties as Miriam Adelson, the spouse of billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson. She was commended by the White House for her philanthropy, which includes founding research centers committed to fighting substance abuse and establishing the Adelson Medical Research Foundation, which supports research on life-threatening illness. The Adelsons were among the Republican Party\u2019s largest benefactors this midterm election, donating more than $100 million to GOP super PACs in 2018. It\u2019s not unheard-of for presidents to award the medal to supporters or campaign donors. Obama came under scrutiny for granting the award to Democratic donors during his tenure.",

            "article_content": "An agitated President Donald Trump on Tuesday branded the Democratic impeachment process a \u201clynching\u201d shortly before a crucial new witness is scheduled to give a deposition that could potentially unpeel new layers of the Ukraine scandal that is threatening his presidency. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat currently in Ukraine, is due at a closed-door session of three House committees and plans to fill in the gaps of his text messages with US diplomats about Ukraine, a source familiar with his testimony told CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb and Kylie Atwood. That\u2019ll offer new material for an ever-broadening investigation now threatening to dash Democratic hopes of swiftly wrapping up the entire impeachment process. Taylor will be asked about increasingly firm evidence that Trump was running an off-the-books foreign policy operation in Ukraine for personal political gain in a possible abuse of power. He arrived in Washington amid an evolving political environment. Half of all Americans now say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, according to a new CNN/SSRS poll. That\u2019s a new high in CNN polling on the topic and the first time that support for impeachment and removal has significantly outpaced opposition. Trump, who on Monday called on Republicans to be tougher in his defense, warned in a tweet that Democrats were setting a precedent that a president of their own party could be impeached in future without due process. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d Trump wrote. Trump\u2019s use of sharp racial language got a swift reaction from his opponents on Capitol Hill. Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass told CNN that Trump\u2019s lynching tweet is consistent with his pattern of throwing out \u201cracial bombs\u201d to throw \u201cred meat\u201d to his base when his back his against the wall. Rep. Harley Rouda, a California Democrat, called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201coffensive.\u201d It was impossible to judge the President\u2019s motivations for sure.  But it would not be the first time that the President has stoked a fierce controversy to take attention away from an event \u2013 in this case Taylor\u2019s appearance \u2013 that could be politically damaging for him. Paradoxically, the mountains of new evidence collected in recent days \u2013 mostly from depositions by career State Department officials \u2013 also threaten to make impeachment a more perilous political exercise for Democrats. A torrent of disclosures could dash hopes for a swift House vote on articles of impeachment before the Thanksgiving break as members follow fresh paths of inquiry beyond the original scope of questioning. That could in turn also hinder their effort to offer the public a crisp, easily understandable case against a President who habitually defies limits on his power. CNN reported Monday on growing expectations that historic votes on impeachment may now slip towards the end of the year \u2013 even as Democrats also move to begin doing weekend work with a scheduled Saturday deposition for another State Department official. Such a scenario would make it more likely that a subsequent Senate trial of the President could overshadow and infect the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential primary votes early next year, a time when party leaders hope voters will focus instead on considering their own candidates for President. During Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment process, for instance, it took two months between the House Judiciary Committee voting on Articles of Impeachment for him to be acquitted in the Senate. One option would be for Democrats to give up on building a broad case against Trump and rely mainly on recent testimony and a whistleblower report on Trump\u2019s behavior and a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky. Many Democrats believe that there is sufficient evidence in those documents alone to prove that Trump abused his power and committed high crimes and misdemeanors by trying to coerce Kiev into providing dirt on possible Democratic nominee Joe Biden. But such an approach risks depriving the public of the full scope of the President\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, weakening the case and easing pressure on Republican senators defending him. \u201cThere is a debate now \u2013 should we have a narrow inquiry or a broad one?\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, author of \u201cThe Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents.\u201d \u201cThe choice I do think they shouldn\u2019t make \u2013 is a narrow inquiry. They don\u2019t want to miss the many abuses of power that are going on here.\u201d Given that Democrats appear far from wrapping up private depositions, may want to call new witnesses from multiple agencies, hope to publish transcripts of hours-long depositions and also want to hold public hearings, it is tough to see them advancing Articles of Impeachment in the committee next month. As a case in point, the top US diplomat currently in Ukraine Bill Taylor is scheduled to deliver a deposition to three House committees on Tuesday. The US charge d\u2019affaires in Kiev was depicted in text message exchanges with the President\u2019s men as saying it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold military aid to the former Soviet state to coerce it into offer political favors. So he\u2019s potentially a critical witness for impeachment managers. Other officials are also on the deposition list in the coming days. And testimony last week by Trump\u2019s former top Russia hand Fiona Hill \u2013 that for the first time exposed the depth of Trump\u2019s Ukraine operation \u2013 raised the possibility that former national security adviser John Bolton could be called for blockbuster testimony. Even a delay of weeks on the tight self-imposed impeachment timetable could have significant knock on effects. It now seems all but inevitable that at the time when Democrats hoped to focus voters on plans for health care reform, lowering student debt and a fairer economy in the run up to the Iowa caucuses in February, the nation\u2019s attention will still be fixated on Washington. A prolonged impeachment saga could begin to test public patience for the decision by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to proceed with impeachment in the first place and erode Democratic leverage and even cause a voter backlash. It could also give Trump more time to unleash his disinformation campaign in alliance with conservative media to discredit the investigation \u2014 as he did effectively with the Mueller probe. If the increasingly complicated case against Trump makes a swift denouement impractical, Democrats may begin to doubt Pelosi\u2019s decision to hold off on impeachment months ago \u2013 after the special counsel provided what some scholars see as strong evidence of obstruction of justice. Trump\u2019s defenders could soon begin to make the case soon that a decision to overturn an election should best be left to voters due to weigh in months, rather than lawmakers on Capitol Hill. But Democrats will not be alone in facing dangerously shifting political currents should impeachment drag on longer than expected. After all, every week that has passed since Pelosi fired the starting gun a month ago has weakened Trump\u2019s position. It\u2019s possible that day after day of damaging disclosures about Trump\u2019s off-the-books dealings with Ukraine to get dirt on Biden could significantly weaken the President\u2019s position. That might not just begin to turn public opinion \u2013 increasingly in favor of at least investigating the President \u2013 it could considerably increase the political price that GOP senators will pay to save the President in a Senate trial. Vulnerable Senate GOPers like Maine\u2019s Susan Collins and Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner won\u2019t welcome delays that could leave a vote to acquit Trump fresh in voters\u2019 minds next November. Events of the last few days \u2013 over Trump\u2019s aborted plan for a G7 summit at his Florida resort and his Syria withdrawal \u2013 have exposed increasing GOP impatience with the President. While there is no suggestion that his Senate firewall is in danger of collapsing, it appears that Trump will continue to fray tempers in the months before a Senate trial. \u201cWe have to get tougher and fight,\u201d Trump warned his party on Monday in a wild hour-long photo-op before a cabinet meeting. Appropriate behavior for a President facing impeachment might be to act in a way designed to cause his own party the minimum possible embarrassment. That\u2019s not Trump\u2019s way. He caused more cringing on his own side by blasting the \u201cphony\u201d emoluments clause of the Constitution and by taking George Washington\u2019s name in vain on Monday. Many more weeks before a Senate impeachment trial bring the possibility that the incorrigible President could commit more conduct that could add to the case against him. While Republicans many not break against Trump after months of political pressure, he\u2019s bound to infuriate his own side even more as the bitter historic pill of impeachment beckons. \u201c(There is) growing frustration in the Republican Party, growing disenchantment in the Republican Party, but we haven\u2019t seen a real breakout and we may not see one through this process,\u201d David Gergen, an adviser to GOP and Democratic presidents who is now a senior CNN political analyst, told CNN International on Monday.",

            "article_content": "Every leading Democratic presidential candidate now supports a renewed ban on assault-style weapons, an issue that the party has considered too hot to touch for most of the past quarter-century. But House Democrats, who are preparing for their first legislative hearing Wednesday on the issue in years, remain just short of the 218 votes needed to pass such a ban on the floor. The contrast between the presidential candidates\u2019 aggressive embrace of a federal ban and the palpable caution of House Democratic leaders illuminates the enormously complex and challenging legislative landscape still confronting gun control advocates, even as polls now consistently show clear national majorities in support for the major components of their agenda, including a ban on assault-style weapons. The disparity is reminiscent of the gap between the fulsome rhetoric from leading Democratic presidential candidates about \u201cMedicare for all\u201d or a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and the more modest support each measure has attracted in the House. The bill to ban assault-style weapons remains short of a majority largely because of hesitance among just a few Democrats representing districts that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, especially those with large blue-collar constituencies, according to a new CNN analysis of support for the legislation sponsored by Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline. While fully 95% of House Democrats in districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 have endorsed Cicilline\u2019s bill, almost half of the Democrats in districts won by Trump in 2016 have not signed onto the legislation, the CNN analysis found. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough issue for some people,\u201d Cicilline said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI respect that people are making judgments based on what they think their constituents expect them to do, or they come to places where there are very different attitudes about firearms generally. We are a big caucus, a diverse caucus\u201d Few issues in the gun control debate generate more emotional on either side than the prospect of banning the assault-style weapons such as the AR-15 that have been repeatedly used in mass shootings. When Republicans won control of the House in 1994 for the first time in four decades, many Democrats attributed the defeat partly to the legislation they passed that year banning assault style weapons. Gun control advocacy groups this year are prioritizing other bills \u2013 particularly the \u201cuniversal background check\u201d legislation the House passed earlier this year and \u201cred flag\u201d laws to confiscate guns from owners who show signs of presenting a danger. But some advocates worry that it will signal weakness and embolden gun owner groups led by the National Rifle Association if the House cannot pass an assault ban while the Democratic presidential candidates are so loudly touting the idea-and in some cases even moving past it to propose, as former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has done, a mandatory buyback of the estimated 15 million assault-style weapons already in circulation. \u201cDespite the fact that assault weapons are only a small, but very visceral part of the gun violence mix, a lot of our base looks at that issue as very representative of gun control,\u201d said one leading gun control advocate who asked for anonymity to discuss the movement\u2019s internal political calculations. \u201cAnd they are going to start asking questions about the ironclad commitment of Democrats to follow through on this if we don\u2019t move it.\u201d The counterargument from other gun control advocates is that it doesn\u2019t make sense to push the wavering House Democrats to pass an assault ban this year knowing that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is already blocking a vote on the House\u2019s universal background check bill, will not allow it to come to a vote there. Some argue for delaying a vote until 2021 if Democrats win the White House next year so vulnerable House Democrats would have to vote only once for a ban on assault-style weapons. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make members in very marginal districts take a vote that\u2019s useless,\u201d says Matt Bennett, a veteran of pro-gun control groups who now serves as executive vice president for public affairs at the centrist Democratic group Third Way. \u201cI think if there was hope for it in the Senate, Speaker Pelosi would force them to do it.\u201d Caught between these competing considerations, Cicilline\u2019s bill HR 1296 remains stuck in a revealing legislative limbo. The bill has support from 208 Democratic co-sponsors and one Republican \u2013 New York Rep. Peter King. Counting Cicilline and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who in that role doesn\u2019t co-sponsor legislation but would surely back the bill if it came to the floor, that means the legislation has 211 votes, just seven short of what it needs to pass. Two other Republicans have expressed general support for a ban on assault-style weapons, though they have not put their name on the legislation. Only 25 House Democrats in all, leaving aside Pelosi, have so far refused to endorse the bill \u2013 but that\u2019s enough to keep it just short of a majority. \u201cWe will continue to get support and continue to build toward that 218,\u201d Cicilline said in the interview. \u201cI continue to think we will get there.\u201d But Cicilline acknowledges \u201cit\u2019s still up in the air\u201d whether the bill will ever come to a floor before the 2020 election. \u201cObviously it will be a decision made by the Speaker,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her directly about it, and I won\u2019t do that until I have 218 votes. I need to be able to say with certainty that I have the votes before I ask the Speaker to bring the bill to the floor.\u201d Both the level of support that Cicilline has attracted for his bill, and the difficulty he faces in crossing the last mile to a majority, testify to the evolving politics of gun control. The support he\u2019s attracted from so many Democrats captures one key dynamic: Compared to the last time Congress seriously considered gun control legislation in the 1990s, Democrats are far more unified today in supporting such measures. During Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, fully 69 House Democrats voted against the 1993 Brady Bill establishing the national background check system for purchases at gun stores, and 77 opposed the initial assault ban which Congress approved and Clinton signed in 1994. (The legislation had a ten-year sunset provision, and the Republican-controlled Congress allowed the ban to expire when it came due in 2004.) The widespread opposition to both measures reflected a Democratic caucus that, at that point, still included dozens of members from rural, blue-collar and southern districts where the gun culture, and the NRA, were strong. (Both bills required strong crossover support from suburban Republicans to pass the House.) Even as late as 2009-2010, the last time Democrats controlled the House before this year, resistance from the remaining Democrats in such swing areas dissuaded the party from considering any new gun control measures. But, as working-class white voters have become the foundation of the Republican coalition, Democrats lost many of their seats in such areas during the GOP congressional sweeps in the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections. When Democrats rebuilt their House majority in 2018, they did so primarily by winning urban and white-collar suburban seats in metropolitan areas where support for gun control is strong. That\u2019s allowed the party to achieve a level of consensus on gun issues unimaginable even a decade ago. Earlier this year, just two House Democrats opposed legislation the chamber passed imposing a \u201cuniversal background check\u201d requirement for all gun sales. Only seven voted against a measure to close the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d in the Brady Bill background check system. House Democratic leaders and gun control advocates are confident they will also coalesce preponderant Democratic support for the package of gun control bills the House Judiciary Committee approved earlier this month. Those bills, expected to reach the floor later this fall, would provide grants to states to strengthen \u201cred flag\u201d laws (also known as \u201cextreme risk protection orders\u2019) that allow courts to confiscate guns from individuals deemed dangerous; prevent individuals convicted of hate crimes from possessing firearms; and ban high capacity ammunition magazines that have been used in some mass shootings. But the uncertain prospects of Cicilline\u2019s assault ban legislation suggests that the Democrats\u2019 new consensus on guns still faces stubborn legislative limits rooted in the geography of its House majority. Though the House Democratic caucus is increasingly centered on metropolitan seats that are trending toward them, the last few districts that provide the party its majority include suburban seats and a handful of rural and blue-collar places that are at best evenly divided and more often lean slightly Republican in presidential contests. And while most members from such seats have been willing to accept the background check bills the party has advanced so far, the CNN analysis of support for Cicilline\u2019s bill shows that a ban on assault-style weapons remains a bridge too far for many of them. That picture becomes clear through a series of revealing contrasts. The assault ban legislation has drawn overwhelming support from Democrats representing districts that voted for Clinton in 2016. Leaving aside Pelosi, 193 of the 203 Democrats in such Clinton districts have endorsed the bill, some 95%. But Democrats in districts that voted for Trump last time are much more skittish. Of the 31 in such districts, just 16 have co-sponsored the bill, only about half. Although Democrats in districts that voted for Trump constitute about 13% of all House Democrats, the 15 of them not on Cicilline\u2019s bill constitute 60% of all the Democrats who haven\u2019t signed on. Similar patterns emerge in the CNN analysis on other political measures. Fully 194 of the 208 House Democrats who won in 2018 by more than five percentage points (again excluding Pelosi) have endorsed the bill. Those who won by less than five points split much more closely: 15 are on the bill, 11 are not. Demography is revealing too. Support for the ban is overwhelming in the Democrats\u2019 new sweet spot: urban and suburban districts with large numbers of college graduates and/or racial minorities. Again, leaving aside Pelosi, just eight of the 134 Democrats in districts where the share of college graduates exceeds the national average are not sponsoring the bill. That means only six% of them have not endorsed it. In the 100 Democratic districts with fewer college graduates than average, 17 legislators have not sponsored the bill; that\u2019s nearly three-times as large a share. Only 31 House Democrats still represent seats where the rural population exceeds one-fifth of the district\u2019s total. Eleven of them (more than one-third) have withheld support from the bill. Just 13 of the 194 Democrats (less than 7%) in seats with smaller rural populations have not endorsed the ban. (The rural share of the population isn\u2019t available for some districts.) The epicenter of resistance to the ban is the point where these lines converge. Of the 15 Democrats in Trump districts who have not endorsed the bill, 10 won by five percentage points or less (and another two won by less than ten points.) Ten of the Trump-district Democratic hold outs also represent seats with fewer college graduates than the national average. The ten Democratic hold outs from districts that Clinton won are an eclectic group. Only first-term Rep. Lizzie Fletcher in Houston among them won their own election by five points or less. But four of them \u2013 Sharice Davids in Kansas, Peter DeFazio and Kurt Schrader in Oregon, as well as Fletcher \u2013 hold seats that Clinton carried with well under 50% of the total vote. Perhaps most revealingly, seven of the ten hold seats with fewer college graduates than the national average. Four represent districts with relatively larger rural populations. Cicilline says that in talking to colleagues resisting the bill, particularly those from Trump districts, the principal concern about the assault ban is that it triggers a trip wire in the gun control debate. With the exception of the ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, the other gun control measures the Democratic House has considered so far regulate the kind of people who are allowed access to guns. But the assault-style ban limits the kind of gun that anyone is allowed to buy. \u201cThe biggest objection is unlike\u2026most of the other gun safety legislation which is really focused on how to do you keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them\u2026this prohibits the possession of a particular kind of weapon even by law-abiding citizens,\u201d Cicilline says. The growing discussion of a mandatory buyback of the assault weapons already in circulation, now popularized on the campaign trail by O\u2019Rourke, adds another complication to the Democratic calculations. Cicilline says such a provision \u201cabsolutely\u201d would sink the bill banning future purchases of assault style weapons. But Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), who touted the idea during his own now-ended bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, says he will seek a vote on such a mandatory buyback if the assault ban comes to the floor. \u201cMy message to my colleagues is if you want to ban this weapon because it\u2019s dangerous for the future, you have to acknowledge it is dangerous now,\u201d Swalwell said in an interview. \u201cLet\u2019s just do the buyback as well, recognizing that if [a voter] is opposed to the assault weapon ban, that voter is not going to be with us on anything. So, let\u2019s do what makes us the most safe.\u201d Even without a vote on a buyback of assault-style weapons-which most observers consider unlikely to reach the floor-the struggle over regulating these weapons offers a telling reality check with implications far beyond the gun debate. The deeper message of the House hesitation on Cicilline\u2019s bill is that even if Democrats hold the House, or tip the Senate, many of the proposals their class of 2020 presidential candidates are promoting across a wide range of issues face a much narrower legislative path than the ringing applause on the campaign trail would suggest.",

            "article_content": "A Florida man who authorities say has a history of expressing white supremacist beliefs was arrested for allegedly threatening a prospective candidate for city council in Charlottesville, Virginia, prompting the would-be candidate to abandon their campaign, an indictment unsealed Wednesday says. Daniel McMahon, 31, of Brandon, Florida, was arrested on federal charges for cyberstalking, bias-motivated interference with a candidate for elective office, willful interference with a candidate for elective office, and threats to injure in interstate commerce, according to the Justice Department. According to the unsealed indictment, which was returned by a federal grand jury in Virginia last week, McMahon expressed on social media his belief that whites are superior to other racial and religious groups. He also allegedly used social media accounts to \u201cthreaten and intimidate a potential candidate\u201d for the upcoming Charlottesville City Council election, the Justice Department said. McMahon allegedly threatened the candidate, who is described as African-American, because of their race and because they were campaigning for office. The threats caused the candidate to \u201cfear death and serious bodily injury,\u201d the indictment said. The indictment does not name the candidate, but identified them as \u201cD.G\u201d and refers to a January announcement about running for Charlottesville City Council, as well as the subsequent delay in entering the race. The initials appear to refer to Don Gathers, a local community activist and co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Charlottesville chapter. Gathers planned to announce in January that he would run for a seat on the Charlottesville City Council, only to abandon his plans a day later, the indictment says. The Daily Progress of Charlottesville reported at the time that Gathers cited health issues for his decision. Gathers has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CNN. McMahon\u2019s attorney Nicholas G. Matassini told CNN on Thursday that McMahon \u201cdenies acting with any racial animus and will enter a not guilty plea to all charges.\u201d David W. Archey, a special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Richmond Division, said McMahon\u2019s alleged actions \u201cwere an attempt to disrupt the American political process.\u201d \u201cThe FBI remains committed to protecting the civil liberties of all Americans,\u201d Archey said. \u201cWe are grateful for the assistance of the FBI office in Tampa and the partnership with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office during this investigation.\u201d The incident evokes memories of the racial violence that rocked the city two years ago. In August 2017, counterprotesters and white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other groups clashed over the city\u2019s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. James A. Fields Jr., who drove into a crowd of counterprotesters killing Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal, and injuring more than two dozen people, was sentenced to life in prison in June. CNN\u2019s David Shortell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump rarely deviates from his script \u2013 in this case, his backhanded appeals to racial minorities. On Monday evening, he commemorated Hispanic Heritage Month during a rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. \u201cHe happens to be Hispanic, but I\u2019ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do,\u201d the President said about Steve Cortes, a CNN contributor and Trump\u2019s brand of conservative. Trump continued: \u201cNobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics? He says the country. I don\u2019t know. I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote.\u201d What was on display at Monday\u2019s rally was the same kind of rhetorical sorcery the President is known for, this time in pursuit of an ambitious bid to upset New Mexico\u2019s decade-plus streak as a Democratic stronghold. How Trump speaks to black Americans says a lot about his vision for this country Consider his patronizing comments to the audience, wrapped in his queasy repetition of the word \u201clove.\u201d (Note, too, his insistence on using \u201cthe\u201d before \u201cHispanics.\u201d) He did something similar last week when delivering an address at the 2019 National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference. The President\u2019s specific approach to speaking with minority groups allows him to shower fustian praise without confronting his prominent history of racist statements and behavior. In addition, there was his instructive telegraphing about identity \u2013 specifically, about what he thinks it means to \u201clook Hispanic\u201d or register as \u201ca WASP.\u201d It\u2019s almost certain that no one would ever mistake Trump for a scholar of race and its innumerable complexities in American life. But it\u2019s still telling that even as he was addressing a crowd including many Hispanic supporters he couldn\u2019t piece together what the diversity around him revealed about his unsophisticated understanding of race. Also: the either-or dichotomy of, \u201cWho do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\u201d It\u2019s a line consistent with Trump\u2019s much larger tendency to frame Americanness for certain, typically nonwhite, non-\u201cWASP\u201d groups as something to be earned through partisan loyalty. Think of the President\u2019s remarks about former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Or about the progressive congressional \u201csquad.\u201d Or about American Jews. Or his \u201cmy African American\u201d remark. It might be tempting to say that Trump is taking a different political tack by pitching to Hispanic voters in a state he lost in the 2016 presidential election. But just under the surface, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the same fantasia of barely-there benevolence. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose.",

            "article_content": "An escalating cycle of action and reaction between President Donald Trump and the Democratic presidential contenders is thrusting issues of race relations and American identity to the center of the developing 2020 campaign. In office, Trump has appealed even more overtly than he did as a candidate in 2016 to the racial resentments of some white voters with such comments as his call for four House Democratic women of color to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from and his 2017 declaration that \u201cvery fine people\u201d had marched on both sides in Charlottesville, Virginia. In response partly to Trump, and partly to demands from the party base, the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are talking more explicitly than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 about \u201csystemic racism\u201d (Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg), \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d (Sen. Kamala Harris of California) and \u201cinstitutional segregation\u201d (former Vice President Joe Biden). At last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas echoed a recent New York Times project and declared that the introduction of slavery in 1619, not the Declaration of Independence in 1776, was the \u201cfoundational\u201d event in shaping America. \u201cRacism in America is endemic,\u201d O\u2019Rourke declared. \u201cIt is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will.\u201d Simultaneously, the eruption of new allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 and Trump\u2019s emphatic immediate defense of his nominee \u2013 is but one of several issues that are likely to highlight questions about the changing role of women in society. The cumulative effect could be to compound the dynamic evident in 2016, when an array of political science studies found that attitudes about racism and sexism predicted support for Trump or Clinton much more powerfully than people\u2019s assessments of their own economic situations. In 2016, the studies found, the more likely voters were to say that racism and sexism are no longer problems in American life, the more likely they were to vote for Trump. Recent surveys have likewise found that Trump runs far better among voters who believe that discrimination against minorities is not a major problem than those who do; Trump supporters are also far more likely than other Americans to maintain that discrimination against whites is a significant problem, the surveys have found. Attitudes toward these dynamics \u201cis something that has divided the parties for quite awhile,\u201d says Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts University who conducted some of the research about the impact of attitudes toward racial and gender discrimination in 2016. \u201cBut there\u2019s something Trump has added to this \u2026 Trump and his rhetoric just make these divisions more explicit.\u201d In 2020, the contrast between the nominees on issues of race relations will likely be as stark as any since the Republicans in 1964 nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater, who opposed the Civil Rights Act, against President Lyndon Johnson, who steered it into law. Trump has appealed to racial resentments more openly than any national figure in either party since George Wallace in the 1960s, while declaring that Democrats are the real racists for accusing him, and by implication his supporters, of racism. At the same time, the Democratic candidates are portraying America as infected with racism more openly and insistently than any previous party leaders, even Barack Obama, the first African American president. Many of the Democrats are explicitly calling Trump a racist and some have expressed sympathy for the concept of providing reparations to African Americans for the long-term impact of slavery. That means both parties are now framing the debate over America\u2019s changing identity in a manner that seems likely to elevate the role of these issues in sorting voters between the two sides. Schaffner thinks these divisions could grow more pronounced in 2020 whether Democrats nominate a woman or racial minority to face Trump, or pick a white man. If Democrats select a woman or racial minority, that candidate, like Clinton and Obama, will personify social change in a way likely to provoke the core Republican voters who are most uneasy about it, he notes. On the other hand, if Democrats nominate a white man, that candidate will likely feel pressure to respond to the party\u2019s increasingly diverse electoral coalition by talking more explicitly than past nominees about \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201csystemic\u201d racism. \u201cIf Democrats nominate a white male, that person on one hand might seem less threatening to moderate voters who maybe have somewhat conservative racial views,\u201d says Schaffner. \u201cOn the other hand, that candidate, given what the Democratic Party base looks like these days, is going to have to campaign somewhat more explicitly on issues that matter to minority groups.\u201d That dynamic was evident in the sort of charged language that O\u2019Rourke used at last week\u2019s Democratic debate about slavery\u2019s role in shaping American society. Major components of the Democratic coalition might consider such bracing talk long overdue, but it is also virtually certain to make \u201cracially conservative voters feel more resentful,\u201d notes Schaffner. The heightened pressure on the Democratic field is also evident in the fierce blowback from many liberal nonwhite writers and political activists to Biden\u2019s comments during last week\u2019s debate about sending social workers to help low-income parents raise their children (in part by using a \u201crecord player\u201d at night). In their substance (if not their tangled exposition and anachronistic references), Biden\u2019s arguments reflected standard-issue thinking among Bill Clinton-era \u201cNew Democrats\u201d about fusing calls for more \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d to programs designed to expand opportunity for low-income and minority families. But in today\u2019s more highly charged racial environment, Biden\u2019s call for such interventions drew charges from prominent minority writers of \u201cpaternalistic racism\u201d and \u201cone of the most explicitly racist moments of all time in a Democratic primary debate.\u201d Detailed studies of public opinion during the Trump era have almost universally concluded that there has not been significant change in the share of Americans who believe or dispute that discrimination against minorities and women is still a problem in American society. What\u2019s changed under Trump is that attitudes on those questions have become more important in shaping how Americans vote. In their 2018 book \u201cIdentity Crisis,\u201d for instance, political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck reported that multiple post-election surveys found that \u201cwhites\u2019 attitudes about race, ethnicity and religion came to play a larger role in 2016 than in other recent elections.\u201d Working with two colleagues, Schaffner likewise found that in 2016 the more likely voters were to believe that racial discrimination is not a systemic problem and that women complaining about sexism were actually seeking unfair advantage over men, the more likely they were to support Trump. That relationship was as powerful among women voters as among men, and for both groups those attitudes dwarfed voters\u2019 assessments of whether their personal economic situations were improving or deteriorating. In a follow-up paper this year, Schaffner found that attitudes about whether racism or sexism persists as a problem predicted support for Republican or Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 more powerfully than they did in 2016 or the previous midterm election, in 2014. The reason for that greater correlation was that some previously Republican-leaning voters who are more liberal on issues relating to racial and gender discrimination peeled away from the party to support Democratic candidates last year, he found. An array of recent public opinion surveys has found that a huge chasm persists between the Democratic and Republican coalitions on whether minorities still face discrimination in America. An August national Quinnipiac University survey found that voters who support Trump are much more likely than those who don\u2019t to believe that whites face significant discrimination in America today and African Americans and immigrants do not, according to detailed figures provided to me by the pollsters. In the Quinnipiac survey, fully 57% of voters who approved of Trump\u2019s job performance said that discrimination against whites was a very or somewhat serious problem today, according to those previously unpublished results. Only 34% of voters who disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance agreed. Conversely, while 94% of voters who disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance say discrimination against African Americans is a problem, just 41% of those who approve of him agree. The gap is similar for immigrants: While 95% of voters who disapprove of Trump say immigrants face discrimination, just 45% of Trump supporters agree. Put another way, more Trump supporters say whites face discrimination (57%) than say immigrants (48%) or African Americans (41%) do. A solid majority of Trump supporters say African Americans do not face serious discrimination (55%) and a plurality say the same about immigrants (48%). Among voters who don\u2019t approve of Trump, the pattern is inverted: Two-thirds of them say whites don\u2019t face discrimination, while only about 1 in 20 say the same about blacks or immigrants. These attitudes loom over preliminary vote choices for 2020, according to the Quinnipiac findings. In the survey, Trump held a 49% to 44% lead over Biden among the roughly two-fifths of voters who believe that discrimination against whites is a problem; Biden led Trump by 64% to 28% among the majority who said it is not. Conversely Trump held an 81% to 13% advantage among the quarter of the electorate who say discrimination against African Americans is not a problem, while Biden led by 70% to 22% among the nearly three-fourths who say it is. Attitudes about gender relations divide Trump supporters and opponents in similar patterns. An extensive recent study that pollster Tresa Undem conducted for the liberal women\u2019s activist group Supermajority found huge gaps between liberal and conservative women not only on political choices, such as whether abortion should remain legal, but on underlying social trends, such as whether women have achieved equal treatment in American society or whether women interpret too many remarks from men as sexist. Undem\u2019s findings reinforced the results of studies from Schaffner and his colleagues, as well as those by Erin Cassese of the University of Delaware and Tiffany Barnes of the University of Kentucky, which found that female voters who supported Trump in 2016 were far less likely than those who backed Clinton to believe that women face discrimination and far more likely to believe children are better off if their mothers stay at home and that families succeed when men work and women raise the children. For many Trump supporters, \u201cthey don\u2019t see a problem\u201d with how women or minorities are treated, says Undem, whose firm polls mostly for nonprofit organizations and liberal advocacy groups. \u201cThen, they are supersensitive to being called racist and sexist,\u201d she continues. \u201cI just get the sense they have fused their own identity \u2026 in Trump, so to attack Trump is to attack them. (They are saying,) \u2018No, I\u2019m not a racist, and there\u2019s no racism.\u2019 \u201c Many polls this summer have found that a majority of Americans believe that Trump is racially insensitive and disrespectful; in the harshest possible phrasing, Quinnipiac found in July that a 51% majority of Americans consider Trump a \u201cracist.\u201d But private polling conducted in recent weeks by the firm GQR for a consortium of liberal groups has stirred debate in Democratic circles by concluding that the party nonetheless is unlikely to benefit among voters by directly labeling Trump a racist. That was partly because right-leaning voters consider the phrase too loosely applied to any conservative and partly because some swing voters recoil from the level of personal acrimony inherent in the charge. Anna Greenberg, the Democratic pollster who conducted that research, says Democrats could find sturdier ground by accusing Trump of using race to divide the country \u2013 rather than personally harboring racist beliefs \u2013 and by talking about structural racial inequities. \u201cA wonky conversation about institutional racism and solutions to it I don\u2019t think is threatening to most people,\u201d she says. The tripwire for Democrats among some white voters, she believes, is when they frame policies to expand opportunities for minorities as a kind of penance for whites. \u201cThe difference is if you are saying, \u2018This is your fault and you must pay the price of your ancestors,\u2019 that\u2019s when I think you start getting in a little bit of trouble with voters.\u201d Navigating that line isn\u2019t likely to be easy for the eventual Democratic nominee. That\u2019s especially true because Trump routinely portrays any criticism of his behavior as an attempt to brand his preponderantly white supporters as racist. From the other direction, as the fierce blowback against Biden\u2019s \u201crecord player\u201d comments signal, Democrats face more pressure than ever to explicitly denounce racism and to portray it as the predominant force shaping life in America for minority groups, even if that formulation antagonizes some white voters. Those dynamics are two trains, gathering speed, on track for a head-on collision before November 2020.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden was as good at Thursday night\u2019s debate as he\u2019s been in the entire campaign and perhaps close to as good as he could be. In some scenarios of how the 2020 election breaks, such a solid but unspectacular showing could be enough for the former vice president to win the Democratic nomination and maybe even the White House. After a summer marked by occasional gaffes suggested he might be a decade past his best, Biden personified one of his most winning characteristics \u2013 resilience \u2013 in steadying his front-running campaign. His performance in Houston is likely to quell fears that his third presidential bid could stall at any minute like his previous campaigns and leave questions about his deepest liabilities for another day. It keeps his core claim intact that he is the most electable Democrat in a fierce race with President Donald Trump It helped that one of his rivals, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro defused the age question with a crude suggestion that Biden had memory problems that even appeared to make other candidates on stage blanch. And since the night lacked a standout showing by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been rising in the polls and media buzz, or anyone else on stage, the debate may therefore freeze the race in place with Biden as a clear but not prohibitive front-runner. After appearing off his game in previous debates, Biden was sharper, traded jabs more easily with other candidates, and was stronger on policy \u2013 his own and the weaknesses in the platforms of his foes for the nomination \u2013 than ever before. He made his strongest tilt yet at animating a center left argument for Democrats \u2013 one that puts him at odds with the noisiest and most progressive elements of his party. And he began to tease out the ideological debate with Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that could define this race. His message was that big aspirations on issues like health care are great \u2013 but ultimately mean nothing without a plan to get them enacted in what is likely to be an unresponsive Congress. But Biden was far from perfect. In one almost impossible-to-follow interaction, he came across as rambling and out of touch when he was asked about his past attitudes to historic racial discrimination. He appeared to suggest that some African-Americans are poor parents, made a reference to technology that has been obsolete for years and then made an odd diversion to speak about Venezuela. \u201cWe bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not want they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2013 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2013 the \u2013 make sure that kids hear words.\u201d Castro, who was up next up, quipped: \u201cThank you very much.  Well \u2026 that\u2019s quite a lot.\u201d Biden was unable to make an overarching argument for why Trump should be blocked from a second White House term. That\u2019s odd since his entire campaign is premised on the idea that the President is an assault on basic American values. It was left to California Sen. Kamala Harris to pick up that theme and Biden might regret giving her an opening. While he was more nimble on his feet, Biden still sometimes began a sentence as if he often didn\u2019t know where it ended. Occasionally, he inadvertently stressed his age \u2013 one of his campaign\u2019s biggest challenges given the taxing nature of the presidency and the potency of the youth vote in his party. For instance he opened the debate talking about President John Kennedy\u2019s moonshot. JFK is a legend for Democrats \u2013 but also a figure from the mists of time for young activists who unlike Biden did not come of age in the era of Camelot. Biden\u2019s explanation of his original support for the Iraq war was meanwhile confusing and mixed in a meandering argument about Afghanistan. Foreign policy is supposed to be his strength. And Biden\u2019s repeated invoking of the presidency of Barack Obama \u2013 who has become a talismanic figure in his party \u2013 is beginning to look more like a crutch than a strong political point. Biden is no longer the wisecracking, vibrant politician that he was in the 2008 Democratic race, where he was a sparkling debater who fell at the first hurdle in Iowa. The years since have been grueling for him, politically and especially personally. But he is still there, unbowed and decent, and that may be an asset in a bitter political era when such qualities seem quaint. Biden, Sanders and Warren clash over health care Much of the 2020 campaign is beyond Biden\u2019s control, so all he can do is put forward the best version of himself. If Democrats decide that they want a progressive icon who inspires the liberal base and promises to ignite a social revolution that remakes the face of politics \u2013 he has no chance. In that case, Warren or even Sanders have an opening. If a charismatic candidate currently in the second tier like Harris or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker suddenly catches fire, the former vice president could be left flat-footed. But if Democrats reason that the country needs a return to a more traditional politics, a period of peace and presidential dignity after the daily eruptions from Trump\u2019s White House and a moderate \u2013 then it might be his time. Given that equation, Biden must prove he can both make the center left case crisply on stage and that he can parry attacks from rivals who are far less vicious than the President. On balance, that was what Biden did on Thursday. While accepting a need for big reform on issues like health care \u2013 Biden was mindful of general election voters and moderate Democrats who balk at the radicalism of some of his rivals. And the former vice president was able to profit from some clumsy attacks from other candidates. Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration, made a poorly received jab at Biden\u2019s age, when he snapped : \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d The attack \u2013 a move by a candidate desperate for traction in the race \u2013 is likely to go down poorly among Democrats for whom Biden is a much loved and respected figure. It also committed the sin of mirroring one of Trump\u2019s on the 76-year-old Democratic veteran. Sanders stung Biden into a passionate rejoinder and gave him a political opening when he said his health plan was the only one that could ensure someone who got cancer would not go bankrupt. \u201cI know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something. It\u2019s personal to me,\u201d said Biden who lost his beloved adult son Beau to the disease in the latest of a string of family tragedies. It helped Biden that Warren had a quiet night \u2013 so his main foil in the progressive vs. moderate contest was Sanders, whose voice, apparently affected by a cold, sounded more abrasive than normal. One of Biden\u2019s most touching qualities and one of his most powerful political skills is connecting with voters through the prism of his own life of grief and loss. He invoked the death of his first wife and daughter in a car crash and Beau\u2019s passing in his final answer about how he would show residence as president. \u201cFor me, the way I\u2019ve dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I\u2019ve always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another, without the help I had,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are real heroes out there. Some real heroes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris of California said that if she\u2019s elected president, she will back abolishing the filibuster if Senate Republicans stand in the way of legislation to combat climate change. It\u2019s the first time she has said as a 2020 candidate that she supports the end of the filibuster \u2013 the requirement that any legislation get 60 votes to end the Senate\u2019s unlimited debate and bring it to a simple majority vote. During Wednesday\u2019s CNN climate crisis town hall, Harris slammed a Senate committee hearing \u201cduring which the underlying premise of the hearing was to debate whether science should be the basis of public policy,\u201d eliciting murmurs from the crowd. Harris said she would first seek to work with the GOP. However, she said, \u201cif they fail to act, as president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal.\u201d Harris\u2019 call for a filibuster comes on the heels of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell bluntly warning Democrats last month against weakening the procedure. \u201cThe legislative filibuster is directly downstream from our founding tradition. If that tradition frustrates the whims of those on the far left, it is their half-baked proposals and not the centuries-old wisdom that need retooling,\u201d the Kentucky Republican wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times. The filibuster is a concrete obstacle in Democrats\u2019 path, as they would need to win the presidency and gain three seats in the Senate to take control of the chamber in the 2020 elections. But the party would need 60 votes \u2013 virtually an impossibility given the map of Senate seats up for election next year \u2013 to win a filibuster-proof majority. That means even if a Democrat is elected president and the party wins full control of Congress, Republicans would still have the ability to block legislation in the Senate unless the filibuster is done away with. Fellow candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made a similar call to end the filibuster in April, calling the procedure \u201ca tool to block progress on racial justice,\u201d according to excerpts of her speech. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As football season heats up, the New England Patriots are increasingly unlikely to celebrate their Super Bowl victory with one of their biggest fans \u2013 President Donald Trump. According to the New York Times, time is running out for the NFL team to make a customary visit to the White House following their February win. Due to a rigorous preseason practice schedule, the delay in a visit to the nation\u2019s capital has made it all but certain the team would not be breaking bread with the commander in chief. The two sides told the New York Times that they were unable to come to an agreement over a date that works for both the team and Trump. Both sides say it has nothing to do with politics. \u201cWe would welcome them to the White House in the future should a future date work out,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN on Sunday. Three Patriots players, though, have already said in interviews with the New York Times that they are not interested in attending a ceremony at the White House, one even suggesting he would rather meet with former President Barack Obama. The friendly relationship between the Patriots and the President has been well-documented, but at times has been bogged down by controversy. Robert Kraft, the team\u2019s owner who has been close friends with Trump for decades, was charged in February with soliciting sex acts at a massage parlor. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. Despite their friendship, Kraft has privately said that he doesn\u2019t feel that Trump\u2019s mission \u201cis in the best interests of America\u201d after Trump slammed players for kneeling during the National Anthem. In July, Trump and Kraft sat one chair away from one another at a dinner at the Treasury Department. In March, according to the New York Times, Trump reportedly told aides that he still wanted Kraft to attend a ceremony at the White House despite the charges against him. \u201cHe\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally,\u201d Trump said of Kraft in February. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also said he considers himself a friend of the President, saying Trump has been \u201csupportive\u201d and they sometimes speak on the phone. Before Trump won the Republican nomination in 2015, Brady kept a Make America Great Again hat in his locker and said it would be \u201cgreat\u201d if Trump won the election, but later said he did not mean to endorse Trump for President. The President has, over the years, sung the praises of Brady, and said he was \u201ctotally innocent\u201d after the \u201cdeflategate\u201d scandal in 2016. The day before the election, Trump announced to a rally that Brady had told him he had voted for him. Brady later said he had not voted yet.  Brady did not attend the 2017 Super Bowl ceremony at the White House, and he said he was spending time with his sick mother. Bill Belichick, who has ushered the team through six Super Bowl wins as head coach, wrote a letter to Trump days before the 2016 election, which Trump read on stage at a rally. When Trump invited the team after their 2017 Super Bowl win, at least two dozen players skipped the event, according to the New York Times. At the time, a Patriots spokesperson told the New York Times that the team\u2019s frequent Super Bowl wins could have affected turnout negatively, because White House visits could begin to feel less special. The Patriots have visited the White House five times after Super Bowl victories. All of their visits have been in April or May, according to the Times. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a sports team didn\u2019t attend a ceremony despite an official invitation from Trump. Last year, Trump ultimately disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles from celebrating their win at the White House after players and coaches boycotted the visit over Trump\u2019s displeasure of players kneeling during the National Anthem. Earlier this year, the University of Virginia basketball team declined to celebrate their victory at the White House, also citing logistical concerns. The 2018 NBA champion Golden State Warriors spent time with former President Barack Obama during their trip to Washington instead of a White House visit this year. In September 2017, several months after the team won the 2017 NBA championship, Trump rescinded his invitation to the team to visit the White House in honor of their win. The decision came after Stephen Curry, the team\u2019s superstar player, publicly criticized Trump\u2019s attacks on black athletes protesting police brutality during the National Anthem. In January, Trump celebrated the victory of the Clemson University football team, providing a feast of various fast food to the players during the government shutdown. And in April, Trump for the first time welcomed a women\u2019s sports team to the White House for their own event: the 2019 NCAA women\u2019s tournament champion Baylor Bears. The Boston Red Sox visited the White House in May to celebrate their national championship and the team\u2019s attendance broke down along racial and ethnic lines.",

            "article_content": "Conservative radio host and former Illinois US Rep. Joe Walsh will challenge President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2020, he announced Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m going to run for president,\u201d Walsh said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d also telling host George Stephanopoulos, \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever I can. I don\u2019t want him (Trump) to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I\u2019m not successful, I\u2019m not voting for him.\u201d Walsh had said Thursday that he was \u201cstrongly, strongly considering\u201d entering the race. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be cute or coy. I\u2019ve told you before \u2013 if somebody\u2019s going to get in there and go after him \u2026 it\u2019s got to be done soon,\u201d Walsh told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re running out of time. But more importantly, these are not conventional times. Look at the guy in the White House. These are urgent times.\u201d On Sunday, Walsh called Trump \u201cnuts,\u201d \u201cerratic,\u201d \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cincompetent.\u201d Walsh, who was elected to Congress with support from the Tea Party movement, has a history of making controversial comments, including some about former President Barack Obama. In 2016, he accused Obama of hating Israel and pushed the false conspiracy theory that Obama is Muslim. He was\u00a0also accused that year of inciting violence\u00a0against Obama in the wake of a\u00a0deadly sniper attack on Dallas police. A few years earlier, in a\u00a02011 interview, he suggested that Obama was only elected because he was \u201ca black man who was articulate.\u201d Walsh was\u00a0also once kicked off air for using racial slurs\u00a0when discussing the Washington Redskins NFL team. He said he voted for Trump in 2016, but only because Trump wasn\u2019t Hillary Clinton. Where Trump lost him, Walsh said, was during the President\u2019s news conference with Vladimir Putin at their summit last year in Helsinki, Finland, at which Trump sided with the Russian strongman over his own intelligence community\u2019s assessments of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. In 2016, the former Illinois congressman said if Clinton was elected president, \u201cI\u2019m grabbing my musket,\u201d and he called on others to do the same. He later insisted to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that his comments were not an incitement to armed revolution. Walsh told Tapper he\u2019s used the phrase \u201cgrab your musket\u201d multiple times over the past several years but never meant Trump supporters should literally reach for their firearms. Walsh was featured in a Showtime series in which \u201cBorat\u201d comedian Sacha Baron Cohen wore disguises to prank prominent figures like former Vice President Dick Cheney and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. In a preview of the series \u201cWho Is America?\u201d Walsh was recorded seemingly advocating for arming children. Walsh later defended himself to CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish and said he was reading off of a teleprompter, and didn\u2019t know at the time \u201cthe whole thing was made up.\u201d He said Cohen is a \u201cfunny guy because he gets people to say stupid things. He gets people to say stupid things because he lies to them.\u201d Walsh had previously called for a Republican to challenge the President, and earlier this month called Trump an \u201cunfit con man\u201d who is \u201cbad for the country.\u201d But Walsh isn\u2019t the only conservative candidate looking to take on Trump. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced in April that he would challenge Trump, telling Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d that it would be a \u201cpolitical tragedy\u201d and he would \u201cfear for the republic\u201d if the country had Trump as President for a second term. Former Rep. Mark Sanford told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on \u201cCNN Right Now\u201d in July that he is considering mounting a challenge to Trump in 2020, with plans this month to explore a possible candidacy. The South Carolina Republican has planned visits to key early-voting states New Hampshire and Iowa. Any of the three possible Republican contenders, though, would be a long shot against the President, who, according to Gallup, has an 88% approval rating among Republican voters.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is not waiting for the economy to go south amid growing fears of a recession to wage what could be the defining fight of the 2020 election. Trump is becoming increasingly nervous that the end of an 11-year expansion could scupper his hopes of a second term and is going on the attack as ill omens and recent stock market slumps haunt the global economy. \u201cMost economists actually say we are not going to have a recession,\u201d Trump told reporters in New Jersey on Sunday. \u201cMost of them are saying we will not have a recession but the rest of the world is not doing well like we are doing.\u201d Trump downplays talk of a recession after his economic advisers say growing fears are unfounded A recession does not appear to be an immediate danger in the US but signs of a global slowdown are sprouting up everywhere, hinting that Trump could face a more difficult political environment in 2020 than expected. A successful reelection race in the face of a sluggish economy would represent the biggest sales job of the former real estate mogul\u2019s life and he would again rewrite the laws of political gravity. As he begins a bid to define the economy and hedge against a recession, Trump is testing a searing, materialistic message to voters who might spurn him if tougher times arrive. And the President, who dispatched his top economic advisers to Sunday talk shows, is also dishing out a mixture of accurate and misleading commentary and blaming the Federal Reserve and the media in case there is trouble ahead. \u201cOur economy is the best in the world, by far,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter as thoughts of the economy played on his mind during a summer Sunday afternoon at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. \u201cLowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!\u201d Trump tweeted. The President knows that a recession in the run-up to an election can spell disaster for incumbents. For example, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush could partly blame reelection losses on poor economic performance at the wrong moment. The facts behind Trump's push for the Fed to cut rates The economy may be more important for Trump than it is for other presidents given that its current health is one of the few policy areas where polls show he has majority support. It\u2019s also therefore ironic that some of Trump\u2019s own policies \u2014 for instance his tariff war with China \u2014 are raising investor fears of a recession that could doom him politically. Uncertainty about the economy is fomented partly from conflicting signs. Jobs growth remains strong in the US and consumer spending is robust, according to the latest data. But the slowest growth in China in three decades, imminent recession fears in big European economies and bearish signals sent last week by the bond markets could be early warning signs of a 2020 economic headache for Trump. Buttigieg: Trump administration's China tariffs 'a fool's errand' \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, are we headed for a recession? That\u2019s not my base case scenario,\u201d Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on Friday. \u201cBut the risks have increased quite a bit.\u201d If a recession does materialize to threaten Trump\u2019s reelection hopes, he can be expected to dial up the toxicity of a campaign in which he has already used the most strident racial rhetoric and demagoguery seen in top level politics in generations. A recession would also transform the Democratic White House race. So far, candidates have mainly argued that the wealth created in the Trump economy has not been fairly shared and have been vulnerable to the facts of the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and broad public satisfaction with the economy. But they are also now seizing on signs that Trump\u2019s worsening trade war with China is hammering global sentiment. Five of the world's biggest economies are at risk. Here's where the US stands \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 a fool\u2019s errand to think you\u2019ll be able to get China to change the fundamentals of their economic model by poking them in the eye with tariffs,\u201d Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg said Sunday in an exclusive interview with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s some basic facts you can\u2019t escape, one of them is that American farmers are getting killed,\u201d said Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. If the economy does stumble, Democrats would be certain to quickly pivot to a full-on attack on Republican economic management \u2014 including high deficits and the GOP tax reform bill \u2013 whatever Trump\u2019s record of the past few years. Fresh polling is revealing Trump\u2019s political risk factors and is beginning to suggest stirrings of public disquiet with how he is handling economic issues \u2013 one of the few policy areas where he has enjoyed majority voter confidence. Farmers are staring down Trump's trade war. WH trade adviser defends President's strategy A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed Americans still back Trump\u2019s economic management by 49% to 46%. But it contained a warning sign for the White House since his rating on the question slipped from a 51% to 41% split in May. Trump\u2019s general approval rating in the poll was at 43%, suggesting that there is a significant minority of Americans who still like the Trump economy \u2013 even if they don\u2019t like him. If he can\u2019t persuade those voters to swallow their broader doubts and back him in November 2020, his narrow path to reelection could disappear altogether. So it\u2019s not surprising that CNN and other media organizations last week cited sources as saying that Trump is more and more worried about the economy after a week of grim forecasts. Trump also spoke to the CEOs of big banks to ask their assessments of the economy last week and was told that his tariffs were making the situation worse, CNBC reported. In what was widely seen as a first acknowledgment that his test of wills with China is harming Americans, Trump also delayed the imposition of billions of dollars in new tariffs to protect consumers during the crucial Christmas holiday shopping period. The President also rolled out a tough new appeal at a campaign rally last week, saying even voters who didn\u2019t like him should stick with him for their own financial well being. Trump tells crowd it has 'no choice' but to vote for him over economy \u201cYou have no choice but to vote for me, because (if) your 401(k)\u2019s down the tubes, everything\u2019s gonna be down the tubes,\u201d Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Thursday. \u201cSo whether you love me or hate me, you gotta vote for me.\u201d Earlier, Trump had told reporters that economic growth would end if he is turfed out of the White House after four years. \u201cThe fact that I won lifted our economy greatly.\u00a0And if I didn\u2019t win, it would go down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd, frankly, if, for some reason that happened in the 2020 election, you\u2019ll see this economy go down the tubes.\u00a0I will tell you that right now.\u201d Trump\u2019s top economic advisers sent a coordinated signal of brash optimism about the economy on Sunday, perhaps intended just as much for a fretful President as outside consumption. Aides got Trump to delay tariffs by telling President it could 'ruin Christmas' \u201cNo, I don\u2019t see a recession. And let me add just one theme \u2026 Just one theme. We\u2019re doing pretty darn well, in my judgment. Let\u2019s not be afraid of optimism,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the White House\u2019s chief economic adviser, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s top White House trade adviser denied the trade war was hurting Americans, said it was seriously damaging China, and called the Trump economy \u201cthe best game on the globe.\u201d Speaking to Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Navarro also accused the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell of \u201csuppressing\u201d investment and exports. \u201cThe Federal Reserve Chairman should look in the mirror and say \u2018I raised rates too far, too fast and I cost this economy a full percentage point of growth,\u2019\u201d Navarro said.",

Bernie Sanders unveiled Sunday a criminal justice overhaul to \u201creform every aspect of America\u2019s dysfunctional criminal justice system\u201d by ending \u201cfor-profit greed\u201d in the system, expanding inmates\u2019 rights and changing how policing works in the country. According to the plan, if elected president, Sanders \u2013 who has long campaigned on ending for-profit prisons \u2013 would ban cash bail and civil asset forfeiture, as well as increase the number of public defenders and funding for them to better serve certain communities, according to the plan. He would also enact a \u201cPrisoner Bill of Rights\u201d for incarcerated people that includes rights to living wages and educational training, as well as the right to vote. Sanders proposes his latest plan amid an election cycle in which the country\u2019s criminal justice system and mass incarceration are critical issues for candidates and voters, particularly people of color. The comprehensive plan, which was rolled out on the same day that Sanders made several campaign stops in Columbia, South Carolina, could provide fodder for the Vermont independent as he looks to court African-American voters in battleground states and elsewhere. At a town hall on Sunday, the candidate billed the plan as \u201cperhaps the boldest criminal justice reform package in the history of United States politics.\u201d Biden unveils criminal justice plan ahead of debate showdown with Harris, Booker As part of his proposed criminal justice overhaul, Sanders aims to change the way policing works by \u201ccreating an unarmed civilian corp of first responders\u201d that would respond to \u201clow-level\u201d issues like homelessness and mental health emergencies. He would also work to reduce the number of incidents of excessive police force by creating national standards for police that \u201cemphasize de-escalation rather than violence.\u201d Additionally, Sanders would work to abolish the death penalty and solitary confinement, raise the age to charge children in adult courts to 18, legalize marijuana and \u201c(expunge) past convictions for marijuana-related offenses.\u201d Sanders, according to the plan, would also set \u201ca goal of cutting the incarcerated population in half.\u201d Several other candidates have detailed how they would change aspects of the criminal justice system, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who in July proposed a $20 billion grant program aimed at pressuring states to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes. Last month, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, released his racial justice plan that, among other things, would seek to reduce incarceration by 50% at the state and federal level and abolish private federal prisons.

            "article_content": "Everything, as always with Donald Trump, is about what\u2019s good for the President. In a fresh example of this core truth defining the current administration, Israel caved Thursday to his demands to ban two Muslim US lawmakers who Trump is ostracizing as part of his 2020 reelection strategy. There is no sign that Trump considered whether his latest targeting of Reps. Ilhan Omar or Rashida Tlaib conflicts with US foreign policy goals, reflects American values, benefits Israel in the long-term or is in keeping with the principles of two rigorous democracies that pride themselves on debate among ideological foes. The latest manifestation of the Trump first foreign policy was instead another sign that national interest is often subordinate to this President\u2019s immediate political requirements. In a characteristic but still shocking shattering of norms, the President of the United States actively lobbied a foreign government to refuse admission to two of his compatriots. Israel bars Democratic congresswomen from entering country Trump\u2019s celebration of his success underscored how he plans to ignore any presidential guardrail in waging the cultural warfare on which he is relying to secure a second White House term. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve said about Israel and Jewish people is a horrible thing, and they\u2019ve become the face of the Democrat Party,\u201d Trump said, hours after Israel announced its decision. Trump habitually shows few qualms in using the powers of the presidency, which are especially broad in foreign policy, for his own personal ends. His denial of Russian election meddling and crush on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for example both arguably promote his image and ego over orthodox US global strategies. But his power play against Israel was unapologetically partisan, even for Trump. Amid a raging political controversy in Washington and Israel, authorities later granted permission for Tlaib to enter the country on humanitarian grounds to visit her family in the West Bank. \u201cCongresswoman Tlaib has sent tonight a letter to Minister Deri in which she committed to accept all the demands of Israel to respect the restrictions imposed on her in the visit, and she also promised not to advance boycotts against Israel during her visit,\u201d Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said in a statement. AIPAC splits with Trump and Netanyahu, backs visit by Omar and Tlaib to Israel Many in Washington find the views of Omar and Tlaib toward Israel abhorrent. Omar was forced to apologize earlier this year after she suggested that support for the Jewish state in Congress was motivated by campaign contributions in remarks widely decried as anti-Semitic. But there is widespread bipartisan concern about how the new travel ban could impact Israel\u2019s political standing in the Congress where support for the Jewish state has been sweeping and bipartisan. Even the pro-Israel US lobby group AIPAC, usually in lockstep with Trump and which has criticized the two lawmakers over their rhetoric, expressed disquiet, despite making clear it disagreed with the views of Omar and Tlaib. \u201cWe \u2026 believe every member of Congress should be able to visit and experience our democratic ally Israel firsthand,\u201d AIPAC tweeted. The President\u2019s tweets also put Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a tough spot. Trump\u2019s public pressure on the Prime Minister risked leaving a leader, not usually seen as weak looking, put upon at a perilous moment \u2013 with a new election approaching that could end his long stranglehold on power in Israel. None of that is likely to matter for Trump, since he pocketed a shrewdly engineered political win that helped distract from growing talk of a possible recession that could cast a cloud over his reelection hopes. The President can now savor his success in returning Tlaib and Omar, who he wants to elevate as the extreme, anti-Semitic face of the Democratic Party back to the 2020 political spotlight. He got to burnish pro-Israel credentials popular with his base \u2013 especially evangelical voters who were earlier delighted with his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. And it all happened hours before his latest reelection rally in New Hampshire. Perhaps most pleasing for the President was the chance to jam Democratic leaders, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, into defending key members of the so-called \u201csquad\u201d as when he stirred a racial furor by telling the four American lawmakers to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. \u201cThe President\u2019s statements about the congresswomen are a sign of ignorance and disrespect, and beneath the dignity of the Office of the President,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. The fact that Trump\u2019s hardball tactics sparked outrage among the diplomatic establishment and condemnation to the media was a clear added bonus from a day\u2019s work on Twitter for Trump. Omar and Tlaib call Israel blocking their entry 'chilling' and 'a sign of weakness' Sovereign nations have every right to bar entry from critics that they believe do not share their values. And presidents have long considered their own political interests in dealing with Israel and treacherous Middle East politics. Advancing foreign policy goals has also long been a tool in reelection races \u2013 from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon to George H.W. Bush. But most presidents also seek to avoid the impression that they are acting purely for their own personal advantage. Often, their actions in the national interest risk prejudicing their own personal, political standing though in the end, serve to bolster their White House legacies. The 45th President is cut from different cloth. \u201cNever has there been a President in my experience who has so subsumed the American national interest not just to his political interests but to his own personality sensibilities and in some respects his own vanity and ego,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a Middle East peace negotiator for Democratic and GOP presidents, told CNN\u2019s Bianca Nobilo. Some Republicans worry that all this could backfire and hand Omar and Tlaib a political reward for their outspoken criticism of Israel and their support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement. \u201cDenying them entry into #Israel is a mistake. Being blocked is what they really hoped for all along in order to bolster their attacks against the Jewish state,\u201d Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted. The role of Washington\u2019s ambassador to Israel is also causing controversy. In a statement on Thursday, the envoy, David Friedman backed Israel\u2019s decision. But California Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu called on him to resign. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to understand that his allegiance is to America not a foreign power. He should be defending the rights of Americans to travel to other countries,\u201d Lieu told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Lieu later tweeted a similar sentiment, but then deleted it because of criticisms that he was raising a dual loyalty allegation, an anti-Semitic trope. Trump\u2019s intervention will also have political implications inside Israel, some of which could rebound against Netanyahu. Only a week ago, Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer said that his country would not deny entry to two members of the Congress. That the government that he serves has now climbed down could leave Netanyahu looking like a supplicant of Trump who has outsourced Israeli sovereignty to a foreign leader. Like other world leaders before him, Netanyahu has also learned that support from Trump must be repaid \u2013 in terms and at a time most favorable to the President\u2019s political goals. Netanyahu has relentlessly promoted his relationship with Trump, including in the previous Israeli election earlier this year. But his US critics have long worried that his interventions in US politics \u2013 against former President Barack Obama and in favor of Trump \u2013 risk weakening bipartisan support for Israel and could therefore in the long term threaten its security. \u201cDenying entry to members of the United States Congress is a sign of weakness, not strength. It will only hurt the US-Israeli relationship and support for Israel in America,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. At some point, Netanyahu, or a future Israeli leader, will find themselves dealing with a Democratic president. The diplomatic fallout from Thursday\u2019s events will be in the background when those meetings occur.",

            "article_content": "The fast-growing metropolitan areas of Texas are moving to the front line of the battle between the two major political parties for control of the nation\u2019s direction. Texas has been a linchpin of the Republican Party\u2019s national strength for a generation. But in 2018, Democrats recorded their most significant gains in decades in the state\u2019s largest urban centers. Now Texas Republicans face indications that the same recoil from President Donald Trump that has hurt the party in other diverse and well-educated metropolitan areas \u2013 from suburban Philadelphia to Orange County, California \u2013 could combine with growing racial diversity to move Texas from reliably red into a genuinely competitive state much more quickly than almost any analyst envisioned even a few years ago. \u201cTrump has sped everything up by four to six years,\u201d says Richard Murray, a University of Houston political scientist. For the Republicans, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a deadly combination of rapid demographic change and the immediate political dynamics.\u201d Texas remains a difficult, though not unreachable, target for Democrats in the 2020 presidential race \u2013 in part because it\u2019s unclear whether any potential Democratic nominee other than Beto O\u2019Rourke, who represented a House district in El Paso, would invest the massive sums required to truly compete in the state. But the party\u2019s improving position in Texas\u2019 thriving metropolitan areas is creating the opportunity for it to seriously contest as many as five or six more seats in the US House, possibly recapture enough seats to regain a majority in the state House of Representatives and mount highly competitive races both against Trump and Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is seeking reelection next year. Republicans keenly recognize the risk they will face if the Democrats can consolidate or even expand their recent beachheads in the state\u2019s metropolitan areas, particularly because those areas are projected to cast an ever-increasing share of the state\u2019s vote. \u201cWe had made the mistake for years of allowing Democrats to build up a set of strongholds in the major metro areas that they were then able to work from,\u201d says James Dickey, the Texas Republican Party chairman. \u201cSo it\u2019s incumbent on us to recover those gains and attack them right in the base of those strongholds.\u201d The battle for the allegiance of metropolitan Texas is likely to be one of the pivot points in American politics over the next decade. Republicans have carried Texas in every presidential race since 1976, and with the help of favorable district lines drawn by the GOP-controlled state Legislature, have been able to count on big margins from its state congressional delegation \u2013 where Republicans now hold 23 of the 36 seats \u2013 as well as its two Senate seats. It would fundamentally reshape the competition between the parties if Democrats can loosen the Republican grip on any of those prizes in Texas, especially its 38 Electoral College votes. And if Republicans can no longer count reliably on Texas \u2013 or other Sun  Belt states, including Arizona and Georgia, also being transformed by the same twin forces of urbanization and diversification \u2013 it would represent a huge price for the Trump strategy of maximizing support among rural and working-class white voters that has strengthened the GOP in Rust Belt battlegrounds such as Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. The key to Texas\u2019 political future is whether it finally follows the geographic realignment that has transformed the politics of many other states over the past quarter century. Across the country, Republicans since the 1980s have demonstrated increasing strength among voters who live in exurbs at the edge of the nation\u2019s metropolitan centers or beyond them entirely in small-town and rural communities. Democrats, in turn, have extended their historic dominance of the nation\u2019s urban cores into improved performance in inner suburbs, many of them well educated and racially diverse. Both sides of this dynamic have accelerated under Trump, whose open appeals to voters uneasy about racial, cultural and economic change have swelled GOP margins outside the metropolitan areas while alienating many traditionally center-right suburban voters. In Texas, only half of this equation has played out. In presidential elections since 2000, Republicans have consistently won more than two-thirds of the vote for the two parties in 199 mostly white nonmetropolitan counties across the state, according to a study by Murray and Renee Cross, senior director of the University of Houston\u2019s Hobby School of Public Affairs. (Trump in 2016 swelled that number to three-fourths.) The GOP has attracted dominant majorities from those areas in other races, from the Senate and US House to the governorship and state legislative contests. Democrats consistently amassed big majorities in 28 mostly Latino South Texas counties, but they have composed only a very small share of the statewide vote. The key to the GOP\u2019s dominance of the state is that through most of this century it has also commanded majorities in the 27 counties that make up the state\u2019s four biggest metropolitan areas: Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. Demographically similar places in states along the coasts and in the upper Midwest have moved consistently toward the Democrats since Bill Clinton\u2019s era. But in Texas, Republicans still carried 53% to 59% of the vote in those metropolitan counties in the four presidential races from 2000 through 2012, Murray and Cross found. In the Trump era, though, that metro strength has wavered for the GOP. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Trump across the 27 counties in Texas\u2019 four major metropolitan areas. Then in 2018, Democrat O\u2019Rourke carried over 54% of the vote in them in his narrow loss to Sen. Ted Cruz, Murray and Cross found. O\u2019Rourke won each of the largest metro areas, the first time any Democrat on the top of the ticket had carried all four since native son Lyndon B. Johnson routed Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential race, according to Murray and Cross. Looking just at the state\u2019s five largest urban counties \u2013 Harris (Houston), Travis (Austin), Bexar (San Antonio), Tarrant (Fort Worth) and Dallas \u2013 the change is even more stark. In 2012, Obama won them by a combined 131,000 votes. By 2016, Clinton expanded the Democratic margin across those five counties to 562,000 votes. In 2018, O\u2019Rourke won those counties by a combined 790,000 votes, about six times more than Obama did in 2012. Along the way, Democrats ousted Republican US House incumbents in suburban Houston and Dallas seats and made substantial gains in municipal and state house elections across most of the major metro areas. \u201cWe have now turned every major metropolitan area blue,\u201d says Glenn Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist in the state. Yet that, of course, still wasn\u2019t enough for O\u2019Rourke to overcome Cruz\u2019s huge advantages in smaller nonmetro communities. That outcome underscores the equation facing Texas Democrats in 2020 and beyond: They must reduce the GOP\u2019s towering margins outside of the major metropolitan areas and/or expand their own advantage inside the metro centers. Few in either party give Democrats much chance to record many gains outside of metro Texas, especially given Trump\u2019s national strength with such voters. O\u2019Rourke campaigned heavily in Texas\u2019 smaller counties and made very limited inroads there, even relative to Clinton\u2019s abysmal performance in 2016. Exit polls conducted for a consortium of media organizations including CNN found that O\u2019Rourke carried just 26% of white voters without a college education, only a minuscule improvement from the 21% Clinton won in Texas in 2016. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s very limited rural gains have convinced many Texas Democrats that while they can\u2019t entirely abandon smaller parts of the state, their new votes are most likely to come from the metropolitan centers. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of emphasis,\u201d says Smith, a senior adviser to the liberal group Progress Texas. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do urban/ suburban areas first. You\u2019ve got to maximize your advantage there.\u201d The stakes in the struggle for Texas\u2019 big metro areas are rising because they are growing so fast. While the four major metro areas cast about 60% of the statewide votes in the 1996 presidential election, that rose to about 69% in 2016 and 2018, Murray and Cross found. Murray expects the number to cross 70% in 2020. And the concentration of Texas\u2019 population into its biggest metropolitan areas shows no signs of slackening. The Texas Demographic Center, the official state demographer, projects that 70% of the state\u2019s population growth through 2050 will settle in just 10 large metropolitan counties. Those include the big five urban centers that O\u2019Rourke carried as well as five adjacent suburban counties; those adjacent counties still leaned toward the GOP in 2018 but by a much smaller cumulative margin than in the past. Overall, O\u2019Rourke won the 10 counties expected to account for the preponderance of the state\u2019s future growth by a combined nearly 700,000 votes. This urbanization is unfolding together with growing diversification. From 2010 through 2018, the US Census Bureau found, non-Hispanic whites accounted for only 14% of Texas\u2019 population growth; Asian-American growth roughly equaled whites\u2019, African Americans slightly exceeded both and Hispanics dwarfed all three \u2013 they accounted for over 55% of Texas\u2019 population growth in that period. An analysis conducted for a consortium of progressive groups similarly found that minorities will account for fully 88% of the newly eligible Texas voters between 2016 and 2020, with Hispanics alone accounting for 60%, according to sources familiar with the study. The Texas Demographic Center forecasts that Hispanics could supplant whites as the state\u2019s largest population group by as soon as 2022. Most of that minority growth is occurring inside the state\u2019s big metropolitan areas, further accelerating their transformation: Harris County last year elected a 27-year-old Latina to its top countywide position and nearby Fort Bend elected an Indian American. But the impact of this demographic change has been blunted by consistently low turnout for nonwhite voters in Texas, where Democrats and other liberal groups have lacked the funds to conduct meaningful voter drives for years, and GOP-passed laws, from strict voter identification requirements to limits on voter registration drives, have erected hurdles to greater minority participation. Only about one-third of eligible Hispanics turned out in 2018, the Census Bureau reported. Democrats are cautiously hopeful that a backlash against Trump in minority communities will improve their turnout in 2020, particularly after a young white man echoed Trump\u2019s language of \u201cinvasion\u201d before carrying out the recent mass shooting in El Paso. \u201cThat\u2019s always this question I have been hearing since I got here: What is going to increase Hispanic turnout in Texas?\u201d said Joshua Blank, manager of polling and research at the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Texas Politics Project. \u201cI think the idea of a white supremacist, in the political environment we\u2019re in, specifically targeting a majority Hispanic city like El Paso \u2026 is likely to be a pretty good wake-up call. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d It\u2019s possible that greater minority engagement could increase the nonwhite share of the Texas vote from the 43% that exit polls recorded in 2016 and 2018. But given Trump\u2019s ability to mobilize turnout among his preponderantly white non-urban base, even greater minority participation might be offset by high turnout among rural whites. The sheer weight of the state\u2019s urbanization and diversification will eventually undermine a Trump-type strategy that focuses on maximizing the party\u2019s margins outside metro areas at the price of eroding its strength within them. But to close the gap in the next few elections, Democrats may need not only greater turnout but also slightly improved vote shares among their best groups: minorities and especially college-educated white voters. In contrast to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s limited gains among blue-collar whites, exit polls did show him improving substantially with those college-educated white voters: O\u2019Rourke carried 44% of them, up from just 31% for Clinton two years earlier. The most recent Quinnipiac University Poll in Texas showed that among those voters only a narrow 52% to 43% majority approved of Trump\u2019s performance. Quinnipiac found a sharp gender gap, with 56% of college-educated white men approving of Trump and 54% of women disapproving. Still, those numbers are notably better than Trump\u2019s showing with those college-educated white voters in most national surveys. And they reflect the challenge Democrats face expanding beyond the beachheads they have established in suburban Texas communities. One is that more white suburbanites in Texas than elsewhere are evangelical Christians, perhaps the group now most staunchly supportive of Trump and the GOP. In 2018, the exit polls found that about 40% of college-educated white voters in Texas identified as evangelicals, and they backed Cruz by overwhelming margins, according to figures provided by Edison Research, which conducts the exit polls. Also, as Blank says, whatever their religious affiliation, Texas suburbanites are marinated in a political culture much more conservative on almost all issues than comparable suburbs elsewhere. Democrats offering big new programs and higher taxes may still face more resistance in the suburbs of Texas than states such as California and Colorado, particularly among men. \u201cRegardless of the rapid demographic change that is going on in the state, it still maintains a pretty conservative political culture writ large,\u201d Blank says. \u201cIn a place like Texas, as opposed to some of these upper Midwest or Northeastern states, by no means does going to college here mean you are having an overwhelmingly liberalizing experience. Some of these schools are tied to rural Texas and Christianity: It is not like we have Yale and Harvard and Swarthmore down here.\u201d Still, Blank notes, the diverse young families now filling the suburbs of Texas\u2019 largest metropolitan areas are very different from the predominantly white families who powered their first wave of growth after the 1960s: While those earlier suburbanites were largely fleeing racially diverse cities, their successors today want to remain close to the cities while securing more affordable housing. \u201cFundamentally, that\u2019s a different kind of mindset,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s a mindset that tends to align more with Democratic Party values.\u201d For 2020, both sides are preparing extensive voter-mobilization efforts targeted mostly at the major metropolitan areas. Dickey says the state GOP, which for years faced little effective challenge to its control, will launch a major organizational effort next year with both paid staff and volunteers to roll back the 2018 Democratic gains in the big population centers. \u201cThe question is whether that was a trend or a dip,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer is that depends on us. Will we do the work necessary to win back the geographic areas that we had as recently as 2014?\u201d But Murray says that in Texas, as in other states, Trump\u2019s racially divisive messaging leaves the GOP facing a stiff headwind in metropolitan areas growing mostly with minority and well-educated white voters. \u201cTrump is killing the urban Republican Party,\u201d Murray says flatly. If that proves true even in Texas, whether in 2020 or soon after, it will fundamentally reshape the national electoral landscape.",

            "article_content": "Former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, said in a blistering op-ed for The New York Times that Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cexploit the radioactive energy of racism\u201d are \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than he realizes. \u201cAmerica has long had a radioactive racist soup in the center of our national life. Donald Trump thinks he is stirring it for political benefit. He\u2019s actually doing something more dangerous,\u201d Comey wrote in the piece published Sunday. Comey\u2019s comments come after a series of racist tweets from Trump last month aimed at lawmakers of color and in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, where a white supremacist killed at least 20 people in a shopping center \u2013 one of two massacres by gunmen in the US in less than 24 hours. Earlier Sunday, Trump tweeted, \u201cGod bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton, Ohio,\u201d and, separately, ordered American flags to be flown at half-staff as \u201ca mark of solemn respect\u201d for the victims of the tragedies. Trump: 'Perhaps more has to be done' on gun violence \u201cEvery American president, knowing what lies deep within our country, bears a unique responsibility to say loudly and consistently that white supremacy is illegitimate, that encouraging a politics of racial resentment can spawn violence, and that violence aimed at people by virtue of their skin color is terrorism,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cMr. President, because of what you have done, you owe us more than condolences sent via Twitter. You must stop trying to unleash and exploit the radioactive energy of racism.\u201d Comey cited Trump\u2019s silence during a \u201csend her back\u201d chant aimed at minority Congresswoman Illhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, and his remarks in 2017 that there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides of a Charlottesville, Virginia, neo-Nazi rally as evidence Trump is stirring \u201cracist soup\u201d for his benefit. \u201cOur president thinks he is doing something clever. He lifts the control rods for a calculated and deeply cynical purpose: to harness the political energy unleashed,\u201d Comey says. \u201cIt will heat his re-election bid, he likely thinks. But unconstrained, it will damage the nation, in all directions. Only fools believe they can ride the gamma rays of hate.\u201d Prompted by the shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, Democrats used similarly pointed language to describe Trump on Sunday. Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O\u2019Rourke told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday that he views Trump as a white nationalist. Beto O'Rourke: President Donald Trump is a white nationalist \u201cThe things that he has said both as a candidate and then as the President of the United States, this cannot be open for debate,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Speaking to reporters on a tarmac in New Jersey Sunday after a weekend spent at his golf club in Bedminster, Trump said, \u201cHate has no place in our country and we\u2019re gonna take care of it.\u201d The President added that \u201cperhaps more has to be done\u201d to address gun violence,\u201d but he did not address questions related to white supremacy. Comey ended his op-ed with a call to action for Trump, writing that the President holds \u201cthe biggest control rod of all.\u201d \u201cYou must push it back into place, for all our sakes. The vast majority of Americans believe the core ideals of our founding documents and we expect our culture to reflect those ideals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShow us you believe in them, too.\u201d",

And they are happy as hell.\u201d Donald Trump made 78 false claims last week Since the controversy over Trump\u2019s comments about Baltimore and Cummings is too new to be captured by most of the available polling data, we can\u2019t definitively fact-check Trump\u2019s claim about African Americans\u2019 views on these remarks \u2013 though it\u2019s worth noting that Trump has a history of inventing nonexistent phone calls and making dubious claims about people expressing gratitude him in private conversations. We can, however, definitively fact-check his claim that African Americans are generally pleased with his performance. They are not. Facts First: African Americans are overwhelmingly unhappy with Trump\u2019s job performance, polls have consistently shown. Exit polls of the 2016 election found that Trump received 8% of votes cast by African Americans, with 89% of them choosing Democrat Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls in the subsequent two-and-a-half years have found that he remains highly unpopular among African Americans. Trump began talking negatively about Cummings and Baltimore in a series of tweets on July 27. In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from July 25 to July 28 \u2013 two days before the tweets, the day of the tweets, and one day after the tweets \u2013 Trump had a 6% approval rating and 84% disapproval rating with black voters. Eighty percent of black voters said Trump is racist, while just 11% said he is not. A Fox News poll conducted from July 21 to July 23 had Trump at 75% disapproval among black registered voters, with 22% approval. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted June 28 to July 1, 81% of African Americans said they disapproved; 18% approved. Both of those approval numbers were substantially better than the one in the new Quinnipiac poll, but still: On the whole, large majorities of African Americans were displeased with him. Trump\u2019s tweets about Cummings and Baltimore were not identical to his tweets about four Democratic congresswomen of color two weeks prior. But it\u2019s important to note that black voters were unhappy about those earlier tweets: 76% in the Fox News poll said it is racist to tell a person of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their country of origin, while 9% said it was not. (Only one of the four congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar, was born abroad.) In the Fox poll, just 11% of black registered voters approved of how he was handling race relations; 83% disapproved. And, when asked if Trump respects racial minorities, 78% of black registered voters said no. Trump has emphasized the economy in his pitch to black voters, noting on Tuesday and on numerous previous occasions that the African American unemployment rate has fallen to a record low 6.0% during his tenure. (It fell from 12.7% to 7.9% under President Barack Obama, then from 7.9% to 6.0% under Trump.) But black voters remain unhappy with Trump even on the economy in particular: 64% in the Fox News poll disapproved of his handling of the issue. There was not a single issue on which black voters in the Fox poll gave him a net positive rating.",

Beto looks baaaaad: The last three months have not been kind to former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 defined by a listless debate performance and an even more listless campaign that seems to not really know what it wants to be or where it wants to go. But even with all of those struggles, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s second quarter fundraising numbers \u2013 $3.6 million, down from $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his campaign \u2013 was a stunner. That O\u2019Rourke spent $5.3 million while raising almost $2 million less than that is of deep concern to the campaign\u2019s future. O\u2019Rourke needs something major to change the arc of his candidacy, which has been trending steadily downward since he entered the race on March 14 or, as these money numbers reveal, he could find himself without the money to fund the major national campaign he has built. Circle July 30 on your calendar. Beto will be in the first CNN debate in Detroit and absolutely MUST find a way to show some life \u2013 or run the risk of watching his once-promising candidacy end sooner than he\u2019d like. 4. The \u201cMedicare for All\u201d fight, continued: The central policy fight in the Democratic race is \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 which candidates support abolishing private health insurance to make way for a government-run \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts support that move. California Sen. Kamala Harris sort of, sometimes does. And former Vice President Joe Biden very much does not. \u201cI\u2019m not a big guy on Medicare for All, but I will tell you what \u2013 over my dead political body are we going to get rid of Obamacare,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser in California on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build on it.\u201d What do you want to hear the candidates discuss in next week\u2019s CNN debate? Vote here. Sanders has insisted Biden is mischaracterizing the impact of abolishing Obamacare and replacing it with Medicare for All. \u201cJoe is a friend of mine and he has different points of view on health care than I do,\u201d Sanders said in Iowa on Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s great. We\u2019ll debate those issues. But we should not have a distortion of what Medicare for All stands for.\u201d This is a fundamental disagreement within the Democratic Party. Neither side will cave. Both believe voters are with them. The primary fight could well swing on who is right. 3. Bernie has a hypocrisy issue: There\u2019s nothing voters dislike more than a candidate telling them how to do something but not living up to that same standard in his or her own life. Enter Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, which, as expertly reported by The Washington Post\u2019s Sean Sullivan this week, isn\u2019t paying some of his field organizers the $15/hour minimum wage that the senator has insisted should be the national standard. And Sanders\u2019 initial reaction to the news wasn\u2019t, um, great. \u201cIt does bother me that people are going outside of the process and going to the media,\u201d he told The Des Moines Register on Friday. \u201cThat is really not acceptable. It is really not what labor negotiations are about, and it\u2019s improper.\u201d (Sanders\u2019 campaign was the first in the 2020 field to unionize.) Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN that the campaign had offered field staff a raise that would guarantee a $15 an hour salary but that the proposal had been rejected.

Unfortunately for Sanders, this controversy is coming at exactly the wrong time, as he is only 10 days away from standing next to his main rivals for liberal votes \u2013 Warren \u2013 on stage at the CNN-sponsored Detroit debate on July 30. 2. Trump\u2019s race campaign continues: A week after sparking a massive firestorm by sending a series of racist tweets about four, non-white Democratic congresswomen, the President of the United States got up on Sunday morning and tweeted this: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party, but are weak & insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!\u201d There\u2019s no debate that Trump believes these sorts of appeals to racial biases are effective in rallying his base. He has done it time and time again during his four years in public life. And he will continue to do it \u2013 even while his aides insist he isn\u2019t actually doing it. (This is about patriotism, not racism, they insist, unconvincingly.) Rep. Elijah Cummings: Trump's 'go back' comments bring back painful memories of childhood racism Trump\u2019s weaponizing of race will be a prominent feature of the 2020 campaign. And it will only get uglier as the election gets closer \u2013 particularly if Trump believes he is losing. That is certain. What is less certain is how Democrats running against him deal with it. Engage and play his game? Or ignore and let his racist attacks fester? 1. It\u2019s Mueller time: When former special counsel Robert Mueller comes to Congress Wednesday to testify about the findings of his eponymous report, all of the 2020 candidates will be like us \u2013 sitting on the sidelines and watching. Mueller will testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. (California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who is on both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, dropped from the presidential race earlier this month.) But just because none of the 2020 players will be, uh, players in the Mueller drama doesn\u2019t lessen its potential import in the 2020 race. As The New York Times put it in a headline Sunday, \u201cMueller Hearings on Wednesday Present Make-or-Break Moment for Democrats.\u201d Democrats \u2013 in Congress and in the 2020 race (and there\u2019s plenty of overlap between those two groups!) \u2013 have been pointed at Mueller\u2019s testimony as the moment when the public really becomes aware of what this President did to obstruct the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election \u2013 and why. And/but, Mueller has been quite clear that a) he didn\u2019t want to testify and b) he has zero plans to go beyond what was in the 448-page written report. All of which makes Wednesday a huge moment in the presidential race.",

            "article_content": "To the very end, John Paul Stevens was a different kind of Supreme Court justice and a distinctive individual. He died at age 99 on Tuesday, practically with pen in hand, having just finished his third book and deeply engaged in debate on the law. The 1975 appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford offered proof of the notion \u2013 perhaps a quaint notion today \u2013 that jurists do not forever hew to the interests of the men who appointed them. Stevens became a liberal bulwark on the contemporary court. By the time he retired after a nearly 35-year tenure, he stood out for his trenchant dissents protesting the conservative majority, in cases from Bush v. Gore in 2000 to the Citizens United campaign finance ruling in 2010. A brilliant yet unassuming Chicagoan who favored silk bowties, he was as genial and generous as he was prolific and long-serving. He telephoned me back in April, out of the blue, to chat about the current court and compare notes on our respective book endeavors. He sounded as sharp and energized as ever. Dividing his time between Washington and a home in Florida, he was still trying to take a daily swim in the ocean. In public appearances, Stevens worried aloud about the state of national affairs, specifically President Donald Trump and what has been a partisan and confrontational approach to the bench. \u201cI hope he won\u2019t do too much damage,\u201d he told CNN anchor John Berman in a televised interview as he spoke of his recently released memoir. Asked if he thought Trump understood the role of the federal judiciary, Stevens said flatly, \u201cNo.\u201d The full assessment was classic Stevens: direct but not cheeky. The World War II Navy officer who earned the Bronze Star and then the highest grades in his class at Northwestern University law school was nonetheless most comfortable out of the limelight. Yet even as his understated personal style and unfailing courtesy seemed to make him a relic of another era, he took a decidedly modern approach to the law. He voted for same-sex marriage and abortion rights and shifted his early views against racial remedies to support affirmative action and efforts for diversity. He passionately dissented as the Roberts Court majority rolled back campaign finance regulations. \u201cWhile American democracy is imperfect,\u201d Stevens wrote in his last notable dissent, in the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, \u201cfew outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.\u201d As he penned commentary in retirement, Stevens continued to target the influence of big money on electoral politics. He also proposed repeal of the Second Amendment. One of the four dissenters to a 2008 Supreme Court ruling that declared an individual right to bear arms, Stevens in a 2018 New York Times op-ed wrote, \u201cThat decision \u2013 which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable \u2013 has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power.\u201d Stevens later explained to CNN the importance of his dissents and commentary into his late 90s: \u201cSometimes the country may rethink problems and may come to a different conclusion. And having your views out there should be part of the continuing debate about the issues.\u201d Retired Supreme Court Justice speaks on Trump's actions Silver-haired and soft-spoken even as he challenged the existing state of affairs, Stevens witnessed a transformed America as well as changed legal landscape. Born in 1920, he was the son of a wealthy Chicago developer and became a private pilot, champion bridge player and tennis enthusiast. He was \u201cgood with a racquet,\u201d he once told me, again understating things as he recounted a time that Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor (now retired) challenged him to a table-tennis match. As he toured and touted his new memoir (\u201cThe Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years\u201d) this spring, he referred to his proficiency at ping pong. In a similar vein, even as he served as the senior liberal on the high court from 1994 (when Justice Harry Blackmun retired) to 2010, assigning opinions for the left and crafting compromises for narrow majorities when possible, Stevens downplayed his leadership. He wrote the majority opinion in a 2007 milestone case related to the climate crisis that found the Environmental Protection Agency had authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Massachusetts v. EPA was decided 5-4. Stevens also helped build another five-justice coalition that enhanced the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The effort, manifest in a 2000 decision ensuring that all facts that increase a defendant\u2019s potential sentence be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, was a strong interest of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia as well. \u201cI led the charge,\u201d Scalia told me in one of our interviews over the years. When I happened to relate that remark to the more senior Stevens, he suggested that was not exactly how he would put it. But Stevens quickly added, \u201cIf that\u2019s the way he assesses it, that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m happy to have him think he led the charge.\u201d That sentiment reflected what former President Barack Obama on Wednesday called Stevens\u2019 \u201csignature pragmatism and modesty.\u201d Hear Justice John Paul Stevens reflect on nearly a century of life Stevens sat ringside to history, meeting Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh at his family\u2019s hotel and forever recounting his presence at Wrigley Field when Babe Ruth called his shot and hit a home run in the 1932 World Series. Early in his legal career, Stevens, who had been a law clerk to Justice Wiley Rutledge, specialized in antitrust law. President Richard Nixon appointed Stevens in 1970 to the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1975, Ford took the advice of his Attorney General Edward Levi (also a Chicagoan) and elevated Stevens to the seat of retiring Justice William O. Douglas. The Senate confirmed Stevens by a 98-0 vote in December 1975. The justice often expressed amazement that the Senate Judiciary Committee never asked his views on Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court had decided in 1973. It was a sign of how little the decision that made abortion legal nationwide had then entered the political sphere when it came to confirming justices. It was also a sign of how different judicial politics were in Stevens\u2019 early chapters on the high court. During most of his tenure he served with justices who defied easy ideological label, such as Byron White, an appointee of President John F. Kennedy who regularly voted on the right; Lewis Powell, a Nixon appointee who amassed a moderate record; and David Souter, who was named by George H.W. Bush and became known for liberalism in sync with Stevens. (Many Republicans later criticized Souter, considering his record a betrayal, and GOP presidents since his 1990 appointment have more carefully screened their high court candidates.) Souter retired in 2009, a year before Stevens, and the full end of the age of justices unaligned with their presidential benefactors came in 2018, with the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a centrist conservative appointed by Ronald Reagan. During the confirmation of Kennedy\u2019s successor, Brett Kavanaugh, Stevens expressed dismay about the volatile hearings and said there was \u201cmerit\u201d to criticism that Trump\u2019s nominee had \u201cdemonstrated potential bias\u201d toward some potential litigants. But Stevens softened on that score in recent months, telling CNN\u2019s Berman, \u201cPerhaps I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did. I think his decisions will determine how good a judge he\u2019ll be.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris has claimed her presidential campaign is being targeted on social media by Russian bots. But while US intelligence officials say Russian disinformation campaigns targeting Americans continue, verified evidence of attacks on specific candidates has yet to publicly emerge. Harris\u2019 claims come as \u201cRussian bots\u201d have become a catchall description, for some, of any disinformation spread online. Democrats could even potentially view the perception that they have been targeted by Russian trolls as politically advantageous \u2013 another way to contrast themselves to President Donald Trump, who has publicly sowed doubt about the veracity and implications of Russian cyber meddling, despite warnings from intelligence officials. A Twitter spokesperson told CNN that the company had no evidence that Harris was the target of state-backed bots. Facebook would not say if it had found any Russian activity relating to Harris or other Democratic candidates. Both Twitter and Facebook infamously failed to detect expansive disinformation campaigns run from Russia in 2016. Faith in the companies\u2019 ability to detect covert information campaigns may be justifiably low and it may very well later emerge that some of the attacks on Harris emanate from Russia. However, the senator appears to have insufficient evidence to make the assertion as she did. In the years since America learned Russia had run a vast cyber and social media offensive targeting the 2016 US presidential election, politicians, media outlets, researchers and academics have sometimes incorrectly attributed nefarious online activity to Russia. Disinformation campaigns run by domestic actors, Iran and other nation-states can sometimes be overshadowed by the propensity to falsely attribute activity to Russia. How Kamala Harris conspiracies festered online before making it to Trump Jr. Harris faced a flood of attacks that sought to undermine her racial identity during last month\u2019s presidential debate after she recounted being bused to school as a child. CNN documented how the attacks had been festering online for months, before being elevated to the mainstream on debate night, when Donald Trump Jr. shared a tweet sent by one user with the assertion, \u201cKamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican.\u201d That user subsequently attended President Trump\u2019s social media summit that took place at the White House last week. Although CNN found that some of the accounts that attacked Harris during the debate were later suspended, a Twitter spokesperson said that the company had not detected any automatic bot activity. Automatic bots allow one user to send tweets across multiple accounts at once, which can have the effect of making it appear an issue or talking point is gaining traction. Why it's getting harder to spot a deepfake video Appearing on The Breakfast Club radio show on Friday, Harris was asked if she thought she was being targeted by Russian bots. \u201cWell, we already know we are,\u201d she responded. The Harris campaign provided links to a number of news articles when CNN asked what evidence it had that Russia was involved in the attacks. Some of the stories cited respected researchers who say some of the influence campaigns they see playing out on social media bear the hallmarks of state-backed disinformation campaigns. None of the stories, however, include confirmation from the social media companies or the US intelligence community of Russian involvement. Such confirmation has in the past taken months or years to be made public, although last November, Facebook said it had taken down a network of suspected Russian accounts just before the midterm elections, acting on a tip from the FBI. Benjamin T. Decker, the founder of Memetica, a digital investigations consultancy, has been tracking the spread of memes attacking Harris\u2019 racial identity. He urged caution on blaming Russia. \u201cIn many ways, claims that \u2018the Russian bots did it\u2019 deflect from the myriad of sociopolitical problems that we face as Americans, because the majority of political disinformation is being created by and for American audiences,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts saved Obamacare in 2012 by calling it a tax. Now, his core argument is helping power a Republican-led legal challenge that threatens to sweep away the entire law. The Affordable Care Act faces its third major legal test since President Barack Obama signed it in 2010, putting access to health insurance for millions of Americans and coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer and diabetes, into question. The appeals court case, heard in New Orleans on Tuesday, may also complicate the legacy of the chief justice, who has attempted to keep the Supreme Court out of politics but could soon face another presidential election-year health care dispute. Roberts, a 2005 appointee of Republican George W. Bush, forged a compromise in 2012 with the four Supreme Court liberal justices to uphold the signature domestic achievement of Obama. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare In dramatic moves behind the scenes, Roberts shifted multiple times in that landmark Obamacare challenge. After the 2012 case was argued, Roberts was part of a five-justice majority that wanted to strike down the individual insurance mandate. But he became wary of voiding a significant part of the law that was years in the making and reconsidered. That eventual 2012 decision has shaped public perceptions of the chief justice, who since then has been viewed with skepticism by conservatives even as his record \u2013 for example, on racial issues, campaign finance and religion \u2013 remains solidly on the right. Roberts\u2019 opinion is now at the center of the legal debate seven years later. His 2012 rationale for upholding the ACA\u2019s individual insurance mandate was tied to Congress\u2019 taxing power. Texas and other Republican-led states, backed by the Trump administration, contend that when Congress zeroed out the tax penalty in 2017 for people who failed to obtain insurance, it eviscerated its constitutional grounds. \u201cThe entire basis,\u201d for the 2012 decision, Texas solicitor general Kyle Hawkins argued Tuesday, \u201cis now off the table.\u201d Without the linchpin of the individual insurance mandate, he said, the entire law must fall. How John Roberts controls the Supreme Court Lawyers for California and other Democratic-led states, along with the Democratic-run US House of Representatives, countered on Tuesday that even without a tax penalty, the individual mandate remains constitutional, as does the entire ACA. \u201cThere\u2019s another way to read\u201d the 2012 Roberts\u2019 decision, insisted Douglas Letter, counsel for the US House. He argued that Roberts\u2019 opinion said people had a choice whether to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Letter said that choice remains, even if the tax penalty is zero. \u201cThe choice that Chief Justice Roberts made clear to all of us is there,\u201d he said, stressing that the chief sought a way to preserve the law on some constitutional grounds. \u201cI know Texas is unhappy with what Chief Justice Roberts did. They wish he had done something different. But he didn\u2019t. \u2026 And that is binding.\u201d The future of the health-insurance overhaul appears destined to return to the Supreme Court and Roberts, whose views on the 2017 tax change are not known. Last December, a US district court judge agreed with the Republican challengers and ruled that because the tax penalty is now zero, the entire health care law is unconstitutional. On Tuesday, a panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals appeared poised to find that at least a significant part of the ACA should fall, if not all of it. That panel is not expected to rule for several months. When it does, the case of Texas v. United States is likely bound for the Supreme Court where, despite recent changes among the nine, the majority that previously upheld the law \u2013 Roberts and four liberal justices \u2013 is still there. This new case could be the most consequential test of Obamacare yet. Millions of Americans now obtain their health insurance through the ACA-created exchanges or Medicaid expansion. Among the law\u2019s provisions, people with cancer, diabetes or other pre-existing conditions cannot be refused coverage and children can stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26. Republican-appointed judges appear to side with Texas challenge to Obamacare The Trump administration initially argued that, based on the 2017 tax law change, only the individual mandate and two related provisions tied to protections for people pre-existing health conditions should be invalidated. But now its Justice Department is agreeing with Texas that the entire law should be struck down because, they insist, the law\u2019s many provisions are intertwined. If one is unconstitutional, so is the rest, they say \u2013 a ruling that if upheld could give Trump the result of killing Obamacare that he couldn\u2019t accomplish with a GOP-controlled Congress in 2017. A majority of the three-judge panel on Tuesday signaled by their questions that they were sympathetic to that position. The 100-minute hearing was dominated by two Republican-appointed judges: Jennifer Elrod, named by President George W. Bush, and Kurt Engelhardt, appointed by President Donald Trump. The third judge \u2013 Carolyn Dineen King, named to the bench by Democrat Jimmy Carter \u2013 asked no questions during the hearing. When House counsel Letter argued that judges should follow Roberts\u2019 approach to save the ACA in 2012, Elrod suggested she believed the 2017 tax change altered Roberts\u2019 premise in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. Elrod asserted that linking the individual mandate to a \u201crevenue-producing\u201d measure was \u201cessential.\u201d Engelhardt questioned why, after a US district judge declared the whole ACA unconstitutional, Congress did not pass legislation clarifying what provisions should stay on the books. \u201cWhy does Congress want the \u2026 judiciary to become the taxidermist for every legislative big-game accomplishment that Congress achieves?\u201d Engelhardt asked. Letter responded in part by repeating the traditional Supreme Court principle that judges should uphold as much of a piece of legislation as possible when one part is found invalid. If judges follow the lessons of the Supreme Court majority, Letter insisted to the 5th Circuit panel, \u201cyou will keep in place the overwhelming percentage of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The positions of Republican appointees Elrod and Engelhardt, while no doubt arising from valid constitutional concerns, reinforced the partisan cast of the case that has pitted red states against blue states, the Republican Trump administration against the Democratic House. 'The Chief': John Roberts' journey from 'sober puss' to the pinnacle of American law Such political currents would likely draw the notice of Roberts, who has been trying to keep the US judiciary above the partisan fray. The simple makeup of the high court does not make that easy. The five conservatives, including Roberts, were appointed by Republican presidents. The four liberals were appointed by Democrats. They often vote along ideological, if not political, lines. In the recently completed Supreme Court session, however, Roberts inched to the left in key cases and appeared to be trying to bridge the court\u2019s divide in these politically volatile times. Those moves recalled the Obamacare decision that, even seven years later, defines him in the public eye.",

            "article_content": "Recent shifts in the Democratic primary are raising the prospect that a new political glass ceiling may shatter in 2020 \u2013 a duel for a presidential ticket between two women. An escalation in the intensity of campaigning in recent weeks, the fallout from the first Democratic debate and a new CNN poll have revealed a key early pivot point in the campaign. And current momentum is lifting two women \u2013 Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 who are rising as their campaigns begin to hit their strides. The two men who have led in the primary polls for most of the year, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, are meanwhile suddenly facing headwinds. Harris, building on her biting attacks on Biden\u2019s record opposing federally mandated desegregation busing, surged nine points from May in the CNN/SSRS poll to 17% behind the former vice president, who is down by 10 points to 22%. Warren, who was also strong in her debate, and has been steadily drawing attention with a less abrupt rise than Harris, is at 15%, up a solid eight points from May. Polls this early in the race only offer a snapshot of the first few months of hostilities but they are useful for establishing trends developing among the major candidates. And anecdotally, Harris and Warren came across in their first debates last week as among the most assured and crisp candidates on stage \u2013 an important distinction as party voters consider who would be the best fit to take on the fearsome challenge of President Donald Trump. But with first nominating contests still seven months off, this is a long road. And despite a wobbly debate performance, Biden still has strong support among Democrats on the issues that motivate Democratic voters. He also holds a statistically insignificant three-point advantage over Warren and Harris in the CNN poll, 20% to 17%. Neither Harris nor Warren have made their gender a centerpiece of their campaigns so far, and it does not appear either candidate is doing well simply because they are women. Warren has transformed the ideological debate in the Democratic primary with her flurry of plans targeting greater economic equality and by going deep on issues. This came after many pundits wrote her off for her clumsy handling of a controversy over her claims to have native American ancestry. Harris got her spurt with a vigorous attack on Biden\u2019s past positions on racial issues in a clash with the former vice president on the debate stage last week, which showcased the skills she developed as a former top prosecutor. She has stumbled, however, on some issues of policy and has sometimes adopted conflicting positions on whether a \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d program would mean Americans losing private insurance. But that two women have moved into the top tier of a major party\u2019s presidential nominating fight for the first time may start to answer one of the big unknowns that was festering at the start of the 2020 race. The anger and disappointment that many Democratic women voters felt at the defeat of Hillary Clinton, so far, does not seem to be prejudicing them against a possible female nominee this time. Clinton herself has raised the question of whether sexism was among the reasons that she failed in her bid to become the first woman President, after she lost to Trump. Her defeat led to some assessments that America was not yet ready to elect a female President, though it could be argued that the former first lady\u2019s years of political baggage had as much to do with her defeat as her gender. And though she lost the Electoral College, Clinton won the popular vote by a 3 million strong margin. Some of her defeats in key states could arguably be put down to tactical decisions as much as her gender. But the pessimism about the possibility of a female president was deeply felt. A Time/SSRS poll conducted last year found that more than half of women \u2013 56% \u2013 believed that it was unlikely a woman could be elected president in 2020. That is a remarkable figure considering the narrowness of Clinton\u2019s defeat. Yet there are grounds to think that just two-and-half years after that grim night for Democrats, those sentiments could soon change. In fact, over the last few years, much of the energy in the Democratic Party has been generated by female candidates, especially younger rising stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What critics see as Trump\u2019s misogynist tendencies and the #MeToo movement have also emphasized the growing power of women in political, social and business life \u2013 despite the still uneven playing field. Those forces are reflected in the party\u2019s Democratic field \u2013 six women were on stage at the first two primary debates last week, though they were still outnumbered by 14 men. The early surge by Warren and Harris has not been matched by other female candidates. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand are barely registering in polls. Biden has already had to weather a campaign crisis over his tactile political style, which some women said made them feel uncomfortable. It was one of a number of episodes that have raised the most fundamental liability of his campaign, the sense that he may be out of touch with modern sensibilities after a political career that has spanned nearly half a century. But Biden also has a long record in working on issues important to women \u2013 including the Violence Against Women Act. Neither Harris nor Warren seems to have any concern that their gender will thwart their presidential hopes. Harris broached the idea of doubling down with an all-female ticket in an interview with Sirius XM radio in April. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be fabulous?\u201d she said. In a CNN town hall earlier this year, Warren was asked by Ellie Taylor, a Harvard University student about the possibility of taking on Trump as a female presidential nominee. \u201cSome have voiced concerns about you getting Hillary-ed in the election, meaning that you get held to a higher standard than your opponent for potentially arbitrary or may be even sexist reasons,\u201d Taylor said. Warren responded that she had been told she\u2019d lose her first bid for the Senate in Massachusetts because it had never had a female senator or governor. She said she would tell little girls \u201cHi, my name is Elizabeth and I\u2019m running for Senate because that\u2019s what girls do.\u201d \u201cSo the way I see it is, here we are in a presidential (campaign), and it\u2019s the same kind of \u2013 you stay after it every day.\u201d \u201cOne might say you persist,\u201d she said, playing off what was widely seen as a sexist comment once made about her by Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Ultimately, the question of who the Democratic Party will select to take on Trump seems likely turn on the question of who its voters feel have the best chance to beat the President. Currently, Biden is well ahead on this metric \u2013 43% of Democratic voters say he is best positioned to beat Trump, ahead of Sanders on 13% and Warren and Harris who are both tied with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on 12%. Given the strong motivation of Democrats to oust Trump after a single term, the way that figure evolves may be the one that tells the ultimate story of the two rising Democratic female candidates.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris pushed back Saturday against online attacks about her race, comparing the latest jabs to racism faced by former President Barack Obama, as fellow 2020 candidates rallied to her defense. During Thursday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted to his millions of followers a Harris critic who took issue with her identity. \u201cKamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican,\u201d the critic, who identified as African American, wrote. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It\u2019s disgusting. Now using it for debate time at #DemDebate2? These are my people not her people. Freaking disgusting.\u201d Trump Jr. shared the tweet with the comment, \u201cIs this true? Wow.\u201d He has since deleted the tweet and a spokesman for President Donald Trump\u2019s son told the New York Times that it was a misunderstanding. Who really won? Democratic debates unleash new rivalries and drama \u201cDon\u2019s tweet was simply him asking if it was true that Kamala Harris was half-Indian because it\u2019s not something he had ever heard before,\u201d spokesman Andy Surabian told the Times. \u201cAnd once he saw that folks were misconstruing the intent of his tweet, he quickly deleted it.\u201d Lily Adams, the campaign communications director for Harris, dismissed the attack, explaining that people, including President Trump, used similar rhetoric to question Obama\u2019s birthplace. Obama was born in Hawaii. \u201cThis is the same type of racist attack his father used to attack Barack Obama,\u201d Adams told CNN. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work then and it won\u2019t work now.\u201d Harris shined Thursday night when she took former Vice President Joe Biden to task for trying to prevent the Department of Education\u2019s efforts to enforce school busing to integrate schools during the 1970s. \u201cVice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you, when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut I also believe \u2013 and it\u2019s personal \u2013 it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Harris then invoked her own experience to make the point on the debate stage. \u201cThat little girl was me,\u201d Harris said with emotion swelling in her voice. \u201cSo I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.\u201d Biden defended Harris on Saturday, saying in a tweet that \u201cracism has no place in America.\u201d \u201cThe same forces of hatred rooted in \u2018birtherism\u2019 that questioned @BarackObama\u2019s American citizenship, even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it.\u201d Harris, who was born in the US to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who were both immigrants, has directly confronted critics before who have questioned her black heritage, her record incarcerating minorities as a prosecutor and her decision to marry a white man. In an interview with The Breakfast Club hosts DJ Envy and Charlamagne Tha God that aired in March, the show\u2019s hosts asked the California Democrat to address a series of derogatory memes that have circulated on social media. One of the hosts cited a meme that said Harris is \u201cnot African-American\u201d because her parents were immigrants and she spent her high school years in Canada. \u201cSo I was born in Oakland, and raised in the United States except for the years that I was in high school in Montreal, Canada,\u201d Harris responded with a laugh. \u201cAnd look, this is the same thing they did to Barack (Obama). This is not new to us and so I think that we know what they are trying to do.\u201d \u201cThey are trying to do what has been happening over the last two years, which is powerful voices trying to sow hate and division, and so we need to recognize when we\u2019re being played,\u201d Harris said. Of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren appeared to be the first on Saturday to defend Harris. Kamala Harris raises $2 million in 24 hours after breakout debate \u201cThe attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cWe all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it\u2019s within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks.\u201d A Twitter spokesperson told CNN Sunday that accounts attacking Harris during Thursday\u2019s debate were not automatic \u201cbots,\u201d saying, \u201cWe saw no coordinated use of automation during recent debates.\u201d Other Democrats on the campaign trail chimed in to defend Harris. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee accused the Trump family of \u201cpeddling birtherism,\u201d an apparent reference to the president\u2019s attacks against Obama. \u201cThe coordinated smear campaign on Senator @KamalaHarris is racist and vile, Inslee tweeted. \u201cThe Trump family is peddling birtherism again and it\u2019s incumbent on all of us to speak out against it.\u201d Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke pointed to the \u201clong history of black Americans being told they don\u2019t belong\u2014and millions are kept down and shut out to this day.\u201d Calling for a unified commitment to combating racist rhetoric, O\u2019Rourke added, Harris \u201cis an American. Period. And all of us must call out attempts to question her identity for what they are: racist.\u201d Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg joined the chorus of 2020 supporters, saying it was time to end these attacks. Fact check: Kamala Harris was correct on integration in Berkeley, school district confirms \u201cThe presidential competitive field is stronger because Kamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience. Her first-generation story embodies the American dream. It\u2019s long past time to end these racist, birther-style attacks,\u201d Buttigieg said. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker decided to use blunt language in his Harris defense. \u201d.@KamalaHarris doesn\u2019t have sh** to prove,\u201d he tweeted. Democratic presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro weighed in on the discussion Sunday, calling the online racist attacks \u201cdisgusting\u201d and saying \u201cit has not place in our politics.\u201d \u201cThis is the game that these folks play. They put something out there, you notice what he did, he tweeted it out and then he deleted it. Like a coward so he could say, \u2018Oh, that was just a mistake.\u2019 But he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Castro said on Sunday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s giving voice to these racist utterances about Senator Harris,\u201d Castro said. \u201cWe need to dispel them immediately and condemn them and then not give them any more life because they\u2019re disgusting.\u201d Twitter confirmed to CNN that it had suspended some accounts that had been attacking Harris\u2019 race, but said that those accounts had been suspended for other rule violations. \u201cOur policies ban misleading, deceptive, and spammy behavior and prohibit attempts to game trends or cause unrelated Tweets to appear in search results. We\u2019ve aggressively stepped up our actions in this regard,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to these existing preventative systems, we will be protecting the integrity of the conversation around key topics and trends throughout the election, including during debates. We saw no coordinated use of automation during recent debates.\u201d This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter suggested Friday that a full investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would show that Donald Trump didn\u2019t win the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election. And I think the interference, although not yet quantified, if fully investigated would show that Trump didn\u2019t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,\u201d Carter said at the Carter Center\u2019s retreat in Leesburg, Virginia. Asked if he believes Trump is an illegitimate president, Carter paused for a moment. \u201cBased on what I just said, which I can\u2019t retract,\u201d Carter said to audience laughter. Jimmy Carter, Trump discuss administration's China trade talks Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report found that Russia waged a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d influence campaign during the 2016 election with the goal of electing Trump, but did not establish a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow. Trump was asked to react to Carter during a Saturday news conference in Osaka, Japan. He said Carter is a Democrat and repeating a \u201ctypical talking point.\u201d Trump called Carter a \u201cnice man, terrible president.\u201d Trump defended his 2016 win, saying he \u201cworked harder and worked smarter\u201d than Hillary Clinton. Until now, the former one-term Democratic president had shared a warmer relationship with the current President more than Trump has had with any other living president. Though he has been critical of Trump\u2019s foreign policy and accused him of deepening racial divisions, Carter has also shown a willingness to help Trump. He took a phone call from Trump in April \u2013 the first time the two had spoken \u2013 to discuss US-China trade negotiations. Carter also offered to travel to North Korea in order to meet with Kim Jong Un on Trump\u2019s behalf, according to a Democratic US lawmaker. In 2017, Carter told The New York Times that the media was \u201charder on Trump than any other president certainly that I\u2019ve known about.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

Though her campaign has yet to break through in the polls, Williamson qualified for the debate on the relative strength of her donor base \u2013 part of a dedicated core of support that embraces her uncanny mix of spirituality, anti-corporate rhetoric and the desire to tell \u201cbig truth.\u201d She has offered videos of herself dancing (on Instagram), press releases on self-care and \u2013 more pointedly \u2013 some tough criticism of her Democratic opponents. \u201cToo many Democrats are half-truth tellers,\u201d Williamson said in Iowa earlier this month. \u201cAnd Donald Trump will eat the half-truth tellers alive.\u201d Williamson has written several best-selling books, beginning with her first, \u201cA Return to Love,\u201d which got the attention of Oprah Winfrey. Throughout the night on Thursday, Williamson\u2019s contributions were often unorthodox in both style and substance. \u201cI have had a career not making the political plans, but I have had a career harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people, masses of people,\u201d Williamson said. 'That little girl was me': Harris' attack on Joe Biden steals spotlight at Democratic primary debate Williamson also called out the other candidates on what she perceived was a surface-level discourse: she criticized them for not discussing \u201cAmerican foreign policy in Latin America,\u201d called on them to \u201cget deeper than the superficial fixes\u201d regarding the health care system and underscored the \u201cdeep, deep realms of racial injustice\u201d at play when discussing police shooting incidents. In an unusual turn, Williamson also addressed the Prime Minister of New Zealand when answering a question on her initial plans for a potential presidency, with a statement that has since gone viral. \u201cMy first call is to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who said that her goal is to make New Zealand the place where it\u2019s the best place in the world for a child to grow up,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd I would tell her, girlfriend, you are so on, because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.\u201d In her closing remarks, Williamson turned her attention to Trump, and outlined how she planned on defeating him should she earn the Democratic nomination. \u201cSo I, sir, I have a feeling you know what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field. And, sir, love will win,\u201d Williamson said.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden stumbled into a potential campaign-defining moment Thursday that pitched his effort to win the Democratic nomination onto suddenly shaky ground. Reeling from an attack by a much younger rival, Kamala Harris, the 76-year-old delivered an unfortunate soundbite at the Democratic debate that threatens to symbolize his biggest political liability. \u201cMy time is up,\u201d he said, meaning to cut short one of his own answers but instead drawing attention to a question that haunts his campaign: Has his generation\u2019s time come and gone? Harris\u2019 assault was breathtaking, appeared planned ahead of time and exposed a willingness to attack she had not previously shown in a campaign that started strong but has slumbered ever since. The immediate impressions left after a debate are often not how things appear a few days later. So it may be that Biden\u2019s bad night does not end up being as damaging as it first appeared. It\u2019s even possible that some voters might have been offended at the audacity of the attack by Harris on a man who has been a devoted servant of the Democratic Party for decades. And Biden \u2013 who served as vice president to the nation\u2019s first black President, Barack Obama \u2013 enjoys strong support among African American voters, a crucial Democratic constituency. But it was easily the most compelling and memorable moment of the young 2020 campaign so far and leaves the ex-vice president confronting deeply uncomfortable questions about his hopes. Harris confronts Biden over past efforts to block busing: 'That little girl was me' Biden, on the ropes as he\u2019s rarely been in half a century of public life, snapped his head towards Harris in disbelief as she said, \u201cVice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist\u2026\u201d The California senator was seizing on a recent comment by Biden in which he highlighted his work with segregationist senators in the 1970s to show he could work with people he disagreed with. Beloved by many Democrats after a lifetime overcoming personal tragedies, Biden appeared shocked and deeply hurt to be faulted on civil rights, an issue on which he\u2019s fought for decades. His struggle to respond effectively to Harris - and his decision to invoke a states\u2019 rights argument with all its troubling racial connotations, only compounded the damage. Biden has been trying to dispel the impression that he\u2019s been left behind by a young and diverse party that\u2019s changed under him. As the frontrunner he was always going to be the biggest target \u2013 and he took fire from other rivals, including Rep. Eric Swalwell of California. Not all of his performance was as bad as his exchange with Harris. But debates are won and lost in the breakout moments that can come to define a candidacy. Biden ended the night besieged by questions over whether he is sufficiently nimble and energetic to triumph in the grueling struggle to win the Democratic nomination. His wobbly performance will also renew doubts about his claim that he\u2019s the strongest campaigner to take on Trump in November 2020. The President, who has a merciless nose for political weakness, may have spotted Biden\u2019s vulnerability earlier than anyone. He\u2019s spent recent weeks slamming Biden as \u201cSleepy\u201d and making dark remarks about the mental state of a rival his aides say concerns Trump over his appeal in rust-belt states. There\u2019s little doubt that Biden has the experience required of a President, and as a former vice president, he knows exactly the burdens that come with the Oval Office entail. Swalwell urges Biden to 'pass the torch,' Biden says 'I'm still holding onto that torch' But inevitably, there will now be more questions among Democrats about the wisdom of nominating someone who would be the oldest President ever elected. \u201cI think age is a very legitimate issue,\u201d said David Axelrod, who saw the toll the office of the President can exact when he was a senior adviser to the Obama administration. \u201cThis is the hardest job on the planet. And (it is) sensible to ask the question whether people who are nearing 80 years old when they enter office are prepared for it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why tests like this debate are important,\u201d Axelrod, now a CNN political commentator said. While it was a bad night for Biden, it may not be terminal for his hopes of fulfilling his lifetime dream to be President. He\u2019s not the first veteran politician to take a hammering in a debate. And he may be simply out of practice. He\u2019s not faced comparable stakes since his 2012 debate showdown with GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan \u2013 which he won handily. In his previous presidential campaign in 2008, Biden was outsider throwing bombs at the frontrunners. Now the roles are reversed. And he clearly wasn\u2019t ready for the intensity of the fight. In many ways, Biden performed like his old boss, Obama, who was roughed up by Mitt Romney, as presidents often are in their first reelection debate. His performance also recalled President Ronald Reagan, who appeared old and out of touch in his first debate against Democrat Walter Mondale in the 1984 election. Each of those Presidents licked their wounds and bounced back, and won reelection. Biden now faces a similar assignment to get his campaign back on track in the next debate, to be hosted by CNN at the end of next month. He will need to substantially raise his game. He was a shadow of the witty, vibrant politician who fired off zingers in his debates under intense scrutiny earlier in the 21st century. Harris\u2019s strong performance in Miami immediately established her as a potential rising star of the 2020 campaign. She joins Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who was praised for her performance in the first of the debate double headers on Wednesday. Early debates are often not decisive in selecting a party nominee and questions remains about Harris\u2019 staying power. In a CNN town hall earlier in the campaign, for instance, she stumbled on health care, and has adopted confusing positions on Medicare for All \u2013 perhaps the central issue in the Democratic race. On Friday morning, she was left explaining her health care plan yet again after being one of only two candidates to raise their hand when they were asked \u201cWho here would abolish their private health insurance in favorite of a government-run plan?\u201d Harris said she believed the question was about whether she, personally, would give up her private plan in favor of Medicare and that she does not favor abolishing private insurance. She will now face all the scrutiny that comes with a rising campaign. But it was the political instincts she showed in turning to Biden and challenging his past positions on race that will mean this debate may be remembered for years to come. She rebuked Biden for his recent comments about segregationist senators and said she had been personally hurt by his position on integrating schools in the 1970s. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d Biden, monetarily stunned, protested, rightly that he had a strong record on civil rights - and said local authorities, not Washington, where he was serving as a senator, took decisions that affected Harris. As she tried to cross-examine him, Biden threw a jab of his own saying, \u201cI was a public defender. I didn\u2019t become a prosecutor,\u201d in a reference to Harris\u2019s former job sending people to jail. \u201cI\u2019ve also argued very strongly that we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box,\u201d Biden added. \u201cI agree that everybody once they \u2013 anyway, my time is up. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Biden said, trailing off. Harris was not the only candidate to try to grab a headline by attacking Biden and emphasizing the generational gap. Swalwell said in a CNN interview earlier Thursday that Biden\u2019s ideas were \u201cstaler than Donald Trump\u2019s.\u201d And on the debate stage, he added, \u201cI was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic convention and said it\u2019s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. That candidate was then-Sen. Joe Biden.\u201d \u201cHe was right when he said that 32 years ago. He is still right today.\u201d Biden didn\u2019t seem too put off by his 38-year-old colleague\u2019s impudence, replying \u201cI\u2019m holding onto that torch. I want to make that clear,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Thursday night established a commanding presence on her party\u2019s debate stage \u2013 cutting through the cacophony of her rivals and insisting time and again that the candidates turn their attention to the troubles of \u201creal Americans.\u201d  Harris\u2019 surefooted and forceful debate performance, after languishing in single digits in the polls, appears likely to cement her role in the top-tier of candidates vying to take on President Donald Trump in the general election. In one of the sharpest exchanges of the night, the former prosecutor took direct aim at the Democratic field\u2019s frontrunner \u2013 confronting former Vice President Joe Biden over his 1970s-era opposition to the federal government\u2019s role in using school busing to integrate schools while highlighting her personal story as small child who benefited from early busing in Berkeley, California. Kamala Harris touts prosecutor past as a strength: 'I know how to take on predators' Biden bristled as Harris repeatedly pressed him on his decades-old position. \u201cVice President Biden, do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?\u201d she asked, turning to face him. \u201cNo\u201d a testy Biden responded. Biden said he did not oppose \u201cbusing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That\u2019s what I opposed.\u201d The exchange with Biden demonstrated Harris\u2019 courtroom-sharpened skills \u2013 her campaign\u2019s frequent refrain is that she\u2019s in the best position to \u201cprosecute the case\u201d against Trump. But it also served to underscore the racial and generational divide between the two. On the debate stage and in a post-debate interview with CNN, Harris emphasized the personal toll of anti-school busing policies. \u201cThe policy perspective that was opposed to busing had real consequence,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cI was that little girl. And there are many others around the country who were those little girls and boys.\u201d Even before the Biden-Harris confrontation, the political world had begun cheering Harris on as she cut through the noise on the crowded debate stage to calmly convey her positions. \u201cKamala Harris\u2019 campaign manager is on the phone right now with the DNC proposing more debates,\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and the co-host of Pod Save America, tweeted. \u201cKamala Harris is capturing the heart and soul of the Democratic Party,\u201d Republican pollster Frank Luntz tweeted early on. Later, he added: \u201cIn just about every way imaginable, Kamala Harris dominated. She had the guts to take on and embarrass Joe Biden \u2013 not only did she have the best language, she was the most memorable.\u201d In one breakout moment early in the debate, the California senator held up her hands as her rivals talked over one another and the moderator to say: \u201cGuys, you know what? American does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we\u2019re going to put food on their table.\u201d The crowd erupted in applause. Minutes later, she evoked the anguish of parents of a fevered child, sitting outside an emergency room and weighing whether they could afford to pay a $5,000 deductible the treatment would bring. The crowd erupted again. Harris, the only African-American candidate on Thursday night\u2019s stage and one of a record six women running for the presidency, didn\u2019t shy away from reminding voters of her biography and how that had shaped her world view. \u201cThere is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of profiling or discrimination,\u201d Harris said during her pointed exchange with Biden. \u201cMy sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn\u2019t play with us because we were black,\u201d she added. After the debate, Harris\u2019 fundraising boomed, an aide told CNN. The campaign, the aide said, raised more money on Thursday than any day of the campaign other than Harris\u2019 launch day and the day after the launch.

            "article_content": "Democratic voters tuned into Thursday night\u2019s debate searching for the candidate who could take down Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 and many flipped on their television sets expecting that person to be front-runner Joe Biden.  In a surprise twist, it was former prosecutor Kamala Harris who took command of the debate stage, outshining her rivals time after time with succinct and fiery denunciations of the Trump administration\u2019s policies on everything from the treatment of migrant children to the gaping income equality in this country\u2014and even setting the tone early in the debate by reminding her colleagues that Americans don\u2019t want a \u201cfood fight,\u201d they want to know Democrats are \u201cgoing to put food on the table.\u201d The drama of that exchange overshadowed the two-hour debate that encapsulated a broad array of policy debates, and a clear divide on the stage between candidates like Sanders and Warren who want to see the party veer in a more leftist direction with \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d and the disappearance of private health insurance, and more moderate candidates like former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet who worry that the Democrats\u2019 shift to left will endanger the parties chances of retaking the White House. But it was the spell-binding moment when she challenged Joe Biden over his invocation of working with former colleagues who were segregationists and his record on busing that will be replayed hundreds of times. With a withering series of questions and an emotional allusion to the fact that she was one of those little girls who rode those buses, Harris went a long way toward proving to Democratic voters that she can \u2013 as she often tells audiences \u2013 fiercely prosecute the case against Trump. In this case, Biden was her foil. Leaning heavily on the skills that made her so effective both as a prosecutor and as an interrogator of Trump nominees in Senate hearings over the past few years, she began quietly by alluding to the controversy that Biden stirred last week at a fundraiser when he noted that he had worked with segregationist senators in the 1970s and 1980s during what he framed as a less polarizing, more civil time in politics. \u201cVice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you, when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut I also believe \u2013 and it\u2019s personal \u2013 it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d As Biden stared straight ahead, looking somewhat pained, Harris continued by criticizing the former vice president for trying to prevent the Department of Education from enforcing school busing to integrate schools during the 1970s, invoking her own experience to make the point. \u201cThat little girl was me,\u201d Harris said with emotion swelling in her voice. \u201cSo I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.\u201d His voice rising, Biden attempted to strike back, calling Harris\u2019 remarks a \u201cmischaracterization of my position across the board.\u201d \u201cI did not oppose busing in America,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cWhat I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education, that\u2019s what I opposed.\u201d Harris brushed off Biden\u2019s argument for local control, arguing the federal government must step in to keep civil rights from being violated \u201cbecause there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.\u201d The moment dealt the front-runner a serious setback that is likely to lead more than a few voters to question whether he is the best-equipped candidate to take on the current occupant of the White House. Biden eventually seemed to concede the exchange after attempting to list a long litany of civil and equal rights causes that he had championed, simply saying, \u201cMy time is up.\u201d Despite strong answers out of the gate about income inequality in America and Trump\u2019s economic policies that that favor the wealthiest Americans, Biden and Sanders, at times, seem to recede on the stage as Harris and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg delivered composed, thoughtful and emotionally charged answers that have resonated with Democrats who are seeking a fresh generation of leadership. One of the most striking answers from Buttigieg was about his frustration that he has not been able to do more to diversify the police force and soothe the racial tensions that flared after a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. When asked about the lack of diversity in the police force, Buttigieg answered frankly: \u201cI couldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d He acknowledged that situation has been complicated by the fact that the officer didn\u2019t have his body camera turned on. \u201cWe are hurting. I could walk you through all of the things we have done as a community,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAll of the steps we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn\u2019t save the life of Eric Logan. When I look into his mother\u2019s eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back.\u201d Buttigieg said he was determined \u201cto bring about a day\u201d when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle experiences the same feeling when a police officer approaches: \u201cNot of fear, but of safety.\u201d Many candidates looked to score points on Biden, none more so than California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who is barely registering in the polls, who took a direct jab at Biden\u2019s age. \u201cI was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said it\u2019s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cThat candidate was then-Sen. Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He is still right today.\u201d With a grin, Biden responded by saying \u201cI\u2019m still holding on to that torch,\u201d and then quickly moving on to his education plans, including focusing on schools in distress and tripling federal funding for Title I schools.\u201d The debate, the second of two back to back match-ups among 10 candidates on NBC in Miami, was the first test for the former vice president since he left government in January 2017, and he aimed to show that he has the kind of message discipline that has been lacking in some of the bumpier parts of his career in politics. In addition to Sanders, Harris, Buttigieg and Swalwell, the former vice President shared the stage on Thursday night with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Bennet, Hickenlooper, businessman Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson, who all met the threshold set by the Democratic National Committee. Sanders unapologetically advocated for his plan for Medicare-for-All and made no excuses for the fact that taxes for the middle class would go up under his plans while arguing their health care costs would go down. \u201cWe have a new vision for America,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAt a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America while 500,000 people are sleeping on the streets today. We think it is time for change.\u201d It was a moment early in the debate that was firmly on Sanders\u2019 ground, as many candidates were left attempting to answer questions about his signature health insurance policies. Biden made an argument that may go over better with the moderates and independents he plans to target in the general election - stating that he would force major change in the economic system by reversing Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts. \u201cDonald Trump thinks Wall Street built America; ordinary middle class Americans built America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToo many people in the middle class have seen the bottom fall out.\u201d Harris took that opening early in the debate to weigh in with the core argument of her candidacy: \u201cWorking families need support and need to be lifted up and frankly, this economy is not working for working people,\u201d she said. Several of the lower tier candidates, however, challenged Sanders and his ideas \u2013 arguing that they would be too far out of the comfort zone of average Americans in a General Election After one of the moderators noted that Sanders identifies as a Democratic socialist, Hickenlooper warned that the specter of socialism would give Republicans an opening to \u201ccome at us every way they can.\u201d Bennet said that while he agreed with Sanders about the importance of addressing income inequality: \u201cWhere I disagree is on his solution of Medicare-for-All,\u201d he said. Bennet proposed a slower approach toward achieving universal health care. But Sanders defended his potential to take on Trump by citing the latest head-to-head matchups with the President as proof of his electability. Some of the most unusual moments of the night came in the answers from Williamson, an author and spiritual adviser. At one point when the candidates were asked to name the first thing they would do in office, Williamson replied: \u201cMy first call is to the prime minister of New Zealand, who said that her goal is to make New Zealand the place where it\u2019s the best place in the world for a child to grow up. And I would tell her, \u2018Girlfriend, you are so wrong, because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.\u2019 \u201c Williamson\u2019s closing argument took on the same other-worldly quality. She said she was sorry that the candidates hadn\u2019t talked more about how they were going to beat Donald Trump \u2013 even though that was one of the major themes of the debate. \u201cI have an idea about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk. He\u2019s not going to be beaten just somebody who has plans. He\u2019s going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea what this man has done,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThis man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he has harnessed fear for political purposes. So, Mr. President, if you\u2019re listening, I want you to hear me, please. You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out.\u201d \u201cSo I, sir, I have a feeling you know what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field. And, sir, love will win.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated to more clearly state the context surrounding Harris\u2019 criticism of Biden.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story, which was originally published as Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential campaign in April, has been updated after his remarks this week about working with segregationist senators decades ago. The dust-up this week over Joe Biden\u2019s praise of his working relationship with segregationist Democratic senators sharply underlines how his presidential candidacy is forcing a reckoning between the Democratic Party of today and the party of 50 years ago. When Biden, who\u2019s now 76, was first elected to the Senate from Delaware in 1972, Democrats relied on an electoral coalition that revolved primarily around working-class white voters, many of them conservative on cultural issues, particularly those involving race. With those voters in sight, Biden was one of many generally liberal Democrats during that era who took nuanced, or even openly conservative, positions on racially infused issues, including school busing and crime. Biden now will force Democrats to decide whether those earlier views are still acceptable in a party that has moved left since then on all racially related issues, in response both to shifting attitudes in the country and the increasing diversity of its voters. \u201cHis career is really a microcosm of the changes in the Democratic Party over the past half-century, all in one person,\u201d says Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and longtime Democratic policy analyst. The Democratic electorate is older, more moderate and less educated than you think The electoral landscape that confronted Democrats of Biden\u2019s generation is almost unimaginable for today\u2019s younger party activists. Biden, a lawyer, began his political career in 1970 by winning a seat on the county council of New Castle, Delaware, which included Wilmington, the state\u2019s largest city. Two years later, he won election to the US Senate, just weeks before his 30th birthday. He served in the Senate for the next 36 years, until he joined President Barack Obama as his vice president in 2009. Decades of change have reshaped the party not only demographically but also geographically. When Biden first arrived in 1973, the sustained Democratic majorities in Congress still depended partly on their dominance of House and Senate seats across the South. During Biden\u2019s first session in the Senate, Democrats held about two-thirds of both the House and Senate seats from the region. Southern Democrats, many of them still staunch conservatives who had resisted civil rights \u2013 like Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia, each of whom Biden has cited as figures he was able to work with \u2013 accounted for one-fourth of the Democratic Senate caucus and nearly one-third of all Democrats in the House, according to the Brookings Institution\u2019s Vital Statistics on Congress. Even in Biden\u2019s era that meant it was impossible for more liberal Democrats to avoid working with the Southerners because the party only rarely had enough votes to pass its agenda if its Southern wing preponderantly voted with Republicans. Over the span of Biden\u2019s career, the country \u2013 and the Democratic coalition \u2013 experienced enormous demographic change. In the 1976 election, when Democrat Jimmy Carter won the presidency, whites without college degrees composed 70% of all voters, according to an analysis of census data by the nonpartisan States of Change project. Minority voters \u2013 almost all of them African-American \u2013 made up only about 11% of voters then, with college-educated whites providing the remaining 19%. Even as late as 1992, when President Bill Clinton was first elected, those blue-collar whites still represented about 60% of all voters, with college whites composing about 25% and minorities the remaining 15%. According to the States of Change calculations, working-class white voters cast a majority of the votes in every presidential election until 2008 (when they represented 48% of the voters). African-American voters were already reliable Democrats by the 1970s, having moved decisively toward the party after the passage of the landmark civil rights laws in the 1960s. But white-collar whites in that period still leaned heavily toward the Republican Party: During the three presidential elections of the 1980s, Presidents Ronald Reagan and then George H.W. Bush carried college-educated whites by at least 20 percentage points each time. How Joe Biden worked with and praised a longtime opponent of civil rights The result that Democrats in almost every state \u2013 and certainly in presidential elections \u2013 relied on an electoral coalition centered primarily on whites without college degrees and secondarily on African-Americans. In 1980, for instance, fully 60% of Carter\u2019s votes in his losing race against Reagan came from working-class whites, according to calculations by longtime Democratic elections analyst Ruy Teixeira, one of the founders of the States of Change project. \u201cThat\u2019s a world that is gone, and it is easy for people to forget how different things were back then, both in terms of voting behavior and relative size of the groups,\u201d says Teixeira, co-author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Forgotten Majority,\u201d a 2000 book about the white working class. By 2016, blue-collar whites, in stark contrast, accounted for slightly less than 30% of the votes that Hillary Clinton won. That was partly because the group continued its long-term decline as a share of the total vote (reaching 44% by the States of Change calculations), but also because it broke so decisively toward Donald Trump. Minorities, including growing populations of Hispanics and Asian-Americans, provided about 40% of Clinton\u2019s votes, while whites with college degrees, among whom Democrats have gained strength steadily since the 1990s, contributed the remaining 30% or so. Younger Democrats reared in a political world where the party mobilized that latter coalition, and built its congressional majorities despite Republican control of most Southern seats, have little experience with the choices the party faced in the 1970s and 1980s. The principal electoral challenge facing Democrats during the first decades of Biden\u2019s career was crafting an agenda and message that could unite working-class whites and African-Americans. \u201cIt was the central issue,\u201d said Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg, who became nationally known from his studies of white working-class alienation from the Democratic Party in Macomb County, Michigan, after the 1984 election. \u201cJimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, were seen as very responsive to African-American voters in their time, yet they were also candidates who stretched to reach white working-class voters. You could not contemplate being successful and sustainable as a national party through Bill Clinton without making an imperative of (attracting) very strong support with both those groups.\u201d Issues relating to racial equity were always the most vulnerable link in this chain. The Democratic reliance on white working-class voters in those years meant that their coalition included a significant number of whites who held conservative positions on race-related issues and even many with antagonistic views toward African-Americans. In the University of Michigan\u2019s National Election Studies, a comprehensive post-election survey, at least 70% of self-identified Democrats opposed busing to achieve school integration in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984. Even as late as 1994, in polling by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, fully 59% of all white Democrats, and 63% of white Democrats without college degrees, rejected discrimination as the principal cause of inequality and said instead that \u201cBlacks who can\u2019t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition.\u201d In Pew\u2019s most recent polling, just 25% of all white Democrats, and 33% of them without college degrees, endorsed that view. The party \u201chad a significant number of very conservative, racially conservative, probably racist, Democrats in their coalition,\u201d said Greenberg. \u201cThere was no other way to imagine it. That was your electorate. That was your state, that was your citizenry.\u201d Delaware, a state with a large blue-collar white population, embodied the tensions in the Democratic coalition. In 1970, the year Biden first held elected office there, census figures showed that 84% of the state was white, and just 14% of white adults held college degrees. For Biden, like most northern Democrats in those years, there was no path to electoral success that did not include a competitive performance among non-college white voters: If he allowed his deficit with them to grow too large, there were simply not enough other voters to overcome it. With that electoral challenge as the backdrop, Biden followed a careful path on race-related issues throughout his long Senate career. Civil rights groups generally considered him an ally and praised his record on housing rights, voting rights, the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and his work as Judiciary Committee chair to win Senate ratification in 1994 for an international conventional on ending racial discrimination, fully 28 years after the US signed it. Joe Biden's handling of Anita Hill hearing re-emerges with latest controversy But Biden also regularly frustrated civil rights activists. He \u201cwas a mixed bag,\u201d said one leading civil rights lobbyist during those years, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about Biden\u2019s record. \u201cHe was certainly in the Democratic Party mainstream but he was to the right of center on some of the social justice issues of the times. He was always a supporter of voting rights; he was always a supporter of housing. He wasn\u2019t John Stennis\u201d \u2013 the segregationist Democratic senator from Mississippi \u2013 \u201che wasn\u2019t a conservative Democrat or Republican. But he did have some issues where he was right of center. I think Joe has evolved. I don\u2019t think there was any question about that.\u201d One of the most volatile racial issues Biden has had to confront is the one that intersects with gender: his handling of Anita Hill\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment against Republican Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. But two other policies that embody shifting Democratic sentiment will also provoke extensive debate. One was Biden\u2019s prominent role in the 1970s promoting legislation to limit the use of school busing to combat racial segregation. He wasn\u2019t alone in that: Dozens of House Democrats, for instance, routinely voted for legislation to limit busing. But as historian Jason Sokol chronicled in his 2014 book \u201cAll Eyes Are Upon Us, Race and Politics from Boston to Brooklyn,\u201d Biden was a leader in Senate efforts against busing, working arm in arm with archconservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina well into the 1980s. \u201cWhat Biden did is he made anti-busing more politically respectable,\u201d said Sokol, an associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. Although busing was usually the only practical means to achieve school integration, Sokol says, \u201cBiden claimed he was pro-integration but anti-busing, which was disingenuous, but that was the position a lot of (Democrats) were looking for.\u201d Two decades later, Biden was a principal author of the crime bill that passed under Bill Clinton. A complex balancing act between liberal and conservative priorities, the bill provoked withering criticism at the time from conservatives, but in recent years it has faced unmitigated hostility from liberals and civil rights advocates who see it as a wellspring of mass incarceration. Many centrist Democrats say Biden\u2019s choices on these issues are defensible on substantive grounds. When Congress passed and Clinton signed the crime bill, for instance, the violent crime rate was nearly double its level today, according to FBI figures, and most African-American mayors and members of Congress supported the legislation. And busing was always deeply controversial, with polls showing whites overwhelmingly opposed and even African-Americans closely divided over the policy. \u201cCould opposition to busing be defended in the context of the times?\u201d asked Galston, who served as Walter Mondale\u2019s issues director in the 1984 presidential campaign and Clinton\u2019s deputy domestic policy adviser. \u201cYes, definitely. Because it was a policy which was typically, though not invariably, judicially enforced that lacked public authorization or buy-in, and that rested on certain premises about what equal educational opportunity amounted to that were eminently questionable.\u201d The larger issue is not whether Biden can muster explanations for each of the positions he took on racially tinged debates decades ago. The real question may be whether a party that has moved to a very different consensus on those issues is better served by a nominee who ever held those views, whatever the justification, or one whose agenda and message have always reflected its modern racial perspective. Joe Biden's long path to woke 2020 Teixeira says it would be a mistake for Democrats to \u201cwrite off\u201d older white politicians \u2013 and by implication older white voters \u2013 from Biden\u2019s generation. \u201cIt is just off to take people out of their historical context and judge them by the same norms we have today. It doesn\u2019t help to understand who they are and what they did when they did it,\u201d he says. \u201cPoliticians say stuff not just because that\u2019s what they believe at the time, it\u2019s because they are embedded in a certain political context in which they are trying to put together 50+1 (of the vote). And they have to be sensitive to the views of their constituency.\u201d Steve Phillips, author of the 2016 book \u201cBrown Is the New White\u201d and an advocate for increased Democratic focus on mobilizing nonwhite voters, doesn\u2019t entirely disagree. But he worries that Biden remains too focused on mollifying the blue-collar white voters whose conservative racial views shaped his formative political years. \u201cHe obviously said very troubling, outright disqualifying things, particularly during the busing days, given where the party and the country is at today,\u201d said Phillips, who is supporting Cory Booker in 2020. \u201cBut you need to allow the potential for him to have grown and evolved. The concern is that the premise of his candidacy is his capacity to win over those conservative white working-class voters who still hold those views. That\u2019s what is going to be the difficult needle to thread. Does he think his personality alone will attract them or will it be the issue set?\u201d On the other hand, even some veteran civil rights leaders frustrated with aspects of Biden\u2019s record still consider him the party\u2019s strongest potential nominee in 2020, precisely because he seems the best suited to win back the three Rust Belt states that Trump dislodged from the \u201cblue wall\u201d in 2016: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Early polling has found a stark generational divide in attitudes toward Biden, with the former vice president generating much more support among older Democratic voters than younger ones. The debate over his posture on race \u2013 which encapsulates the often wrenching evolution of the Democratic Party itself through his career \u2013 seems likely to harden that divide. Biden inflamed the issue by initially seeming to celebrate his ability to work with his segregationist colleagues in the earlier era, rather than presenting it as an inescapable necessity of the times. He\u2019s since tried to stress his willingness to oppose them on issues such as the Voting Rights Act. But whatever lens he uses to look back, Biden\u2019s candidacy may measure the tolerance of younger Democrats for the choices that their elders made to navigate a very different demographic and political era.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden can\u2019t seem to get out of his own way. His campaign started the day by defending his nostalgia for a more civil Washington \u2013 when getting things done meant working with segregationists on occasion. His comments at a campaign fundraiser in New York Tuesday night drew swift rebukes from his Democratic rivals for president, drawing the controversy into the next news cycle. The backlash Biden faces from his rivals is less about his record on race \u2013 he has long fought for racial equality \u2013 and far more about whether he truly appreciates the changes that have taken place in his own party during a career that began in the early 1970s. Biden harkened back to a time when even segregationist lawmakers were acceptable in polite company, but he is aiming for the White House at a time when such historic figures are viewed as abhorrent. The 76-year-old former vice president is taking the focus off his own contribution to history as the vice president of the first US African American president. Instead, his crusade to restore civility to America\u2019s tortured political life is exemplified by his past relationship with two segregationist senators. Biden defends comments about segregationist senators: 'There's not a racist bone in my body' The controversy bolstered suggestions that some of the views and sensibilities that are the legacy of Biden\u2019s near half-century-long political career are out of step with the modern Democratic Party. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s faced such challenges. Earlier this month Biden reversed his position on the federal funding of abortion, and he\u2019s had to change his style on the stump after some women said his tactile manner made them uncomfortable. Biden\u2019s leading Democratic rivals were quick to exploit his stumble Wednesday as they sought to turn his years of experience into a liability rather than the core of his argument that no man has ever been better prepared to be president. It was also a chance for them to pull Biden, who has tried to hover above the sharp elbows of the race as front-runner, more directly into the fray. Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders waded into a backlash triggered by another Democratic presidential hopeful, Sen. Cory Booker, who was quick to spot an opening for a campaign that has struggled to get coverage. \u201cVice President Biden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone,\u201d Booker said, and called on Biden to apologize. But the Democratic front-runner \u2013 who has been at the vanguard of his party\u2019s evolution on some issues, like same-sex marriage \u2013 reacted defiantly to the New Jersey senator\u2019s demand. Asked by CNN whether he should say he was sorry, he said: \u201cApologize for what?\u201d before adding, \u201cCory should apologize.\u201d \u201cHe knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in civil rights my whole career,\u201d Biden added. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon later on Wednesday night, Booker said, \u201cI know that I was raised to speak truth to power, and I will never apologize for doing that, and Vice President Biden shouldn\u2019t need this lesson.\u201d The question, however, is less about Biden\u2019s record on race than whether he has truly appreciated the changes that have taken place in his party during a career that began in the early 1970s, when even segregationist lawmakers were acceptable in polite company, and could culminate at the White House at a time when such historic figures are viewed as abhorrent. Biden\u2019s remarks, at a fundraiser on Tuesday night, came amid increasing scrutiny over the staying power of his early polling lead. They were a gift to his rivals as the race kicks into high gear before next week\u2019s first Democratic debates. And they suggest that Biden may not have completely purged a historic propensity for self-inflicted political wounds that has stayed mostly dormant in a tightly controlled campaign rollout. Apart from the political malpractice suggested by Biden\u2019s comments, the analogy struck a shocking tone \u2013 especially since he had used President Donald Trump\u2019s equivocation over racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, to lay a foundation stone for his campaign. Biden\u2019s reference to Democratic Sens. Herman Talmadge of Georgia and James Eastland of Mississippi came across as especially questionable since both were staunch opponents of civil rights. \u201cI was in a caucus with James O. Eastland. He never called me \u2018boy,\u2019 he always called me \u2018son,\u2019 \u201d Biden told donors on Tuesday night. \u201cWell, guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished.\u201d As the controversy escalated on Wednesday evening, Biden portrayed himself as fighting to counter the old Senate guard alongside liberal icon Sen. Edward Kennedy. \u201cWe had to put up with the likes of like Jim Eastland and Hermy Talmadge and all those segregationists and all of that. And the fact of the matter is that we were able to do it because we were able to win \u2013 we were able to beat them on everything they stood for,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser in Maryland. None of Biden\u2019s fellow candidates suggested that he shared the late senators\u2019 views. And his comments are unlikely on their own to permanently damage his White House hopes. But the controversy was a reminder of the intense daily pressure exerted by a presidential campaign and the extra scrutiny paid to every word Biden utters, owing to his front-runner status. Biden\u2019s defenders argue that he was in no way endorsing the views of the old, racist Senate bulls but making a point that the American political system requires compromise even with rivals whose views you may deem abhorrent in order for progress to be made. But apart from jarring with the modern outlook of a party that now prizes diversity after a racially scarred past, the remarks gave a future opening to Trump at a time when many Democrats accuse the President of giving comfort to white supremacists. It was not the first time Biden had overlooked a colleague\u2019s racist past. In 2003, he spoke at the memorial service for former Sen. Strom Thurmond, who ran for president in 1948 on an anti-civil-rights platform. More fundamentally, the controversy threatens to undermine two of the pillars on which Biden is basing his campaign. The first is that Democratic voters are less swept up in a tide of young, diverse, radical left-wing activism than many analysts and young stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez think and will, therefore, embrace a more moderate nominee. But reaching back across the decades to obscure political figures seems to be taking that contention to ridiculous lengths. Eastland, for instance, first served in the Senate in 1941, before the US entered World War II. The comment adds to a picture of Biden as a remnant of a back-slapping past in the smoke-filled, male-dominated Senate cloakrooms rather than a dynamic figure fit to lead America into the third decade of the 21st century. Biden has already had to explain that he now wishes he had done more as the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman to shield Anita Hill, who got a rough reception while leveling charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. And CNN reported in April about Biden\u2019s opposition to court-ordered busing to desegregate public schools in the 1970s. Ensuring a heavy turnout of African American voters is at the center of Biden\u2019s campaign for the Democratic nomination and any general election duel against Trump. He has made huge play of his service alongside the nation\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama. Biden also insists that voters are looking for a unifying candidate who can bring back the less noxious times before the Trump presidency and want their politicians to work with each other despite disagreements  \u2013 a point his disastrous analogy was supposed to make. \u201cToday, you look at the other side and you\u2019re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don\u2019t talk to each other anymore,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Fact check: Trump's Orlando rally featured more than 15 false claims over 76 minutes In the past, Biden has worked with Republican senators to pass legislation, including the Violence Against Women Act. In the Obama administration the then-vice president used his friendship with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in budget negotiations. But many Biden critics believe he has a rose-tinted recollection of his Senate days and that the vicious polarization of Trump-era politics means there would be no return to civility even if the front-running Democrat wins the White House. Many Democrats are still fuming at McConnell\u2019s attempts to thwart Obama\u2019s presidency and his refusal to confirm the 44th President\u2019s last Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. The Biden campaign tried to douse the controversy by putting adviser Anita Dunn on MSNBC. She argued that the \u201cpoint of his story is that you have to be able to work with people even if they hold positions repugnant to you in order to make some progress.\u201d \u201cAs he says in the story, that he didn\u2019t agree with them, and he absolutely did not agree, but they were able to disagree and there was civility involved,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t praise them. He didn\u2019t praise their positions. He certainly didn\u2019t endorse their positions.\u201d But a person close to Biden told CNN that the former Delaware senator had been advised to steer clear of reminiscing about Eastland and Talmadge. \u201cHe needs to use a new, less problematic example,\u201d the person said. Some of Biden\u2019s friends from his long life in Washington defended him. \u201cI worked with Strom Thurmond all my life,\u201d House Majority Whip James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who\u2019s the top ranked African American legislator, was quoted as saying by Politico. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with people to work with them.\u201d But Warren, who has risen to second place in some Democratic polls, said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize other Democrats, but it\u2019s never OK to celebrate segregationists. Never.\u201d Harris slipped in a political knife despite praising Biden\u2019s \u201cnoble\u201d service to the nation. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear that the senators that he is speaking up with such adoration are individuals who made and built their reputation on segregation,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "In a victory for Democrats in Virginia, the Supreme Court held Monday that the Republican-led Virginia House of Delegates did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck several district maps they had drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. This means court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used. The decision will have an immediate impact on Virginia\u2019s fall legislative elections at a crucial time. The state, once reliably Republican, has slowly drifted left. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate and House by slim margins. This fall, every state legislative seat is up for re-election and the GOP holds only a two-seat advantage in both chambers. Had the court ruled in favor of the Republican challenge, it would\u2019ve greatly improved their chances of holding on to the House of Delegates. Twenty-six House districts were re-aligned by an outside expert after a lower court ruled 11 districts unconstitutional. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion for a 5-4 court, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. Because the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge on standing grounds, justices did not rule if the maps constitute an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Supreme Court takes on racial gerrymander claim in Virginia \u201cOne House of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process,\u201d Ginsburg wrote. \u201cIf the State had designated the House to represent its interests, and if the House had in fact carried out that mission, we would agree that the House could stand in for the State. Neither precondition, however, is met here.\u201d In a statement released on Monday, the Speaker of the House of Delegates Kirk Cox, who brought the suit, vowed that the redistricting battle is not over. \u201cUnfortunately, the Court\u2019s decision to not decide the merits of this case leaves a number of unanswered questions just two years before the next redistricting cycle,\u201d said Cox. \u201cThis could have been prevented if Attorney General (Mark) Herring would have defended the law of the Commonwealth and allowed the court to provide an opinion on the merits of this case.\u201d Herring declined to defend the re-drawn districts when they were challenged in court. In a tweet posted Monday, Herring lauded the decision by the high court. \u201cThe US Supreme Court has rejected Virginia Republicans\u2019 efforts to protect racially gerrymandered districts. Virginia\u2019s elections this fall will take place in fair, constitutional districts. It\u2019s a good day for democracy in Virginia,\u201d Herring wrote. Former US Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization whose goal is to end Republican gerrymandering, said in a statement on Monday that the Court\u2019s decision \u201cis an important victory for African Americans in Virginia who have been forced since 2011 to vote in racially gerrymandered districts that unfairly diluted their voting power.\u201d \u201cWith a new, fair map in place, all Virginians will now \u2013 finally \u2013 have the opportunity this fall to elect a House of Delegates that actually represents the will of the people,\u201d Holder said. Beyond the immediate impact of this fall\u2019s elections, the decision could have a far reaching implication on Virginia politics. If Democrats flip either or both chambers this fall, they will be well positioned to control the next round of redistricting after the 2020 census.

            "article_content": "Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, yet has not had a single African American win state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction. A new lawsuit alleges that one of the reasons is a set of provisions in the Mississippi Constitution that \u201cdilutes\u201d the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. The lawsuit, filed last week by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accused the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. It called on the court to pull the provisions ahead of the state\u2019s next elections. \u201cAbsent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\u201d the complaint submitted last week to a federal court in Mississippi read. CNN has reached out to Hosemann. Meg Annison, a spokeswoman for Gunn, said Wednesday morning that he had \u201cnot been served with the complaint yet.\u201d The voters in the suit are represented by a pair of Mississippi attorneys along with a group of Washington lawyers. The National Redistricting Foundation, an affiliate of an anti-gerrymandering group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, said it is supporting the suit. \u201cMississippi\u2019s long, sordid history of racial discrimination and politicians who exploit racial divisions only perpetuate this broken system in which African-American interests are woefully underrepresented in the state government,\u201d Holder said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to level the playing field so that African-American voters are finally able to exercise their right to elect the candidates of their choice to lead Mississippi.\u201d In Mississippi, the winners of state-level, statewide offices must win both an outright majority of the popular vote and a majority of state House districts. If no candidate wins both indicators, the state House determines the election. The lawsuit argued that the process was set up to \u201centrench white control\u201d of the state and makes it harder for African Americans to win statewide races. Mississippi\u2019s 1999 gubernatorial race ended without either major-party candidate receiving the requisite majority of votes statewide, and according to an article from The New York Times the following January, the Mississippi House voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate, the first time a governor\u2019s race was turned to the House. The provision requiring that a candidate win a majority of state House districts increases white control because \u201cthe vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\u201d the complaint said. The suit said the distribution of voters by race through state House districts means a candidate preferred by white voters can win the majority of districts with a much lower share of the overall vote than a candidate preferred by African Americans. It described the provision turning over the election to the state House as a \u201cfailsafe\u201d for whites in the state. The lawsuit sets out the historic context of Mississippi\u2019s 1890 Constitution, \u201cratified in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction\u201d and setting up a process \u201cthat intentionally and effectively dilutes African-American voting strength in all such elections.\u201d The lawsuit also noted the 1890 Constitution included a range of racist measures synonymous with the Jim Crow era, including the infamous and since-repealed poll tax. \u201cThe framers of the 1890 Constitution made no secret of their intentions,\u201d the complaint read. \u201cThe challenged provisions are the result of a blatant, well-publicized campaign to minimize the political influence of African-Americans in Mississippi.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court is entering the final rounds of a term featuring a newly solidified conservative majority that has faced off at times against the four liberal justices and seen some dramatic moments. So far, Chief Justice John Roberts has bobbed and weaved, balancing his institutional concerns against his own solidly conservative leanings. Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court in the early part of the 2018-19 term after a contentious nomination hearing featuring allegations of sexual misconduct as a teenager (he has denied the allegations). Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had two cancerous nodules removed from her left lung in December. There have been some opinions that resemble compromises. Neither Elena Kagan nor Stephen Breyer publicly dissented when the court issued an unsigned opinion allowing one provision of an Indiana law go into effect that mandated the burial or cremation of fetal remains. On the same day, the justices left in place a lower court ruling that invalidated a much more restrictive abortion related provision of the same law. Justice Clarence Thomas, kept up the pressure from the right side of the bench reminding his colleagues of his view that \u201cthe Constitution itself is silent on abortion.\u201d The justices have met week after week and extended courtesies on the bench such as Thomas silently offering a hand to Ginsburg as she leaves the courtroom, but they\u2019ve also feuded late into the night on death penalty petitions. As the term ends the country will see where they stand on a citizenship question on the 2020 census, as well as the issue of extreme partisan gerrymandering. And all eyes will look to next term \u2013 held in the heat of the election\u2014to see which cases the court will decide to hear. Here\u2019s a look at the key remaining opinions: The Supreme Court is wading into a bitter controversy over whether the Trump administration can ask all recipients a citizenship question on the 2020 census for the first time since 1950. Democrats look at packing the Supreme Court to pack the vote The administration claims that the question is necessary to better comply with federal voting rights law, while critics say it represents a veiled attempt to intimidate noncitizens and Hispanic households and will lead to a decrease in response rates. Every lower court to consider the issue has so far blocked the administration from adding a question about citizenship status to the census questionnaire, holding that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has jurisdiction, exceeded his authority under federal law or the Constitution by doing so. After arguments, the challengers informed the court they had obtained \u201cnew evidence\u201d that the decision was politically motivated. Why it matters: With the 2020 census fast approaching, how the justices rule in this case about political representation could impact the critical data derived from the census, which is used for issues such as the allocation of congressional seats and the distribution of billions of federal dollars to states and localities over the next decade. RELATED: John Roberts faces another test with census case The court is considering when politicians go too far in drawing lines for partisan gain, in a set of cases arising from North Carolina and Maryland that could fundamentally impact the balance of power in legislatures and Congress. Similar cases out of Ohio and Michigan have been put on hold pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Although the court has a standard to weed out extreme racial gerrymanders, it has never been able to settle on a standard for partisan gerrymandering. With the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, critics of extreme partisan gerrymandering fear they may have lost the last chance at a meaningful test. They say that with sophisticated new redistricting technology, map drawers are able to manipulate the system more than ever, and entrench the governing party in power. States argue that there is no manageable standard and that the Constitution gives them broad authority to regulate redistricting. Ruth Bader Ginsburg speaks out with eye towards future of Roe v. Wade The North Carolina case is brought by Democrats challenging Republican-drawn districts, the Maryland case is Republicans challenging a Democratic district. The lower courts struck the districts and provided the justices with several potential tests grounded in the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause and other parts of the Constitution to establish a new standard. Why it matters: On the eve of the next census, this case could change how maps are drawn. The justices could, for the first time, establish a test to determine when partisan motivation is too much, or they could slam the door shut on such claims, holding that it is an issue better left to the political branches of government. The court is looking at 11 districts drawn by the Republican-led legislature in Virginia in 2011 that were struck down as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander by the lower court. Registered voters in each district challenged the maps and prevailed below when a lower court held that they had \u201cshown through telling direct and circumstantial evidence that race predominated over traditional districting factors.\u201d Lawyers for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates are seeking to represent the state over the objections of the Democratic governor and attorney general and they are asking the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court. They say the maps were drawn to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Watching for the Supreme Court to set the terms for the eventual Roe v. Wade showdown Two questions are before the justices: Does the House of Delegates have the legal right, or \u201cstanding\u201d to bring the challenge, and should the districts be struck down as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Why it matters: These districts will only be used for the off year election and 2020, whoever wins will draw the new districts after the next census. The American Legion built the so-called \u201cPeace Cross\u201d in 1925 to honor 49 local men who died serving in World War I. Mothers of the fallen soldiers designed the memorial to mirror the crosses that mark graves in American cemeteries overseas. The cross was deeded to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1961, after a highway was built around it. It stood without conflict until 2012, when nearby residents sued, arguing that they are offended by the government\u2019s endorsement of religion and the fact that the cross is maintained with taxpayer money. The Trump administration supported the American Legion and urged the justices to take a historical approach to the case. Why it matters: After oral arguments it seemed like the justices were going to rule in favor of the cross. But will the ruling be narrow only covering war memorials that stand in public parks, or could the court go farther to allow more religion in the public sphere instances like holiday displays, prayer at public meetings, \u201cin God We Trust\u201d on coins? Curtis Flowers, an African-American on death row, was tried five times for the 1996 murder of four people inside a furniture store in Winona, Mississippi. But it was only in 2010, after his sixth trial, that a conviction stuck and Flowers was sentenced to death. Now, his lawyers want his conviction reversed. They want justices to hold that Flower\u2019s rights were violated by the prosecutor, Doug Evans, who they say engaged in race discrimination during jury selection. During oral arguments \u2013 where Justice Clarence Thomas asked a rare question \u2013 the justices seemed ready to rule in favor of Flowers. The question will be how broad the ruling will be. Why it matters: Supporters of Flowers say the Supreme Court needs to add teeth to the decision \u2013 called Batson v. Kentucky \u2013because prosecutors can get around it by simply supplying race neutral justifications while building mostly white juries. Entrepreneur Erik Brunetti says he founded a clothing brand \u2013 called FUCT \u2013 in 1990 to question authority and the assumptions of society. On the way, he also triggered a First Amendment dispute that has landed at the highest court in the land. Brunetti says, his company\u2019s name stands for FRIENDS U CAN\u2019T TRUST. In 2011, he sought to register the mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to obtain benefits such as expanding rights against others attempting to use the same mark. But the office did not buy Brunetti\u2019s explanation for the meaning of FUCT. Instead, it said the word was the \u201cphonetic equivalent\u201d of the past tense of a vulgar word. It refused Brunetti\u2019s request determining that federal law prohibits the registration of trademarks that consist of \u201cscandalous\u201d subject matter. Justices keep it clean in debate over FUCT trademark Now the Supreme Court, for the second time in two years, will review whether provisions of a federal law, the Lanham Act violate the First Amendment. Why it matters: If the justices rule in favor of Brunetti, they could open the doors to more so-called \u201cscandalous\u201d marks in the marketplace and even broaden a category of speech protected by the Constitution. At oral argument, however, they seemed to suggest that they might uphold the statute as it applied to some really offensive words. Patrick Murphy, a member of the Creek Nation, was convicted of murdering a fellow tribe member, George Jacobs, and sentenced to death by Oklahoma in 2000. But Murphy argued he was tried in the wrong court. He said his crime occurred on Indian territory, and that the federal government, not the state, had jurisdiction. His case raises a question that could have broad repercussions and could impact at a minimum 2,000 other prisoners in state court and self-identify as Native American. The 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Murphy\u2019s favor holding that the state lacked the jurisdiction because Congress had never \u201cdisestablished\u201d the 1866 boundaries of the Creek nation that encompasses 3,079,095 acres. Currently 1.8 million Oklahomans live on the land. Under federal law, major crimes committed by Indians on Indian country must be tried in federal court. Murphy\u2019s death penalty case opened a hornet\u2019s nest for the court. Lisa Blatt, a lawyer for Oklahoma, warned if the Supreme Court were to uphold the lower court opinion it would be a blow to the State\u2019s power to prosecute and burden federal authorities forcing them to investigate and prosecute hundreds of new cases each year. Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case as he dealt with the case previously when it came before the 10th Circuit. Why it matters: if the court were to affirm the lower court the government says it would impact pending and past convictions and broaden the government\u2019s authority. The Double Jeopardy clause to the Fifth Amendment prohibits more than one prosecution for the same offense. There is an exception, however, that is called the \u201cseparate sovereigns exception.\u201d Under the exception, prosecutions are allowed to bring charges for the same offense if the charges are brought by state and federal government. The Supreme Court is being asked to get rid separate sovereigns exception. Critics contend that in the modern day it leads to harassment of defendants \u2013 especially the poor \u2013 who can\u2019t afford to fight on two fronts. The case could impact President Donald Trump\u2019s pardon power as it applies to the Robert Mueller probe. The thinking goes that if he pardoned someone like Paul Manafort, then state officials could not bring the same charge against him. Others say that it would have no impact because state prosecutors would be savvy enough to bring charges for a different offense. 'The Chief': John Roberts' journey from 'sober puss' to the pinnacle of American law The Trump administration argued that the exception should remain on the books. Why it matters: On one hand, the federal government and others say this exception is meant to protect the independent power of state and federal governments. It has been a part of the court\u2019s fabric for more than 150 years. At issue is a dispute between Marine veteran James L. Kisor, who is seeking disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress disorder, and the Department of Veterans Affairs that had declined to award him retroactive benefits. But lurking behind the case is a much bigger legal dispute over whether courts should defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations when there is ambiguity. In legalese it\u2019s called \u201cAuer deference.\u201d Why it matters: Conservatives \u2013 like former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who attended oral arguments \u2013 argue that agencies have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power. But progressives argue that agency deference is important for the regulation of big business and the protection of consumers, the environment and workers.",

            "article_content": "In August 1985, 42-year-old Delaware Sen. Joe Biden was preparing for his first presidential bid. Courting southern support, Biden traveled to Mississippi to honor the 84th birthday of Democratic Sen. John Stennis, who had served since 1947, at a celebration attended by thousands, including 10 Senate colleagues. In his speech, Biden praised Stennis, an opponent of the landmark civil rights bills of the 1960s, by comparing him to Confederate General Stonewall Jackson and portraying both men as a \u201cthunderbolt from a clear sky.\u201d He continued his endorsement of Stennis\u2019 work by adding, \u201cAnd as all of my colleagues have said here today, and you\u2019ll hear others say more of, he truly does stand like a stone wall, he is the rockbound integrity of the United States Congress.\u201d Now in his third run for the presidency, Biden presents his ability to respect and work with ideological opponents as an asset that could return the country to a bygone era of bipartisanship and consensus. His long record on civil rights gives him much to campaign on, as does his service as vice president to the nation\u2019s first black president. Yet Biden\u2019s outreach to and past praise of senators who opposed civil rights and supported segregation in the 1950s and 1960s has come under increased scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted dramatically in the years since. News reports have questioned how his eulogy of South Carolina GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond in 2003 would fare with a new generation of voters today. In April, Biden eulogized former South Carolina Democratic Sen. Ernest \u201cFritz\u201d Hollings, who evolved from a segregationist to a supporter of civil rights who endorsed Rev. Jesse Jackson for president in 1988. To better understand those past relationships and how Biden worked with his Senate colleagues from that era, CNN\u2019s KFile team reviewed a copy of Biden\u2019s 1985 speech from Stennis\u2019 senatorial papers at Mississippi State University. Stennis\u2019 files touch on that relationship, including handwritten notes, newspaper clippings, and letters that offer a deeper exploration of the warm relationship between the pair. Stennis was an admired member of the Senate who served for a decade as chairman of the Armed Services Committee in the 1970s and was the first Democrat to condemn the actions of Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s on the Senate floor, but he was also a leading member of a group of southern senators who frequently opposed civil rights bills and later the establishment of a federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. in 1983. Stennis, Biden said in the 1985 speech, was a mentor whom he viewed as \u201ca legend\u201d upon entering the Senate in 1973, which was less than a decade removed from Stennis\u2019 votes against landmark civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Citing a speech Stennis gave at a caucus meeting during Watergate, Biden said that the Mississippi senator \u201ccast a shadow that stretches far and wide.\u201d Biden joined the Senate after the civil rights fights of the 1960s, but he established himself as a supporter of civil rights, including affirmative action and moving to end employment discrimination. In his 2020 campaign, Biden, along with other Democratic presidential hopefuls, has made President Donald Trump\u2019s divisive racial rhetoric central to his campaign, denouncing the President\u2019s response to a deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he said there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides. Biden has fared strongly in recent polls among black voters. During his Senate career, Biden worked with prominent opponents of civil rights like Thurmond and Democratic Sen. Jim Eastland, Stennis\u2019 longtime Mississippi colleague. CNN has previously reported on other letters from the 1970s that show Biden appealing to senators who supported segregation in the 1950s, seeking their support in his legislative fight against school busing. Like Biden, Stennis and Eastland were opponents of busing as a means to desegregate schools. A spokesperson for Biden recently told CNN that the former vice president\u2019s opposition was because he felt mandatory busing was an insufficient means to equal opportunity for students. In a statement to CNN, Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, did not directly address Biden\u2019s relationships with Stennis, Eastland and Thurmond, but said, \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s record shows that advancing civil rights and uprooting systemic racism have been defining causes of his entire life. In the United States Senate, he championed the Voting Rights Act \u2013 securing multiple extensions of that critical law \u2013 fought to outlaw housing discrimination, and took on the big banks over redlining. As Vice President, he fought voter suppression efforts and helped reduce the federal prison population by over 38,000.\u201d Stennis, who was first elected senator in 1947, had a long record as an ardent opponent of civil rights. In the 1950s and 1960s, he opposed desegregation of public schools, the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Like other prominent opponents of civil rights and school integration, Stennis claimed to oppose such laws on the basis of states\u2019 rights. He was noted for using less inflammatory rhetoric in opposing civil rights than some of his Senate colleagues. During what was seen as a competitive re-election fight in 1982, Stennis sought the support of black voters by voting to extend the Voting Rights Act saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go back to the old days about voting. We know a lot more about it than we did before. I think we\u2019ve done pretty well in Mississippi. We\u2019ve elected more black officials than anybody else.\u201d Just one year later, Stennis would vote in 1983 against recognizing Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s birthday as a federal holiday. He was one of only four Democrats and 18 Republicans who voted against it, with a spokesman saying at the time that Stennis thought \u201cwe already had more than enough holidays\u201d and that he instead supported a commemorative day. President Ronald Reagan suggested the same before signing the legislation into law. Biden would go on to defend Stennis and Thurmond from charges of racism later in their lives, calling them captives of their eras who changed with the times. In his autobiography, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Biden wrote Stennis turned away from his past. \u201cIn the years I\u2019d known him, John Stennis turned away from his segregationist past,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cThere are a whole lot of people who see his transformation as a journey of political expedience. I choose to see it as a journey of the heart \u2013 a sincere desire to reflect the more generous instincts of Mississippians, and to honor the aspirations of all Americans.\u201d When Biden first joined the Senate, he said Stennis befriended him shortly after he had lost his wife and one-year-old daughter in a car accident. Biden recalled in his book that Stennis asked him why he had run for office. \u201cCivil rights, sir,\u201d Biden wrote he told Stennis. Biden recalled Stennis responded, \u201c\u2018Civil rights? Good,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Good. Good. Glad to have you here.\u2019\u201d The pair, according to Biden in his Senate farewell address, would become close friends, at one point sharing a hospital room in the 1980s at Walter Reed Army Medical Center when Stennis had cancer and Biden had surgery to correct a brain aneurysm. Biden later wrote vividly of an encounter with the older senator in 1989 when Stennis retired and Biden moved into his old office. Biden recounts the occasion in detail, including Stennis\u2019 very personal take on civil rights. \u201c\u2018You see this table, Joe? This table was the flagship of the Confederacy from 1954 to 1968. We sat here, most of us from the Deep South, the old Confederacy, and we planned the demise of the civil rights movement,\u2019\u201d Biden wrote Stennis said. \u201c\u2019And we lost. And, Joe, now it\u2019s time that this table go from the possession of a man who was against civil rights to a man who was for civil rights.\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018The civil rights movement did more to free the white man than the black man,\u2019\u201d Stennis said, according to Biden. \u201cHe could see me looking at him, confused, and he pounded on his chest. \u2018It freed my soul,\u2019 he said. \u2018It freed my soul.\u2019\u201d Still, Stennis would officially make no apologies for his past opposition to civil rights bills upon his retirement. In the 1980s, he said he had believed that they \u201cwere too abrupt, went too far and were out-of-line.\u201d Stennis added, \u201cWe finally got out of that extremism. It takes time, takes time to make adjustments.\u201d Historians who spoke with CNN\u2019s KFile said Biden\u2019s relationships with these senators made pragmatic sense for the time. \u201cThese were powerful and influential people and they, you know, they certainly were not going anywhere,\u201d said Jason Ward, a professor of history at Emory University. \u201cThis also informs Biden\u2019s kind of wistful insistence on returning to some sort of era of bipartisanship, within his political lifetime \u2013 he\u2019s not simply talking about Democrats and Republicans getting along. He\u2019s talking about getting along with, an extinct generation of Democrats.\u201d In Biden\u2019s notes to Stennis, which KFile saw in the documents kept at Mississippi State University, he reflected on what occupying his friend\u2019s office meant personally. \u201cI have bittersweet feeling about moving into an office of such distinction. The bitterness relates to the knowledge that you will no longer be in the Senate and the sweetness to the knowledge that I will have a constant reminder of the man I viewed as a hero from the time,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI sat next you at your conference table on my second day as a U.S. senator. You are a great man Senator Stennis and I will try to live up to the great and honorable tradition of the man who last occupied the office.\u201d In his farewell address to the Senate, Biden reiterated that he got started in politics because of civil rights, and never expected he\u2019d develop such strong friendships with senators like Eastland, Stennis, and Thurmond. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d develop deep personal relationships with men whose position played an extremely large part in my desire to come to the Senate in the first place to change what they believed in \u2013 Eastland, Stennis, Thurmond,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAll these men became my friends.\u201d In one January 1975 letter, after Stennis helped Biden secure a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Biden wrote, \u201cI will make every effort to fulfill your confidence\u201d and that he hoped Stennis would \u201cshare with me your views on foreign policy matters\u201d when they came up in committee. In April of that year, Biden told Stennis in a letter \u201cI shall always treasure your writing\u201d and that \u201cobservations coming from you can only be flattering and estimable.\u201d And in 1980, Biden wrote a brief but admiring letter to Stennis where he said, \u201cThere a few \u2018gentlemen\u2019 that I have ever had the pleasure of getting to know and work with. You have increased the field by one. You are quite a man.\u201d In his 1985 birthday speech for Stennis, Biden praised him as \u201can opponent without hate, a friend without treachery, a statesman without pretense, a victim without any murmuring, a public official without vice, a private citizen without wrong, a neighbor, as you all know, without hypocrisy, a man without guilt \u2013 a senator whom future senators can study with profit for as long as there is an America.\u201d Comparing Stennis to Stonewall Jackson in that speech, Biden said, \u201cIt was said of Stonewall Jackson, \u2018He is an avalanche from an unexpected quarter, a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and yet his character and will make him a stone wall and more of a stone wall than any man I\u2019ve ever known.\u2019\u201d Biden continued: \u201cAnd, Mr. Chairman, when you stand on the floor of the Senate and you point that finger and you raise your voice, it\u2019s like a bolt from a clear sky, and when you speak, everyone listens. And as all of my colleagues have said here today, and you\u2019ll hear others say more of, he truly does stand like a stone wall, he is the rockbound integrity of the United States Congress.\u201d Biden also recalled receiving a letter from Stennis soon after he delivered his first speech on the Senate floor. \u201cAnd then he wrote me a letter that I have hanging on my wall, and I\u2019ve shown it to him, it\u2019s framed. He said, \u2018Today, in the United States Senate, I\u2019ve witnessed a young man who has become a senator. You stood like a stone wall.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "2020 Democratic presidential candidates are plunging into the debate over restrictive new abortion laws in states like Alabama, Georgia and Missouri \u2013 making abortion rights a central part of their messaging as some charge President Donald Trump with waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d Republicans have often sought to seize on the decades-long battle over abortion rights. Judicial appointments and Supreme Court vacancies have energized segments of their evangelical, anti-abortion base in election years. But with the installation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as the fifth conservative justice on the court and efforts by conservative state legislatures to drastically restrict abortion rights, Democrats are taking the opportunity to rally their own voters, particularly women. This was most evident Tuesday as a parade of presidential contenders joined demonstrators on the steps of the Supreme Court to protest Alabama\u2019s decision to pass the most restrictive abortion law in the country last week \u2013 a measure that includes no exceptions for rape or incest \u2013 as well as the so-called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d sweeping through statehouses in the South. Abortion rights advocates protest to 'stop the bans' as more states pass fetal heartbeat bills As demonstrators from groups like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU voiced their outrage about the state measures intended to challenge the landmark 1973 decision known as Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in all 50 states, six of the 2020 candidates \u2013 two of them women \u2013 showed up vowing to fight measures that endanger women\u2019s reproductive rights under Roe. \u201cThis is something that President Trump has unleashed,\u201d New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said in an interview with CNN from the rally, with pink-shirted protesters from Planned Parenthood standing behind her. \u201cHe apparently wants to have a war on women in America, and if this is a war that he wants to have, he will have it, and he will lose it, because American women are not going to accept this.\u201d In a tweet over the weekend, Trump made it clear that he supports exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and the health of the mother. Democrats recognized the power of female voters in driving the outcome of the 2018 elections, flipping the House of Representatives from Republican to Democratic control and electing more than a 100 women to the House for the first time. The six women who are competing for the 2020 Democratic nomination have also highlighted the ascendant power of female voters \u2013 crafting plans that would offer greater assistance with childcare, eliminate pay inequity or address racial disparities in health care, including maternal mortality. On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren highlighted her plan to pass federal laws that she says would ensure \u201creal access to birth control and abortion care for all women.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who was also at the rally at the Supreme Court, vowed Wednesday to take executive action if elected to protect abortion rights, including creating a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom to oversee his administration\u2019s efforts. The tone and tenor of the debate are an abrupt reversal from just months ago when Democrats were on defense on abortion, facing uncomfortable conversations about controversial new measures protecting certain late-term abortions in New York and Virginia. That led Trump to attack Democrats as \u201cpushing for late-term abortion\u201d at his political rallies, though he often distorted the facts around the measures that were being proposed. Now the success of anti-abortion advocates in passing restrictive new laws in Ohio, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Kentucky have shifted the conversation. In a telling sign of the ripple effect that the strict new state laws are having, lawmakers in Nevada \u2013 which has the first female-majority legislature in the country after the 2018 elections \u2013 removed several restrictions on abortion Tuesday night. The Nevada Assembly passed a bill Tuesday rewriting part of a state abortion law that required physicians to tell pregnant women about the \u201cemotional implications\u201d of having an abortion. Under the new changes, Nevada doctors would have to describe only the \u201cnature and consequences\u201d of the procedure to their patients. Physicians will no longer need to certify pregnant women\u2019s marital status and ages in writing before performing an abortion. The assembly voted 27-13 in favor of the bill; it passed the Senate in April 12-9. The bill has to go back to the Senate for a final vote on an amendment before going to the governor\u2019s desk. In addition to Gillibrand, five other Democratic presidential candidates showed up at the abortion rights rally on the steps of the Supreme Court on Tuesday to telegraph their outrage about what they framed as \u201cextreme\u201d abortion restrictions, with many other candidates weighing in to show their support by tweet. Klobuchar shared Gillibrand\u2019s view that the Trump administration was to blame for some of the new bans. \u201cI think it shows us what this administration had planned for a very long time. This is not just a coincidence that one state did it and then another state. No, this was a plan,\u201d Klobuchar said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean. \u201cYou go back to 2016 when the President was running for office and had a town hall meeting. He was asked, \u2018Well, what should happen if a woman has an abortion?\u2019 and he said she should be punished. \u2026 A few hours later, his campaign clarified it and said no, we mean the doctor should be punished.\u201d \u201cWell, look at what these laws are,\u201d Klobuchar continued. \u201cThey are right in that direction. You\u2019ve got a law that would basically put doctors in prison for 99 years. You have a law that basically says \u2026 if you\u2019re raped and you\u2019re a college student, you don\u2019t have a choice in the matter if you get pregnant.\u201d Seeking to highlight the broader consensus across America on abortion, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg spoke to the difficulty that these restrictive new laws are posing for Republicans. Advocates pushing for these strict abortion laws, he said, \u201care not only implementing bad policy, but they are deepening the unpopularity of this party and this administration.\u201d \u201cMost American, including many Republicans, believe in women\u2019s reproductive rights,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cand when you see an outright ban, that is just showing how extreme the Republican Party has become in my lifetime.\u201d A poll by Fox News in January showed that 6 in 10 registered voters say that Roe v Wade ought to remain in place; while 21% said they would like to see the court decision overturned. Even among Republicans, there is no clear push for overturning the law, just 37% said they\u2019d like to see that happen. And there is not a sharp gender divide on the issue, 59% of women said Roe should stand while 54% of men agreed with that position. The new ban in Alabama, which does not make exceptions for rape or incest, is a position that is far beyond where most Americans stand on the issue. Seventy-seven percent of voters believe abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest during the first three months of pregnancy, according to a 2018 Gallup poll. Without mentioning the Alabama law in his tweet this weekend, Trump made it clear that he did not agree with measures that do not include exceptions for rape and incest. \u201cAs most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\u201d The protest Tuesday, organized by Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and NARAL, drew out a crowd that was dominated by women, many of them from local colleges, advocacy groups in Washington and even staffers on Capitol Hill. Some of the 2020 candidates walked across the street from the Capitol and wandered into the crowd \u2013 surprising demonstrators who ended up face to face with Buttigieg, Gillibrand and the others. Protest organizers did not initially plan for any of the 2020 candidates to speak, but a number of them did anyway. Federal judge slams Mississippi over new law banning abortions after six weeks Sen. Bernie Sanders, told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean that he showed up at the event \u201cbecause the right for a woman to control her own body is a fundamental constitutional right and we have got to do everything we can to defend it.\u201d California Rep. Eric Swalwell also attended the rally. A number of candidates were unable to attend the rally because of prior conflicts, but still sent along their support, including Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 who was campaigning in Iowa before Tuesday night\u2019s CNN town hall \u2013 and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris. During that town hall, O\u2019Rourke laid out a plan to protect women\u2019s reproductive rights, including only nominating judges who support Roe v. Wade, doing away with the gag rule and the Hyde Amendment and passing legislation in Congress to protect abortion rights. \u201cFor so long, women have been leading this fight, shouldering the burden of making sure that their reproductive rights are protected. It is time all of us join them in this fight,\u201d he said. Warren issued a call to action and tweeted a link to her plan to protect reproductive health care. \u201cThe time to act is now. Get into the fight, run for office, and make these right-wing Republican lawmakers face the consequences of their actions,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: #RoeVWade established a woman\u2019s constitutional right to safe, legal abortion & has been the law of the land for over 46 years. An overwhelming majority of Americans don\u2019t want to return to a world before Roe. But extremist Republicans are fighting to do just that.\u201d Biden tweeted that \u201cstates across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman\u2019s constitutional right to choose.\u201d \u201cThese bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s pernicious. We must #StopTheBans and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.\u201d A Biden campaign spokesperson told CNN Wednesday Biden \u201cbelieves that codifying Roe (v. Wade) through legislation must be pursued.\u201d \u201cGeorgia, Alabama, and Missouri are passing extreme laws in order to prevent a woman to be able to have an abortion under virtually any circumstance,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cRoe v. Wade lays out a constitutional guarantee that a woman can, in fact, make a choice between she and her doctor.\u201d Harris also weighed in via tweet, vowing to \u201cfight with everything we have to defend access to reproductive health care.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more powerful than people speaking up for what we all know is right,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI stand in solidarity with those across the country to #StopTheBans.\u201d She also posted a clip from her Los Angeles rally this weekend where she said that the passage of the bills in Alabama and Missouri last week \u201cmade clear that reproductive health care is under attack and we will not stand for it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean, Jennifer Agiesta, Dan Merica and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Eight months after the contentious hearings over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, progressives fear that the most dire warnings of abortion rights groups are now coming to fruition. This week, Alabama passed the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion ban, soon followed by Missouri passing its own strict anti-abortion legislation. Other bills elsewhere have either been signed into law or are working their way through legislatures \u2013 with expectations on both sides that the issue will eventually come before the Supreme Court. This momentum has thrust women\u2019s reproductive rights to the forefront of the political debate, with leaders weighing in from the halls of Congress to the campaign trail where the 2020 election debate is already at fever pitch. Still, the nationwide political fight over abortion rights comes at a time when 77% of voters support access to abortion in the case of rape and incest during the first trimester. \u201cWe think that women understand their rights are under fire and that there is a dire need to ensure that the right policymakers are making the decisions,\u201d said Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for EMILY\u2019s List. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a bunch of mostly male Republicans making really bad decisions on behalf of the women in this country.\u201d \u201cThis is a deliberate Republican effort to end abortion altogether and to take away this right,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI think a number of us thought this was coming. For those of us who didn\u2019t, this has been a massive wake-up call.\u201d But anti-abortion activists argued that Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion, was \u201cfar from being settled law.\u201d \u201cAcross the nation there is growing momentum, informed by science and compassion, and spurred on in reaction to abortion extremism in New York and Virginia, to recognize the humanity of the unborn child in the law. It is clearer than ever that Roe is far from being settled law in the eyes and hearts of the American people, and this is increasingly reflected in state legislatures,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. \u201cThe American people want a fresh debate and a new direction, achieved by consensus and built on love for both mothers and babies.\u201d \u201cThe time is coming for the Supreme Court to let that debate go forward.\u201d Alabama\u2019s passage of a near-total ban on abortion, with no exceptions in the case of race and incest, was a stunning development this week. It was another incremental step in the state-by-state strategy of abortion foes to dismantle abortion rights in this country, and an alarm bell for women who have not paid close attention to the spate of restrictive abortion bills that have moved quickly through state legislatures this year. Though it could be years before the Supreme Court takes up any of the direct challenges to Roe v. Wade \u2013 the bill already faces many likely legal challenges from groups such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood  \u2013  the passage of the Alabama bill immediately recast the political debate, in part because the bill\u2019s backers were so explicit about their intention to force the Supreme Court to reconsider the legality of abortion. \u201cMany Americans, myself included, disagreed when Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973,\u201d Republican Gov. Kay Ivey said this week when she signed the bill (which also says doctors who perform abortions could face up to 99 years in prison). \u201cThe sponsors of this bill believe that it is time, once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter, and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur.\u201d If Alabama were a country, this is how its abortion law would stack up The Alabama law also captured the nation\u2019s attention because Ivey signed it into law a mere week after Georgia passed its so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The pairing of the two measures immediately electrified the debate in the 2020 presidential race, compelled Democratic donors to contribute to abortion rights groups, and even stoked debate in Hollywood over whether to halt ongoing productions in Georgia. Officials with Planned Parenthood have tracked at least 15 abortion bans that have already passed through state legislatures this year. Four of the bills would ban abortion starting at six weeks, and the Alabama law stands alone as an outright ban. On Friday, the Missouri House passed a bill that prohibits abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy; it would allow exceptions for medical emergencies, but not rape or incest. Already cleared by the Senate, it now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who has said he would sign it. \u201cRemember, these politicians are trying to set up a fight over the right to access abortion in an election year \u2013 making sure the issue of abortion is front and center in voters\u2019 minds,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, the executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u201cThe vast majority of Americans support access to abortion, and this is an issue they vote on.\u201d \u201cWe know that this is not what women voters want. We know this is not what Americans want. We know that support for access to abortion crosses party lines,\u201d Robinson added. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing this create discord in the Republican Party. There\u2019s no way this doesn\u2019t backfire with voters across America.\u201d The reaction from Republicans on Capitol Hill was muted \u2013 reflecting the problems that a roaring abortion debate could create in next year\u2019s elections \u2013 with even House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stating that he did not agree with the Alabama law. President Donald Trump was uncharacteristically quiet when the law passed, even though he has increasingly accused Democrats of advocating for late-term abortion at his campaign rallies. Meanwhile, the 2020 Democrats all vigorously denounced the Alabama law, characterizing it as a dangerous encroachment on the rights of women in this country. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to overturn Roe v. Wade. It\u2019s wrong. And we are going to fight back,\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill Wednesday. By Friday, the senator had rolled out a new proposal that called on Congress to codify federal protections on abortion rights, warning that efforts to undo Roe v. Wade \u201cjust might work.\u201d The heated debate over restrictive state measures has come, ironically, at a time when record numbers of women have been elected to Congress and statehouses across the country. California Rep. Jackie Speier alluded to how the heat, anger and uncertainty over the slate of anti-abortion bills could upend the 2020 election cycle in an interview Wednesday with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Democratic lawmaker opens up about once considering an abortion \u201cIf you thought the pink hats that women were wearing after the 2016 election \u2013 and the 3 million women who marched around this country \u2013 was a significant move, you just wait until this issue is put in front of the (Supreme Court) justices and if they were, in fact, to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Speier said. \u201cThat is a picture in which you will see women with pitchforks.\u201d The political complexity of dealing with restrictive abortion laws like the one in Alabama was immediately apparent as some congressional Republicans quickly distanced themselves from the measure. Maine Republican Susan Collins, one of the swing votes on Kavanaugh, called the Alabama bill \u201ca terrible law\u201d and said she couldn\u2019t imagine \u201cthat any justice could find that to be consistent\u201d with previous precedent. McCarthy, a California Republican charged with trying to regain his party\u2019s majority in 2020, said at his weekly press conference that he opposed the Alabama law because it \u201cgoes further than I believe.\u201d \u201cI believe in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve voted on,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. And even conservative televangelist Pat Robertson said during his weekly show that he thought the Alabama law \u201chas gone too far.\u201d As they look ahead to the 2020 congressional elections, many Republicans are wary of a repeat of the difficulties they faced during the 2012 cycle, when two of their Senate candidates, Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana, made controversial comments about rape that became an albatross for scores of other Republican candidates. Akin talked about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and suggested that a rape victim\u2019s body could prevent unwanted pregnancies; Mourdock said he believed even a pregnancy that originated in rape was \u201csomething God intended to happen.\u201d Trump has not highlighted the new Alabama law this week, but he has fulfilled his promises to evangelicals with his judicial appointments including to the Supreme Court, which is now dominated by five conservatives. At his political rallies, he has used increasingly graphic language to accuse Democrats of embracing an extreme agenda on abortion. \u201cDemocrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother\u2019s wombs, right up until the moment of birth,\u201d Trump said last week at a rally in Panama City, referring to the \u201cpossible execution of the baby.\u201d Backers of legislation like the bill in Alabama have, in turn, become more explicit about their judicial goals. While the abortion issue has percolated in the political debate for decades, this new flashpoint comes at a time when women\u2019s rights and political power are viewed as ascendant, in part as a backlash to Trump. Two years into the Trump administration and in the midst of fallout from the #MeToo movement, female voters turned out in huge numbers in 2018 to elect more than 100 women to the House of Representatives for the first time. Many young women turned out to vote in the midterm elections last fall; some were newly minted activists who went canvassing with their mothers for the first time, because they viewed Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the result of the Kavanaugh hearings as endangering their rights. Six Democratic women are now running for president, casting a brighter spotlight on issues like pay equity, the cost of child care, racial disparities in maternal mortality rates \u2013 and now reproductive rights. Democratic presidential candidates have been quick to make the argument that the draconian abortion laws working their way through state legislatures have endangered the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion in all 50 states. Elizabeth Warren calls for federal protections for abortion rights, warns GOP efforts to overturn Roe 'just might work' \u201cThese extremist Republican lawmakers know what the law is \u2013 but they don\u2019t care,\u201d Warren wrote in her proposal to codify federal protections for abortion rights. \u201cThey want to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion and deny women access to reproductive health care. And they are hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play. I\u2019ll be blunt: It just might work.\u201d New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand took her campaign to the Georgia state Capitol Thursday where she promised to \u201clead the fight for women\u2019s civil rights across the country.\u201d \u201cRight now, entirely too much of the conversation about what women can do with our own bodies is being driven by a group of right-wing male politicians,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for that conversation to be led by the actual experts: women and doctors.\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris denounced the Alabama law at a series of campaign events in New Hampshire, and made it a call to action for Democratic voters. \u201cGeorgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio & now Alabama - these anti-abortion bills aren\u2019t a coincidence, it\u2019s a concerted effort by the GOP to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Harris tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this outright assault on women\u2019s bodily autonomy - we will fight this with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d Harris, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders all sent out missives to their donor lists after the Alabama law was passed encouraging donors to contribute to abortion rights groups. Harris told her donors in a subsequent email that they had raised $160,000 for those groups on Wednesday. Buttigieg weighed in on the Alabama and Georgia laws at greater length during a speech Thursday in Chicago, where he argued that Trump was \u201cable to build a coalition largely around a promise, explicit or implicit, to overturn Roe.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that you are free in this country if your reproductive health can be criminalized by government,\u201d Buttigieg said during a speech Thursday evening in Chicago. \u201cTo see in Alabama that if someone is raped and she seeks an abortion, the doctor who treats her will be penalized with a longer prison term than her rapist makes me question whether the discussion about freedom in this country has gone off the rails.\u201d CNN\u2019s Caroline Kenny and Casey Riddle contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "If Democrats pick Joe Biden as their next presidential nominee, he will set a new standard for political longevity. In the process, he will provoke complex questions about relevance, age and shifting political attitudes in the US. Should Biden prevail next year, he would become the Democratic nominee exactly 50 years after he won his first elected office, to the New Castle County Council in Delaware in 1970. It would be 48 years after Biden first won a federal office by capturing a US Senate seat from Delaware in 1972. No candidate from any major party has captured a presidential nomination for the first time that many years after he or she first won elected office since the formation of the modern party system in 1828, according to a review I conducted of presidential races stretching back to then. Here are the 21 Democrats who have said they're running for president Only two candidates truly come close: Bob Dole and James Buchanan. Dole captured the GOP nomination but lost the general election to Bill Clinton in 1996, 46 years after he was first elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1950, and 36 years after he initially was sent to Washington in 1960 as a US Representative. Buchanan won the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 1856, 42 years after he was first elected to the Pennsylvania state legislature, and 36 years after he was elected as a US Representative, his first federal office. Apart from Dole, no Democratic or Republican candidate since 1892 captured their party\u2019s presidential nomination for the first time more than 28 years after they initially won an elected office (and even that case, as explained below, deserves an asterisk). A longer march to a presidential nomination was more common earlier in the 19th century. But even then, apart from Buchanan, only three other nominees from 1828 through 1896 spanned as much as 30 years between initial election and first presidential nomination, with a maximum difference of 37 years. More recently, presidential nominees have typically captured the prize 14-16 years after their first electoral victory. Some have ascended even faster. George W. Bush won the GOP nomination and the White House in 2000, just six years after his first election, as governor of Texas in 1994; Barack Obama succeeded him in 2008 just 12 years after he first won election as a Democrat to the Illinois state Senate in 1996 and four years after he first won federal office by capturing a US Senate seat in 2004. Candidates with very long political pedigrees have faced a series of interlocking challenges. One is a question of whether they are too old for the job, though in the case of the 76-year-old Biden, that issue may be muted by the advanced age of Bernie Sanders, one of his leading primary opponents, and President Donald Trump, if Biden makes it to the general election. Biden\u2019s age is likely contributing to the sharp age break in his support for the primaries. Both in national polls and surveys in the key early states, he\u2019s consistently polling much better with older than younger Democratic voters. But that\u2019s an acceptable trade for him because voters over 45 constituted three-fifths of all Democratic primary voters in 2016, according to a cumulative CNN analysis of all the exit polls that year. Presidential candidates with decades in politics also must frequently explain policy positions that have gone out of style as the country, and their party, has evolved over their long careers. Dole in 1996 faced pressure to explain his earlier support for tax increases and expansions of some government safety net programs in a party whose center of gravity had moved toward much greater opposition to government spending and taxes. Biden, as I\u2019ve written, will face comparable pressure to explain his more conservative-leaning views on several hot-button racial issues, including school busing and crime, during years when the Democratic Party relied much more heavily than now on the votes of working-class white voters. \u201cYou have been fighting different battles, because there were different priorities,\u201d said George C. Edwards III, a political scientist at Texas A&M University and one of the leading scholars of the presidency. Edwards said that often the only way for long-tenured candidates to deal with those changing party sentiments is to simply renounce their earlier views, as Ronald Reagan \u2013 who had signed a permissive abortion law as California governor \u2013 and George H.W. Bush did in their presidential races by reversing their earlier support for legal abortion. \u201cAnd so they just make it clear that now there is a litmus test and I\u2019m passing it,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey just have to deal with it in that way, and I suppose Biden might have to as well. He\u2019s going to have to do something regarding women\u2019s rights and that sort of thing.\u201d Biden has already gestured in that direction by apologizing for his handling as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman of Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment allegations against Republican Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. Anita Hill says #MeToo could have come in '91 had Biden-led Senate committee 'done its job' Republican media consultant Mike Murphy, an adviser to Dole in his 1996 presidential race, said long-time members of Congress like Dole and Biden face a another fundamental challenge: the skills required to succeed inside a legislative body are often antithetical to succeeding as a presidential candidate. \u201cBecause you have been in the racket a long time, you become by nature of your experience an institutionalist and an insider,\u201d Murphy notes. \u201cThey become a leader inside the club inside the club. Their skill set is very much the small room at the top. They were both quite good at it. And then they try to hop sideways into an arena that\u2019s more about public performance in the modern era, even in the primary. And their skills are much more lined up to get Mitch McConnell halfway on a legislative deal, or Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy, their peers, than to go out and play the digital media game with Beto [O\u2019Rourke] and Kamala [Harris] and Mayor Pete [Buttigieg].\u201d If Biden prevails, he would join another small club: candidates who first won the nomination on their third try for the office. That list includes Buchanan (who failed in 1844 and 1848 before his 1856 victory), Dole (who lost in 1980 and 1988) and Republican James G. Blaine, the \u201cplumed knight,\u201d who won the GOP nomination in 1884 after falling short in 1876 and 1880. None of them approached the 32-year span between Biden\u2019s first bid in 1988 and his current campaign in 2020. (Biden also ran and lost in 2008.) From the 1820s through World War II, several of America\u2019s best-known presidents won their party\u2019s nomination and the White House about 20 to 26 years after their first electoral triumph. Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860, 26 years after he first won a state legislative seat in 1834 and 14 years after he won a seat in the US House in 1846. (Lincoln served only that single term.) Theodore Roosevelt won election in 1904, 23 years after he was first elected to the New York State Assembly, though only six years after he became the state\u2019s governor. Franklin Roosevelt similarly won the White House in 1932, 22 years after his first election to the New York state senate, but only four years after he captured the state\u2019s governorship. Presidents with the longest political lifespans over these decades included a 19th century father-grandson pairing: William Henry Harrison (first nominated by the Whig Party in 1836, 37 years after his initial election as the first congressional representative from the Northwest territory, and then elected president in 1840) and Republican Benjamin Harrison (first elected in 1888, 31 years after he won local office in Indianapolis, though only seven after he came to Washington as a US senator.) Since the turn of the 20th century, as the rise of the mass media has made it easier to become known nationwide, rapid ascents to a party\u2019s nomination have become more common than they once were. The fastest risers include Woodrow Wilson, who won the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 1912, just two years after he won his first office as New Jersey\u2019s governor. Alf Landon won the GOP nomination in 1936 and Adlai Stevenson captured the Democratic nod in 1952 just four years after each won their first offices, the governorships of Kansas and Illinois respectively. Both, however, suffered landslide losses in their general election races. Over the past six decades, the roughly 14-to-16 year political apprenticeship for a presidential nomination has become something of a default. Both Democrat John F. Kennedy and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 won their party\u2019s nomination 14 years after their first elections, each to the US House in 1946. Barry Goldwater won the GOP nomination (before losing the general election to Lyndon Johnson) in 1964, 15 years after he was first elected to the Phoenix City Council and 12 years after his election to the US Senate. George McGovern won the Democratic nomination (but lost the general election to Nixon) in 1972, 16 years after his initial election to the US House. Jimmy Carter became the Democratic nominee in 1976, 13 years after he first won a Georgia State Senate seat and just six years after he was elected the state\u2019s governor. Reagan similarly captured the GOP nomination and beat Carter in 1980, 14 years after his first electoral victory as California governor. Bill Clinton took the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 1992, 16 years after his first election as Arkansas\u2019 Attorney General and 14 years after he captured the state\u2019s governorship. Mitt Romney in 2012 won the GOP nomination ten years after his first electoral victory, as the Massachusetts governor. Obama and W. Bush defined the low end of this recent spectrum. An apprenticeship of about this long has become so routine in modern politics that journalist Jonathan Rauch in 2003 identified a \u201c14 year rule.\u201d (Rauch attributed the idea to presidential speechwriter John McConnell, a presidential speechwriter for George W. Bush.) Rauch, writing in the National Journal, noted that since Theodore Roosevelt \u201cno one has been elected president who took more than 14 years to climb from his first major elective office to election as either president or vice-president.\u201d Rauch discounted second-tier and local offices, such as Clinton\u2019s election as Arkansas attorney general or Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s elections to the New York state legislature, and set his clock ticking only once a future president captured a more consequential position, such as governor or a seat in the US House or Senate. By Rauch\u2019s standard, Biden, who won his first federal position in 1972, would stand out even dramatically from other recent nominees. Looking at all elected offices in a candidate\u2019s history, including local ones, Biden\u2019s position remains unique, even when compared against his most comparable predecessors: other nominees who first served as vice president. Vice presidents, because of their intervening years in another administration, consistently experience a longer span between their first election and selection as their party\u2019s presidential standard-bearer. But even other vice presidents generally achieved their first presidential nomination in about half or less of the 50-year span that Biden would represent. Vice presidents Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush and Al Gore all won their party\u2019s presidential nomination between 22 and 24 years after they won their first elected office. (Only Bush among them won the general election.) Nixon outpaced them by winning his first nomination 14 years after his first election \u2013 though even he didn\u2019t win the presidency until 22 years after that initial victory (on his second try, in 1968). Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson presented a varying experience as vice president: each succeeded a president who died in office and then were nominated in their own right in the succeeding election. But for each of them that nomination also came between 23 and 27 years after they first won elected office. Gerald Ford presented a third variant of the vice presidential route: named vice-president after Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973, Ford succeeded Richard Nixon as president after Nixon resigned amid the Watergate scandal in 1974. Then in 1976, Ford fended off Reagan for the GOP nomination, 28 years after Ford was first elected to the US House from Michigan. (That made Ford, the asterisk case, the presidential nominee with the longest intervening span after his first election since 1892.) Ford then lost the 1976 general election to Jimmy Carter. Some other modern candidates have taken longer to claim their party\u2019s highest prize, though none approach Biden\u2019s span. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, and Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic choice, each won the nomination 26 years after their first election to office. Democrat John Kerry\u2019s 2004 nomination came 22 years after he won Massachusetts\u2019 lieutenant governorship on a ticket with Dukakis. All three lost their general elections. At the other extreme, in the 19th century, the Whig Party and then the Republicans, who succeeded the Whigs as the principal competitors to Democrats in the 1850s, frequently nominated as their presidential candidates military generals without any previous political experience. Democrats were always somewhat less inclined toward presidential nominees without political experience and since 1900, all of their nominees have held at least some previous elected office. (The nearest exception was Alton B. Parker, the party\u2019s sacrificial lamb in Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s 1904 reelection, whose only previous electoral victories had been in New York state judicial elections during the late 19th century.) Since the turn of the 20th century, Republicans have displayed much greater willingness than Democrats to pick nominees who had never before won elected office. Those include engineer and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover in 1928, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and two business executives making their first bid for office: Wendell Willkie in 1940 and, of course, Donald Trump in 2016. Edwards, the political scientist, notes that there have never been absolute rules about whether the public prefers fresh faces in the White House or those with more political experience. \u201cIt depends on the era. It\u2019s being at the right place at the right time, what is the context at the time you are running with your demographics,\u201d he says. Just as Dole did in 1996, Biden may find it difficult to adapt to the pace of a political competition that has accelerated almost incalculably since he first honed his electoral skills decades earlier. \u201cThey are switching games,\u201d said Murphy, the Republican consultant. \u201cYes they have been a professional athlete for 50 years, but they have been on the golf tour and now they are switching over and they are in the National Football League where the average age is 27.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s own advanced age, he has proven a master at manipulating this fast-paced political cycle. Yet in other ways, he may provide the ideal backdrop for a Biden candidacy. After all the turmoil of the Trump years, Edwards notes, the experience Biden is offering may be \u201creassuring to the public.\u201d In other contexts, Biden\u2019s unprecedented longevity might make him appear stale to voters. But after Trump\u2019s unstinting tumult, Edwards notes, for many voters \u201cthere might be a desire for a return to normalcy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "He slept on a friend\u2019s couch, hustled for odd jobs and hitchhiked along the campaign trail. In the 1970s, Bernie Sanders, then in his 30s, ran \u2013 over and over again in Vermont \u2013 and lost repeatedly, never cracking double digits. In a series of quixotic bids at statewide office as a member of the self-described \u201cradical\u201d Liberty Union Party, he railed against corporate titans and promised to eliminate laws regulating drugs, homosexuality and, before the Supreme Court stepped in, abortion. He campaigned in a local prison and spoke forcefully about racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The government, he said during a talk about desegregation busing, \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a sh** about black people.\u201d Unlike so many other public figures with long careers or winding arcs, Sanders did not arrive at this moment of national reckoning through a personal or political \u201cevolution.\u201d He broke through, instead, with an uncompromising, insistent vision of radical upheaval \u2013 and a taste for conflict with the forces determined to keep him on the fringes. The consistency of Sanders\u2019 message over time has become a cornerstone of his presidential pitch. This account, which spans parts of seven years in the 1970s, was drawn from a CNN KFile review of thousands of pages of archived Liberty Union Party files and newspaper articles newly available online, as well as interviews with longtime acquaintances and onlookers. Many of the speeches, editorials and interviews featured here are nearly indistinguishable from what Sanders might have said just the other day, out on the presidential hustings, although the sharper edges of his message have slightly softened over time. He is still fighting, as the 2020 primaries near, many of the same battles he first joined during his early campaigns as a member of the Liberty Union Party in the 1970s. The stage now is much bigger and the stakes, in the second half of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, are astronomically higher, but Sanders is still telling the same story \u2013 of a country coming apart at the seams, in desperate need of political revolution. Sanders would run for office in Vermont four times as a member of Liberty Union, from 1972 to 1977. He then left the party, frustrated by its inability to crack the locks of power. But these were not wilderness years. The \u201970s, for Sanders, were an education. He began the decade as a political neophyte with no ties to his new home state. A New York-born and Chicago-educated activist in search of new politics, he would emerge as one of the most well-known progressive political figures in Vermont. In 1981, just shy of his 40th birthday, he would leverage that reputation into a successful run for mayor of Burlington. Sanders then was elected to the US House in 1990 and the Senate in 2006. \u201cWhat you see is what you get. What you see is what you\u2019ve always got,\u201d said John Franco, who ran for office in 1974 and 1976 under the Liberty Union banner and worked in his administration when Sanders became mayor of Burlington. \u201cWe used to call this his standard speech \u2013 we call it the \u2018yellow legal pad speech\u2019 because he would write it on a yellow legal pad and he would give, it would be the same goddamn speech he\u2019d given 400 times in the past!\u201d Franco said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the same speech. I cannot watch him in debates anymore. I won\u2019t watch him in debates. I\u2019ve heard it all before a thousand times.\u201d It was October 1973 and Sanders was giving a talk on the radio. \u201cThere are two worlds in America \u2013 and two worlds here in the state of Vermont,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of those worlds is the world of Richard Nixon, and the millionaires and billionaires he represents. This is the world of the 2% of the population that owns one-third of the personally held wealth in America.\u201d Now, in 2019, Sanders wrote in a recent column: \u201cToday, while hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college and millions are struggling with high levels of student debt, the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent.\u201d The message remains basically the same, only the numbers and the characters have changed. Nixon has given way to Trump, and the Koch Brothers, a favorite target in this decade, have replaced the Rockefellers. When President Gerald Ford selected former New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller to be his vice president, Sanders lashed out at the decision, calling it a \u201ctragedy for the nation\u201d and \u201can insult to every working person in the country.\u201d The Rockefeller fortune, he said, represented \u201ca dangerous threat to the economic and political well-being of America.\u201d \u201cAmerica is supposed to be a democracy, not an oligarchy. Our leaders are supposed to come from the ranks of the people and represent the needs of the people,\u201d Sanders said. But what to do? \u201cWe should begin the task of dismantling their economic empire,\u201d he continued, \u201cand developing an economy which will produce wealth for all the people, and not for the privileged few.\u201d In his current campaign for the presidency, Sanders is attempting to strike a delicate balance between blistering criticism of Trump \u2013 whom he routinely calls a racist and pathological liar \u2013 while trying to claw back for the left a swath of working class white voters who opted for the President\u2019s right-wing populism in 2016. Sanders demonstrated an ability to win them over in Vermont, whose population was 94.5% white, according to the most recent census, and, in a prescient essay from the second issue of Movement, a small magazine put out by Liberty Union that he published and edited, wrote about the resentment of those voters and the danger presented by a politician who could tap into it. His subject in 1972 was George Wallace, the former segregationist and governor of Alabama, who won nearly 10 million votes in the 1968 general election. In interviews with Wallace supporters, Sanders said he found \u201ca certain feeling of admiration and respect for\u201d their anger at the political system but feared that, with Wallace\u2019s influence growing, their collective rage posed an existential threat to civil rights and American pluralism. \u201cI came away from these Wallace interviews with two basic feelings. First, that democracy in America (in any sense of the word) just might not make it,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cMy mind flashed to scenes of Germany in the late 1920\u2019s. Confusion, rebellion, frustration, economic instability, a wounded national pride, ineffectual political leadership \u2013 and the desire for a strong man who would do something, who would bring order out of the chaos.\u201d \u201cCould it happen here?\u201d Sanders asked, \u201cWith the inability of the national leadership to solve the real problems facing this country, could the blacks, long-hairs, \u2018welfare chiselers,\u2019 and political dissidents become the Jews and Communists of the Nazi experience? Could it happen here? I see no reason why it couldn\u2019t.\u201d Sanders in more recent campaign speeches has accused Trump of playing similar notes by stoking anger and weaponizing racism during a time of social unrest. \u201cThis President is the first President in the modern history of our country who is trying to divide our people up based on the color of their skin, the country they were born in, their sexual orientation, their gender, their religion,\u201d he said at a CNN town hall in February. Campaigning in 2019, Sanders rarely looks back beyond the 2016 election. The ideas he ran on then, he\u2019s fond of recalling, were deemed \u201ctoo radical\u201d by mainstream Democrats and the political media. But then, Sanders likes to say, \u201ca funny thing happened\u201d and only three years later, here he stands - in Iowa, in New Hampshire, California and South Carolina, New York and Chicago \u2013 among the front-runners for the party\u2019s presidential nomination and one of the most influential politicians in America. Sanders knows how quickly social and political norms can change. The 1971-1972 Liberty Union platform called for eliminating all laws related to abortions, drugs, homosexual relationships and birth control. It arrived two years before Roe v. Wade and just after New York City\u2019s Stonewall Riots \u2013 when police raided a gay bar in Greenwich Village and set off protests now widely viewed as a catalyst for the modern LGBT rights movement. At the time, every state but two had anti-sodomy laws on their books. \u201cIt strikes me as incredible that politicians think that they have the right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body,\u201d Sanders said in 1972. \u201cThis is especially true in Vermont, where we have a legislature which is almost completely dominated by men.\u201d Bernie Sanders in the 1970s urged nationalization of most major industries The party platform introduced Sanders as a conscientious objector who refused to join the military during the still-ongoing Vietnam War and announced Liberty Union\u2019s support for women and the black liberation movement, citing the \u201cdeep and abiding racial and sexual discrimination\u201d in American life. The relentless bombing of Vietnam, Sanders said at the time, was an \u201catrocity.\u201d After anti-war veterans temporarily seized control of the Statue of Liberty in protest, he sent them a telegram congratulating their \u201ccourageous act.\u201d Speaking outside a prison where he campaigned in 1972, Sanders blasted a criminal justice system that disproportionately locked up minorities. \u201cIt says a great deal about our country that the richer our country gets, the more of us there are behind prison bars and that an overwhelming number of those who are in jail are poor, nonwhites,\u201d Sanders said. On the politically charged topic of desegregation busing, Sanders expressed concerns about the program\u2019s unintended consequences. The Middlebury College campus newspaper reported in 1974 that Sanders believed busing \u2013 \u201c(doing) bad in the guise of good things,\u201d as he put it \u2013 risked creating racial hostility where none previously existed. \u201cThe government,\u201d he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a sh** about black people.\u201d In the second decade of the 21st century, Sanders has emerged as one of the most powerful single enemies of \u2013 and some would argue threat to \u2013 corporate America\u2019s influence on the wheels and gears of its political institutions. The language he uses now, bird-dogging Amazon and Disney, is remarkably unchanged from the mid-1970s, when he accused companies of \u201cblackmail\u201d for seeking out tax incentives in exchange for keeping their businesses at home. Sanders promised radical measures aimed at the pocketbooks of companies that relocated from Vermont in search of more profitable pastures. \u201cIf the banks and corporations feel that they can better exploit the people of Mississippi, New Hampshire, Hong Kong or Puerto Rico in order to make their blood profits \u2013 let them go there,\u201d Sanders said, announcing his 1976 campaign for governor. \u201cIn the Dominican Republic, American companies pay native workers $2 a day for a full day\u2019s work. Vermont is not going to compete with that kind of slavery.\u201d Sanders, in a Valley Voice story about the campaign, is quoted saying that corporations are playing one state off against the other to get the best deal. Those companies, he added, that flee Vermont for lower-wage areas should be hit with stiff penalties, including a requirement to pay the workers they left behind two years\u2019 salary and a decade of taxes to the local government. This punitive approach to outsourcing has echoed down the years. In November 2016, Sanders wrote a Medium post criticizing United Technologies, a major government contractor, for proposing to relocate manufacturing plants to Mexico. He called for the company to repay \u201ctax breaks and other corporate welfare\u201d it had received and to deny its executives bonuses, golden parachutes and stock options \u201cfor outsourcing jobs to low wage countries.\u201d Despite his commitment to democratic socialism, Sanders rarely \u2013 and even then, only with some arm-bending \u2013 engages on the nuts and bolts of the ideology that has guided him for so long. That too is a constant dating back decades. Jim Rader, his friend since the 1960s, says that Sanders has always focused on concrete steps and what he could do in the present. Bernie Sanders in 1970s Senate race called millionaire senators 'immoral' \u201cHe does feel that way\u201d about corporations and economic disparities, Rader said. \u201cAnd he always does.\u201d But in a long interview uncovered by CNN, Sanders in 1976 spoke with the Vermont Cynic, the University of Vermont student newspaper, in more philosophical, sometime spiritual terms about what he viewed as harsh remainders of consumer-driven life under an increasingly hyper-capitalist society. \u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious why kids are going to turn to drugs to get the hell out of a disgusting system or sit in front of a TV set for 60 hours a week,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that people have got to begin working with and for other people, and I think that\u2019s an extremely strong motivating factor why young people should vote for us.\u201d And while he doesn\u2019t often get into soul-searching or sociological discussions in 2019, Sanders on the trail has spoken often about what he describes as a debilitating sense of futility that has enveloped life in parts of rural and post-industrial America \u2013 particularly areas that voted heavily for Trump. The opioid epidemic, among others, he says, is one of a number of \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d threatening the country. His criticism of the media in the \u201970s also sounded very much like it does today. In an interview last October, CNN asked Sanders how he planned to compete with headline generators like Trump going forward. \u201cI made news today. I made big news today,\u201d Sanders said, frustrated by the question but eager to deliver his take. \u201cBecause I talked with four senior citizens, you were there, and one senior said that the cost of her medicine soared. Extraordinary news. Because that\u2019s news that millions of people will shake their heads at. What you mean by news is I gotta say something that I didn\u2019t say yesterday.\u201d That was 2018. At an event in 1974, Sanders asked the audience: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t television reflect the real suffering and misery of life?\u201d Sanders\u2019 worldview, colored by a swirl of empathy and ideology, is locked in. But his politics \u2013 and the language he uses to promote them \u2013 have become more polished and, on some occasions, less radical than during his first decade in Vermont. He has also since rejected a number of positions he and the party advocated for during the time, campaign communications director Arianna Jones confirmed to CNN. The push, in 1972, by Movement magazine to lower the voting age to 14 from 18 has long been discarded. Sanders no longer supports, as mentioned in the same issue, a \u201cneed to abolish compulsory education (and, perhaps, schools) so that kids can grow up with a sense of independence and strength rather than as cogs in this great bureaucratic, oppressive morass which is called America.\u201d Four years later, in his interview with the Cynic, Sanders lamented the state of American society while casting in a more forgiving light Cuba and China, which was in the final year of the Cultural Revolution. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that we\u2019ve got to unleash the energy that exists in people to start doing meaningful things,\u201d Sanders told the paper. \u201cContrast what the young people in China and Cuba are doing for themselves and for their country compared to the young people in America.\u201d Sanders has long since distanced himself from the deadly excesses of the communists dictatorships of the era. He has also dropped old calls to nationalize certain private industries and legalize all drugs, including heroin. \u201cI\u2019m not saying drug use isn\u2019t a definite problem, but making drugs illegal isn\u2019t helping solve anything,\u201d he told the Bennington Banner newspaper in 1971. \u201cIf heroin were legal, at least we\u2019d know the dimensions of the problem, and be able to deal with it rationally.\u201d Sanders can appear uncomfortable when asked about those positions today. In a CNN town hall, he bristled when anchor Chris Cuomo brought up his past support for government seizures of major American industries. \u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d Sanders asked. \u201cIn the \u201970s,\u201d Cuomo responded, before Sanders sarcastically replied, \u201cOK, right.\u201d On other points, Sanders has simply rolled back or effectively ignored his bygone dreams of a more aggressive socialist reformation. CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported that Sanders had argued for nationalization of the energy companies and the public ownership of banks, telephone, electric, and drug businesses, along with the major means of production, such as factories and other capital producers. During his 1974 Senate run, Sanders said one plan to expand government included making it illegal to gain more wealth than a person could spend in a lifetime and having a 100% tax on incomes above this level. (Sanders defined this as $1 million annually, equivalent to about $5 million today). \u201cNo fundamental change can come about in the country until the wealth and power are broken up and the people themselves direct the economy and government,\u201d Sanders said in a 1976 interview with The Valley Voice. In a gubernatorial debate that year, audio of which KFile obtained from the Vermont Historical Society, Sanders said the economy would need to be publicly owned and controlled. \u201cIn the long run, what has got to happen on the national level and on the state level is the people of this state and country have got to stand up to the 2 or 3% of the population that controls the economy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd the billions and billions and billions of dollars owned and controlled by these people have got to come within the public domain.\u201d His policies were particularly punitive toward corporations and their investors. Sanders suggested a plan to bankrupt the state\u2019s utility companies by drastically reducing their rates, thus allowing the state to swoop in and purchase their infrastructure at rock-bottom prices. At one point, he called for seizing the utilities without compensating the banks or stockholders. Apart from his electoral campaigns with Liberty Union, Sanders launched a widely reported boycott of the state\u2019s telephone company after it proposed increasing rates by 38%. When the company\u2019s general manager complained that it was \u201cgoing broke\u201d without the hike, Sanders taunted them with a donation: one dollar, which was eventually returned. Despite his frosty relationship with the state\u2019s newspapers, the Brattleboro Reformer published an editorial praising Sanders for his work opposing the new charges. Sanders would, in a statement announcing his 1976 gubernatorial bid, call for the public takeover of Vermont\u2019s telephone company, which he called \u201cprobably the single greatest rip-off company in America,\u201d and a moratorium on debt payments to New York City banks. He also pledged, according to an article in The Valley Voice, that if elected governor he would pursue legislation allowing the state to direct Vermont-based banks to invest their deposits in low-income housing construction. \u201cThere is $2 billion in Vermont banks at the present moment, and the only people who determine how that money is invested are the director of banks,\u201d Sanders said in an interview with the Voice that year. \u201cThe state and the depositors have a right to direct where that money should be invested.\u201d Sanders\u2019 initiation into electoral politics - and all the scrums that forged his public persona \u2013 began with a quiet invitation from an old friend. In 1971, Sanders, having just turned 30, was working on-and-off as a carpenter and sleeping on the couch of his friend Jim Rader, a casual Liberty Union supporter. One day, Rader says he asked Sanders to a party meeting at Goddard College. Attendees described it as a small gathering, maybe a couple dozen people in the room. Peter Diamondstone and Doris Lake, the husband-and-wife party co-founders, led the proceedings, which quickly turned to a discussion about the next year\u2019s Senate race. An incumbent senator had died and the party was looking to recruit someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 for a long-shot special election contest. \u201cI see this tousled-headed, rumpled individual, and I said, \u2018Hey you,\u2019 \u201d John Bloch, a cousin of Diamondstone\u2019s, recalled of his first encounter with Sanders. \u201cI ain\u2019t even know his name.\u201d \u201cI said we haven\u2019t got a chance in hell of winning this, but will you be the sacrificial lamb?\u201d Most members of the party at the time were young adults who couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate time to a political campaign for a party with little to no funding or campaign structure. So Sanders volunteered. \u201cWe were just hysterical laughing about this,\u201d said Rader, who drove Sanders home after the meeting. \u201cIt was an exciting novelty that he had the chutzpah to jump in there.\u201d Sanders was an unconventional candidate running on an unconventional platform. He wanted to legalize hitchhiking, which, as it happened, was often a mode of travel he used to cover the state during a campaign that would ultimately yield him 2.2% of the vote. His next five years with the party would be marked by greater success in organizing communities and developing a personal reputation around the state as its leading progressive activist. But Sanders\u2019 electoral tallies increased only marginally. After dipping to 1.1% in the 1972 gubernatorial election, he secured 4.1% of the vote in the 1974 Senate election and just surpassed 6% in the 1976 governor\u2019s race. The votes weren\u2019t there. But Sanders\u2019 prominence \u2013 and reputation as a gruff insurgent \u2013 was growing. At one 1976 event, reported on by the Burlington Free Press, Sanders, speaking to an audience of 300 teenagers and their parents with other candidates for governor, turned to the Democratic candidate, Stella Hackel, and reintroduced her as \u201ca very intelligent person and a good lawyer who once worked very hard to raise your parents\u2019 phone bills.\u201d The crowd booed and, in recounting the exchange, the Burlington Free Press likened the scene to \u201ca party where a drunken guest, for no apparent reason, has just insulted the host.\u201d Sanders continued his inflammatory speech, refusing to tone it down for the young audience. \u201cThe Liberty Union demands you do more thinking,\u201d he said, unbothered by the hostile reception. \u201cWe want you to see if what your books tell you and what your teachers tell you and what Walter Cronkite tells you may not be the whole truth.\u201d \u201cWhat people want you to be is good little boys,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s time that you stop being good little boys.\u201d Outside of his campaign activities, Sanders has remained active in the state\u2019s progressive counterculture. Movement \u2013 the Liberty Union magazine \u2013 was his megaphone and he used it to comment on contemporary economic and social issues. In a 1972 article titled \u201cNatural Childbirth in a Vermont Commune,\u201d he described witnessing a woman named Lorraine give birth in a home communal setting - and used the scene to criticize the institutional approach to hospital care for women. In an interview with the new mother, Sanders posed a series of intimate questions that might make mainstream society blush. \u201cDid you tear?\u201d he asked. No, Lorraine said, before discussing her decision to eat the afterbirth. Sanders continued: \u201cHow long after the birth did you eat the afterbirth?\u201d Lorraine answered the questions matter-of-factly (about an hour later, she said), describing how the process worked. Sanders resigned from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, the Burlington Free Press reported, telling the paper that \u201ca serious political party cannot maintain the respect of people if it simply pops up every two years for elections.\u201d \u201cWhere is the Liberty Union right now?\u201d Sanders asked a reporter sarcastically that year. \u201cIf you find it, you tell me.\u201d The Burlington Free Press described the party\u2019s inability to attract more working class voters, internal dissent over its material goals and lack of a year-round political machine as the main drivers of its thwarted ambitions. Other members, though, spoke of the immense personal and financial toll it took to run such a party with no major financial backing. Without money or success at the polls, the sacrifices were beginning to pile up. The payoffs were not. \u201cVirtually everybody in the Liberty Union is working extremely hard trying to maintain body and soul,\u201d Sanders said at the time. He also began to fall out with  Diamondstone and Lake, who prioritized the movement \u2013 and its work to shift the dynamics of the political scene \u2013 over successes at the ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, the little things that stick in my head,\u201d Lake said, describing a birthday party Sanders had after he left Liberty Union. He hadn\u2019t yet been elected mayor of Burlington. That came in March 1981. But his trajectory was clear. \u201cIt\u2019s so trivial,\u201d Lake said, \u201cbut somebody gave him some ties and shirts and there was some joking about it. You know, like, like now you\u2019re really, gone traditional.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In a bid to increase political participation and reduce the influence of big dollar donors, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday announced a new proposal to help voters contribute to federal campaigns. The plan \u2013 dubbed \u201cDemocracy Dollars\u201d \u2013 would provide $200 in vouchers per federal election to U.S. citizens over the age of 18 to spend on federal candidates of their choosing. The money would be equally divided between the primary and the general election \u2013 $100 for primary and $100 for general \u2013 and could be spent in $10 increments on eligible candidates. To receive the money, federal candidates would have to swear off donations of more than $200 from any individual donor. The plan would be paid for by eliminating a taxpayer subsidy for CEOs making 25 times the median salary of their employees or more than $1 million, whichever is less \u2013 a change they say would raise $61.9 billion more than 10 years. \u201cTo get anything done in Washington, we have to address the money and greed that corrupts politicians and prevents progress on issues like gun violence prevention, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and addressing climate change,\u201d Gillibrand said in a statement. \u201cMy Clean Elections plan is a critical structural change that gets big money and special interests out of politics and ensures that elected officials in Washington are beholden only to the people who sent them there.\u201d The first major policy announcement by Gillibrand, one of 20 contenders for the Democratic nomination, is in line with the pitch she has been making to voters at town halls and meet-and-greets in Iowa and New Hampshire about the importance of reforming the way campaigns are financed. She considers her proposal an important first step that would dramatically reduce the power of super PACs. The 2020 presidential field, by the numbers Larry Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, said Gillibrand\u2019s proposal was viable. \u201cIt gives you an incentive to talk directly to more voters. When people contribute to your campaign, it\u2019s like investing in your campaign and they\u2019re more likely to go out and vote,\u201d Noble said. Gillibrand argues the multiplier effect of the program would provide candidates with \u201cfar greater resources\u201d than what they are currently raising, which would incentivize candidates to opt in. She pointed to a similar program in Seattle that has led to three times more campaign donors in 2017 than in 2013 \u2013 most of them new contributors \u2013 that better reflected the city\u2019s age, racial and socioeconomic makeup. \u201cWhen you show in small places that it can work, it gives a lot of credibility,\u201d Noble said of Seattle\u2019s program. End Citizens United, a political action committee focused on campaign finance, also praised what it called a \u201cbold, innovative proposal\u201d that will make politicians accountable to their constituents. Gillibrand\u2019s campaign is not accepting corporate PAC money or donations from federal lobbyists and she does not have her own super PAC, but the senator came under fire for attending a March fundraiser at the home of an executive from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. She has said the executive is a friend who supports her views on LGBTQ equality.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s mission in the presidential bid he launched on Thursday is to prove he\u2019s not a man out of step with the times. He must convince a Democratic Party pulsating with forces of youth, gender and racial diversity that is moving left on health care and college funding to ultimately turn to a traditional middle-of-the road nominee to take on President Donald Trump. Biden is an aging white male, a physically expressive old-school pol with a nose for the ideological center who still believes a political opponent is not a blood enemy. And his third try to finally reach the political summit comes at the one moment in American history when such qualities have turned into liabilities. But Biden has one huge card to sell to Democrats desperate to oust Trump: He might be their best hope of beating the President, especially in the Midwestern, blue-collar heartland. And his experience and dignity could be the antidote to Trump\u2019s rage. Biden enters the crowded primary after months of soul searching as a clear but not prohibitive front-runner. Invoking America\u2019s better angels, Biden is offering experience and a character forged by tragedy to purge the scandals, lies and constitutional chicanery of the current President and to close the societal schisms he has widened. \u201cIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are and I cannot stand by and watch that happen,\u201d Biden said in a video announcing his candidacy released Thursday. \u201cThe core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America, is at stake.\u201d The 76-year-old is in a strong position in national polls and early voting states. He will run as a centrist Obama-Biden Democrat anchored by strong union support. He will lambaste Trump as a phony populist and a friend of Wall Street CEOs who hit the jackpot with the tax overhaul law. Biden\u2019s hopes may depend on the idea that working class, union Democrats and moderates in the suburbs remain the backbone of the party. Though he will also have to appeal to radical young progressives electrified by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense,\u201d Biden said last month while analyzing the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cShow me the really left-, left-, left-wingers who beat a Republican. So the idea that the Democratic Party has kind of stood on its head, I don\u2019t get.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an Obama-Biden Democrat man, and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he added. Biden will also claim progressive credentials, by pointing out his embrace of same-sex marriage before President Barack Obama \u2013 and his authorship of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. Biden must also avoid the self-sabotage that doomed his campaigns in 1988 and 2008. He needs to show the political fastball last called upon in a vice-presidential debate in 2012, which steadied Obama\u2019s suddenly wobbling re-election campaign. Biden will have to reconcile his record on criminal justice, race and America\u2019s foreign wars with a party that has changed considerably even since he left office in January 2017. Hanging over his bid is his anemic 2008 race, which he abandoned after polling less than 1% in Iowa. A strong showing in the first-in-the-nation caucus is mandatory in 2020, since Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is the reigning New Hampshire primary champion and Sen. Kamala Harris of California will test Biden\u2019s strong bonds with African Americans in South Carolina. And Biden must show he can keep pace with top rivals and their small-donor fundraising brigades. His supporters say the extreme circumstances of the Trump era cry out for his qualities. \u201cWhen Joe Biden looks in that mirror, he\u2019s not going to stop and not do this because it\u2019s going to be hard or he might lose or anything else,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, who served as Biden\u2019s chief of staff before succeeded him in the Senate. \u201cHe does it because he won\u2019t feel right about himself that he had this opportunity and I personally believe a rare opportunity and a rare time in history for someone of his background, his experience to become President of the United States.\u201d The former chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees, who was in the room for Obama\u2019s every key decision, has more experience than the Democratic field combined. He was seen as something of a punchline when he became vice president. But his loyalty, willingness to temper his political ego and safe hands on the stimulus plan and foreign policy won respect. He became beloved in the West Wing. He even cut out most of his famous gaffes \u2013 though he occasionally irked his buttoned-down boss, like when said into an open mic that passing Obamacare was a \u201cbig f***ing deal.\u201d Biden will metaphorically stand shoulder to shoulder with Obama during his campaign \u2013 given the ex-president\u2019s universal popularity among Democrats. Though Obama hailed his number two as a \u201cbrother\u201d during his farewell address, there is no sign he will endorse Biden \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 during the primary. If 2020 is about making Washington work and draining partisan poison, no one is better positioned than Biden: He even likes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. If the test is meeting the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Biden has no peer. Grief and resilience are never far from the surface in this compassionate, emotional man. He never hid his anguish over the loss of his first wife and infant daughter in 1972 and his son Beau in 2015 from brain cancer. Biden\u2019s suffering has equipped him with the kind of genuine empathy many politicians have to fake. He will stress decency, honesty and brotherly love, attributes that his supporters see personified in their candidate \u2013 and that could strike a contrast with Trump. \u201cFolks, this is not who we are,\u201d Biden said before the midterms. For better or worse, his charisma and name recognition mean he will have no trouble standing out from the Democratic crowd. He showed in 2008 that he\u2019s a formidable debater. And he\u2019s spoiling to fight Trump. Biden said last year that if the pair were in high school he would \u201cbeat the hell out of him.\u201d But the reason why some Republican strategists believe Biden could pose a strong threat is his appeal to the very voters who put Trump in the White House. His hammy fables of the loving-yet-austere upbringing of little Joey Biden in his idealized birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, are easy to mock. For years, he has dispensed hokey sayings about his mom, who he eulogized in 2010 as \u201cHeroic in her ideals but solid in her expectations,\u201d and his dad, an unlucky businessman. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I\u2019ll tell you what you value,\u201d he roars on the campaign trail, using one of Biden senior\u2019s sayings to show his understanding of the economic struggle of many Americans. Biden, still raw at the loss of Beau, couldn\u2019t bring himself to run in 2016. In retrospect, there are now many Democrats who think he would have done a better job than Hillary Clinton. He would have camped out in states like Michigan and Wisconsin where Clinton was an infrequent visitor and Trump won the economic and cultural argument. He would have pushed Trump, a New Yorker, in his native Pennsylvania. David Urban, who masterminded Trump\u2019s triumph in the Keystone State, admits Biden has appeal, though he says Clinton already failed in running for \u201cthe third term of the Obama administration.\u201d \u201cI do think that Joe Biden speaks to a demographic in America that Democrats have to win back, if they want to win the Electoral College map and all of those states kind of in the middle there, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\u201d Urban said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d this week. Biden\u2019s most obvious liability is age. As soon as he lowers his hand after taking the oath of office, the then-78-year-old Biden would be the oldest President in American history. Ronald Reagan was 77 at the end of his second term. Biden, a teetotaler who sometimes breaks into a trot before the cameras to showcase his fitness, is a well-preserved septuagenarian. And the age issue would not matter in a match-up with Trump, who\u2019s 72. But he is asking Democrats not to embrace a new generation of leadership in the primary and even to turn back the clock. The youngest Democratic candidate, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, is not even half Biden\u2019s age. It\u2019s poignant that Biden faces this question. Because he was the future once. He was a pearly toothed Democratic young gun when Delaware made him one of the youngest senators in history. Biden, captured by Richard Ben Cramer in the campaign classic \u201cWhat It Takes,\u201d was the kid who beat a paralyzing stutter to acquire a gift for gab. But his loquaciousness undid him when he had to drop out of the 1988 race after using unattributed quotes by former British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock. Amid complaints by several women in recent weeks that he had invaded their personal space, Biden\u2019s foot seemed to be back in his mouth. He joked twice about having permission to touch people before delivering a speech. Biden cannot afford to alienate female voters, given the strong sense in the party that it\u2019s a female candidate\u2019s turn again after Clinton\u2019s narrow failure to shatter the glass ceiling. He will also have to court African American women \u2013 a crucial Democratic constituency. Biden\u2019s team was warned this week not to launch his campaign on Wednesday \u2013 the same day as the She the People forum devoted to women of color. If he can deal with age and gender problems, Biden\u2019s longevity could still be an issue. He has a longer Washington record than any successful Democratic nominee for the last five decades. So he must brace for a 40-year opposition research dump. Already, Biden has been criticized for his handling of sexual harassment allegations by Anita Hill against Justice Clarence Thomas during Thomas\u2019 confirmation hearings in 1991. And his authorship of a criminal justice bill in the same decade was blamed for sparking mass incarceration \u2013 an issue especially important to African American voters. Biden admitted in January that he hadn\u2019t \u201calways been right\u201d on the issue. He\u2019s also been close to the finance industry in Delaware, a factor that could undermine his economic arguments. He voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War, another no-no for Democrats. Then again, so did Clinton. And his record of reaching across the aisle could antagonize liberals fulminating against Republicans. Earlier this year he called Vice President Mike Pence a \u201cdecent guy,\u201d sparking a backlash from his left.",

And like Atlantis, no one could. Sure, Barack Obama galvanized young people in 2008 and, to a lesser extent, 2012. But that felt like a personality-driven movement, as young people viewed Obama as their generation\u2019s John F. Kennedy. Without another Obama waiting in the wings, it was hard to see young people being so involved again. All of which makes what happened in the 2018 midterm election so interesting. According to data published today by the Census Bureau, the prime driver of the record turnout in last November\u2019s election was voters aged 18-29. \u201cAmong 18- to 29-year-olds, voter turnout went from 20% in 2014 to 36% in 2018, the largest percentage point increase for any age group \u2014 a 79% jump,\u201d wrote Census\u2019s Jordan Misra. 79%! That mattered \u2013 hugely \u2013 because of how overwhelmingly young voters backed Democratic House candidates.\u00a0 Voters under 30 voted 67%-35% for Democratic candidates over Republican ones, according to 2018 exit polling. That was, by far, the biggest gap \u2013 for either party \u2013 among any age group.

(Interesting sidebar: For all of the talk of the surge of female voters in 2018, turnout increased roughly similarly from 2014 to 2018 among women, 12%, and men \u2013 11%). On its face, that should worry Republicans. A Pew poll released earlier this year showed that millennials and Gen Z members are significantly more liberal \u2013 across the board \u2013 than members of older generations.\u00a0 Seven in 10 members of Gen Z (those born after 1996) believe government should do more to solve people\u2019s problems; 64% of millennials said the same. More than 6 in 10 in both generations said the increasingly ethnic and racial diversity in the country is good for society. The Point: What motivated such a big youth turnout in 2018? My guess is Donald Trump. Who, yes, will be on the ballot again next November.",

            "article_content": "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who is proudly running for President with a laser-like focus on climate change, entered the CNN town hall stage on Wednesday with a goal: Let voters know that he has a broader record than the key issue he has staked his campaign on. The Democrat launched his campaign last month, honing in on climate change and talking about it at every turn. But on Wednesday, Inslee sought to expand on his other stances as he worked to convince voters to donate to his campaign and get him on the primary debate stage this summer. Inslee, who comfortably parried questions from CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer during the town hall, removed his glasses near the end of the hour-long event to make the point that climate changes matters and the best way to make sure the 2020 nominating fight focuses on the issue is by helping him meet the DNC standards \u2013 65,000 individual donors and a polling threshold \u2013 so he can participate in the Democratic Party primary debates. Inslee did not mince words when asked about how he would combat political inaction on climate change. \u201cWe are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last generation, literally, who can do something about it,\u201d the governor said. The book that fueled Inslee's climate crusade Inslee said, in order to take action, he would push to get rid of the filibuster in the Senate if he wins the presidency, believing that it is the largest impediment to passing health care reform and climate change legislation. Inslee was one of the earliest candidates to support getting rid of the Senate rule, which requires legislation to have the support of 60 senators before it can be voted on. \u201cWe are not going to be able to get health care done \u2013 or anything else for that matter \u2013 unless we get rid of the filibuster,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIf the filibuster is still in Mitch McConnell\u2019s hand come 2021, all hope is sort of down the tubes to be able to do real significant reform. So, I\u2019m telling you, if I\u2019m given this highest honor, I will lead the charge to end this senatorial privilege, which is an ancient artifact of a bygone era in time, and let\u2019s get some health care reform and climate change legislation and reform the United States of America.\u201d Inslee, unlike some 2020 candidates, has been in public life for upwards of 40 years. In that time, as governor and a congressman from Washington, Inslee has taken positions that he now says he regrets. One of those is his support for the 1994 crime bill, a now controversial piece of legislation that included stiffer penalties for drug crimes and contributed to the massive incarcerations of people of color. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for the bill as first lady was a constant knock against her 2016 campaign and the bill still looms large in 2020, especially if Joe Biden, the bill\u2019s author, enters the presidential race. \u201cListen, that was a situation where many Democrats, including myself, believed we needed some response to the epidemic of crime at the time. But I will tell you that \u2013 this, if I knew then what I know now, I would not have cast that vote. It has resulted in racial disparities in our system,\u201d he said. President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law in 1994. The legislation included the federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision and mandating life sentences for criminals convicted of a violent felony after two or more prior convictions, including drug crimes. Although Inslee said he regretted his vote on the 1994 crime bill, he also said Wednesday that he did not regret his vote in favor of the assault weapons ban that the same year, despite the fact that he believes he lost his congressional seat because of it. Inslee was a freshman lawmaker representing eastern Washington in 1994 when he voted for the assault weapons ban. Inslee said Wednesday that he was told he would lose his seat if he voted in favor of the bill, but he opted to do it anyway. \u201cI voted for that bill. I provided one of the critical votes to get it over the top and I lost my seat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never regretted that vote. Because I do not believe any congressman\u2019s or politician\u2019s seat is more important than any child\u2019s life. And I fundamentally believe that.\u201d Despite losing re-election during what came to be known as the Republican Revolution in 1994, Inslee would return to the House in 1999 and become Washington\u2019s governor in 2013. Inslee spent little time on Wednesday focused on his fellow Democrats running for President. Instead, the Washington governor looked past the nominating fight and directed most of his fire at President Donald Trump, drawing a distinction with the Republican president as much as he could. Inslee said he would have grounded the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes sooner if he were president, as significant comment because Boeing is based in Washington. \u201cThis has been a painful thing for the people who make these airplanes. But I have to tell you, I would have grounded these jets much sooner. And don\u2019t hold me totally to this because I didn\u2019t have all of the briefing. But I would have been given serious consideration to grounding them after the first loss,\u201d he said. On foreign policy, Inslee said he would \u201chave a diametrically opposed position\u201d to Trump, whom he described as someone who views foreign policy as a zero-sum game. \u201cHe has a worldview\u2026 of thinking that for him to win, somebody else has to lose,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cAnd I really believe he extends that to our international policies.\u201d He added: \u201cSo the only way he believes America can succeed is if another country somehow is subjugated or loses some treaty right. That\u2019s a dangerous policy. It has damaged us in our international relations.\u201d Despite the constant contrast with Trump, Inslee said on Wednesday that he supports voting Trump out of office in 2020, not impeaching him \u2013 at this time. Inslee said he is as angry as anyone about some of Trump\u2019s decisions, but he added that he thinks the most fruitful way for Democrats to oust Trump is at the ballot box. \u201cI believe the current situation right now is that we should have a dramatic, engaged, concerted, energetic and successful effort on November 2020 to make Donald Trump a blip in history,\u201d Inslee said. \u201c\u2026 Because filing articles of impeachment, as you know, doesn\u2019t solve the trick. You have to have conviction in the Senate.\u201d He added: \u201cSo for my money at the moment, we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, which is to get ready to remove this person from this high office.\u201d Still, Inslee didn\u2019t say he would never support impeachment, noting that not everything about Trump is currently known. \u201cFor instance, we just discovered a black hole. Did you see the picture the first black hole?\u201d Inslee said. \u201cWe think Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns are in there. We need those tax returns.\u201d In one of the more curious moments of the night, Inslee \u2013 a candidate whose campaign is almost entirely focused on climate change \u2013 said he didn\u2019t know enough about the recycling system to say how he would change it. \u201cI thought I had the answers to every question and I don\u2019t have (an) answer to that. But next time we meet, I\u2019m going to have a better approach. I know that I have a team of people who are looking for options on this. We know how important this is,\u201d he said. He went on to say that companies need to stop making products that have to recycled and said that he would support \u201credesigning our systems, our packaging systems.\u201d But at no point did Inslee actually answer the question.",

            "article_content": "A new fight has erupted in the battle over big money in the 2020 White House election: Outside groups that support candidates of color are warning that calls for presidential contenders to disavow super PACs risk cutting off a crucial avenue for engaging minority voters. \u201cWe agree that money in politics is a problem,\u201d said Quentin James, the co-founder of The Collective PAC, a super PAC that has supported African-American candidates. \u201cBut the way to solve that is not to put our hands behind our backs and try to fight this battle in 2020.\u201d The pushback comes as the crowded Democratic field faces pressure from progressives to take stands to keep special-interest money out of the Democratic nomination process. Most of the 2020 candidates have rejected money from corporate PACs, and many have said they do not want single-candidate super PACs engaged in their races. One contender, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has gone further, refusing to even attend high-dollar fundraisers. Super PACs, a byproduct of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision and a related appeals court ruling, can raise money from virtually any source, including corporations, but they are barred from coordinating the spending with the candidates they support. Their power was on display in the 2018 election: Just 10 mega-donors contributed a combined $436 million to influence federal races, a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics shows. By contrast, an individual cannot donate more than $2,800 directly to a candidate for the primary or general election in 2020. James said trying to root out super PACs that support individual candidates ignores the reality some candidates of color face: They don\u2019t have access to traditional pools of donors or long experience building digital programs to reach grassroots contributors. His group and its arms raised a collective $6.5 million in recent years and provided early backing to Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum \u2013 the 2018 gubernatorial candidates in Georgia and Florida, respectively. Abrams and Gillum took on establishment candidates to win their primaries and became the first black gubernatorial nominees in their states. They lost in the general election. The 2020 field includes two black US senators, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen. Cory Booker, along with a Latino contender, former House and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. All have said they do not want super PACs engaged in their races, although a Booker ally, San Francisco lawyer Steve Phillips, has launched one. Harris, the second black woman elected to the US Senate, has reported raising a solid $12 million during the first fundraising quarter of the year. But she was outraised by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who built a massive small-donor base during his 2016 presidential bid. Sanders raised $18.2 million in 41 days. On Sunday, Booker announced he raised $5 million during the first quarter \u2014 a number that puts him behind fundraising leaders. Castro has not released his totals but told CNN on Friday that he had not yet met the 65,000-donor threshold to join the early Democratic Party debates. New Democratic Party rules set minimum polling and donor requirements for candidates to qualify for the first two presidential debates this summer. Only a tiny fraction of Americans donates to politicians in the first place. A little more than 1.5 million people gave more than $200 to federal candidates during last year\u2019s midterm elections \u2013 or less than half of 1% of the US population, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. African Americans are an important voting bloc for Democrats. They accounted for nearly one in four voters who participated in Democratic primaries or caucuses in 2016, according to a CNN analysis of entrance and exit polls in 27 states. But the racial wealth gap \u2013 white households have about 6.5 times the wealth of black households \u2013 means fewer African Americans have the tradition of contributing money to candidates, said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, the co-founder of Higher Heights. Higher Heights operates a political action committee that supports black women running for office. \u201cWhen you have donors who don\u2019t have this institutional habit of giving politically \u2013 whether they are giving $5 a month or maxed-out checks \u2013 it makes the whole process of being able to fund candidates who will carry the voices of candidates of color forward, that much harder,\u201d she told CNN. Disavowing super PACs and other outside groups could set \u201cup yet another barrier\u201d for qualified candidates of color, Peeler-Allen said. But rejecting big money in politics increasingly has become a litmus test for progressives in the Democratic Party. Nine liberal groups last month issued an open letter to the 2020 Democratic presidential field, urging all candidates to reject candidate-specific super PACs. \u201cSingle-candidate super PACs fundamentally take power and influence away from everyday people and put it in the hands of big-money donors,\u201d according to the letter. Signatories included the watchdog group Public Citizen and End Citizens United, a group dedicated to overturning the 2010 ruling. James and his wife, Stefanie Brown James, who co-founded The Collective PAC, have released their own open letter in response and have asked the progressive groups to withdraw their demands. \u201cOne of the few sources of funding for the work to engage voters of color and support candidates of color has come from super PACs,\u201d they wrote. Politico first reported on the Collective PAC\u2019s letter. Taking the moral high ground on money \u201csounds cool in a campaign speech,\u201d James told CNN. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening day-to-day. That\u2019s not how we were able to help Andrew (Gillum) win his primary.\u201d Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokesman for End Citizens United, said his group objects to single-candidate super PACs because they can \u201cact as a shadow arm\u201d of a campaign, allowing candidates to circumvent federal donation limits. He signaled that his group would not object to outside political organizations working on broader issues, such as voter outreach. \u201cWe believe voter engagement, registration, and turnout in communities of color is fundamentally important to a Democrat\u2019s ability to be successful in 2020,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cAll candidates need to work and dedicate resources to build long-lasting relationships in communities of color.\u201d Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, said the real solution is to \u201cdemocratize the funding\u201d for all candidates by publicly financing campaigns and encouraging small-dollar contributions. \u201cSuper PACs are not a democratizing force,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are an expression of the political power of concentrated wealth.\u201d This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that he was unaware when he said \u201call lives matter\u201d in 2015 that the phrase was being used to undercut the Black Lives Matter movement. Buttigieg spoke about his past comment after a speech at the National Action Network, a politically powerful organization founded by Rev. Al Sharpton. The phrase \u201call lives matter\u201d has been used by critics of the Black Lives Matter movement to push back on the view that closer attention needs to be paid to the deaths of African American men and women at the hand of law enforcement. \u201cAt that time, I was talking about a lot of issues around racial reconciliation in our community. What I did not understand at that time, was that phrase, just early into mid-2015, was coming to be viewed as a sort of counter slogan to Black Lives Matter,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd so, this statement, that seems very anodyne and something that nobody could be against, actually wound up being used to devalue what the Black Lives Matter movement was telling us.\u201d Buttigieg has 'enormous respect' for Hillary Clinton, says she was 'ill-served' by strategy, media environment in 2016 He added: \u201cThat is the contribution of Black Lives Matter and it\u2019s a reason why, since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism, I\u2019ve stopped using it in that context.\u201d Buttigieg, who launched a presidential exploratory committee earlier this year, said \u201call lives matter\u201d during his 2015 State of the City speech. \u201cThere is no contradiction between respecting the risks that police officers take every day in order to protect this community, and recognizing the need to overcome the biases implicit in a justice system that treats people from different backgrounds differently, even when they are accused of the same offenses,\u201d Buttigieg said then. \u201cWe need to take both those things seriously, for the simple and profound reason that all lives matter.\u201d Lis Smith, the mayor\u2019s spokeswoman, defended the comment, saying it was made \u201cin the context of discussing racial reconciliation in his 2015 State of the City speech.\u201d \u201cHe believes black lives matter and that has been reflected in his actions as mayor of South Bend,\u201d Smith said. Some politicians got themselves into political trouble during the 2016 election for saying \u201call lives matter.\u201d Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley was booed at the liberal Netroots Nation conference in 2015 for saying \u201call lives matter\u201d and the 2016 candidate would later apologize for the \u201cmistake.\u201d Hillary Clinton, the eventual nominee, also made the mistake when she retold a lesson she learned from her mother. \u201cI asked her, \u2018What kept you going?\u2019 Her answer was very simple,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cKindness along the way from someone who believed she mattered. All lives matter.\u201d Buttigieg used his speech before the National Action Network on Thursday to both tout what he did as mayor of South Bend to combat police brutality and officer involved shootings, while also acknowledging that he had to learn things \u201cthe hard way\u201d in his first term as mayor. National Action Network\u2019s ongoing three-day conference in New York this week is drawing a dozen declared Democratic candidates for President, including former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris, and is widely seen as a powerful avenue for courting the African American vote, a demographic that is likely to make up a bulk of voters in the Democratic primary. \u201cSome of the things I have learned about criminal justice reform \u2026 these are things we learn the hard way in our community, especially early in my term,\u201d Buttigieg said. Buttigieg said his policy for lifting up African American communities would focus on home ownership, entrepreneurship, education, health and justice. \u201cThe idea that a rising tide lifts all boats just isn\u2019t true. Not when some of those boats are still roped down on the ocean floor,\u201d Buttigieg said, after describing South Bend as a \u201cracially diverse and largely low-income city, but also a beautiful and generous city\u201d where his government has \u201cworked hard to address the racial inequities that hold us back from being the city we wish to be.\u201d",

            "article_content": "During a stop last month in South Carolina, his first in the key primary state since announcing his bid for president, Sen. Cory Booker urgently wanted to talk about public schools. He was in one, first of all \u2013 sitting on a stage in the Fairfield Central High School cafeteria, in Winnsboro. But Booker also kicked off the forum with local leaders with a rallying cry around support for public education. \u201cI\u2019m one of those folks who is really worrying that public education is moving backwards now and under assault, and being starved of resources,\u201d said the New Jersey politician, \u201cand that now the kind of education you get often depends on your zip code or how wealthy your family is.\u201d The setting and Booker\u2019s remarks stood out given his past advocacy for school choice and public charter schools \u2013 longtime third rails in Democratic politics due to the influence of teachers unions that oppose them. Now, these forces stand to complicate Booker\u2019s chances in the primary. Booker is not renouncing his history as a cheerleader for those policies, a central part of his story as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. But he isn\u2019t exactly highlighting it, either \u2013 reflecting the highly charged politics around education. Booker \u201cis kind of caught between a rock and a hard place right now,\u201d said Jon Valant, an education fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIn the race to claim the mantle of progressive Democrat, it is not helpful to be ID\u2019ed as a supporter of school choice reforms.\u201d But Booker \u201chas been the Democratic darling of the charter school movement for a decade,\u201d Valant added. \u201cIf he starts to distance himself from charter schools and school choice reforms, he would be essentially distancing himself from his record in Newark.\u201d Six takeaways from Cory Booker's CNN town hall Booker attempted to walk that political tightrope Wednesday in a CNN town hall in Orangeburg, South Carolina, where he was questioned about his support for charter schools and school choice, as well as his past association with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. \u201cI fought for excellent schools no matter, whether they were magnet schools, charter schools,\u201d Booker said, maneuvering away from any mention of DeVos. \u201cIn fact, I fought to close low-performing charter schools \u2026 We created schools that worked.\u201d Pressed by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon about whether charter schools operate at the expense of traditional public schools, however, Booker offered that some \u201ccharter school laws \u2026 are written in ways that really do hurt public education.\u201d Booker added, \u201cLocal leaders need to find the best solutions for public education that work for them.\u201d On the day before Booker launched his campaign, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who teamed up with Booker to push for and implement changes to the education system in Newark, seemed to wink at the thorny politics Booker stood to face on education \u2013 praising his \u201cfriend\u201d as \u201csomeone who was pro-voucher, he was pro-charter school.\u201d \u201cIf he stays in that lane, and is the articulate, inspirational guy that he is,\u201d Christie added slyly, \u201cthen I think he\u2019s got a legitimate chance to be a serious potential problem for (President Donald Trump) in the general election.\u201d Two months later, education policy is already playing a prominent role in the Democratic primary. This week, California Sen. Kamala Harris unveiled as her first major campaign policy proposal a plan to increase teacher pay across the country, spending $315 billion over 10 years. Booker is acutely aware of the political minefield he must navigate over education. At a Democrats for Education Reform event held around the party\u2019s 2008 national convention, Booker recounted being \u201cliterally tarred and feathered\u201d when he \u201ctalked about school choice.\u201d \u201cI was literally brought into a broom closet by a union and told I would never win office if I kept talking about charters,\u201d Booker said. It speaks volumes then that, the week of his campaign launch, Booker reached out to Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the second largest teachers union in the country. \u201cWe have promised that we will talk to each other,\u201d Weingarten told CNN regarding their conversation. Weingarten and Booker have \u201cbutted heads at times, worked together at times,\u201d she said \u2013 dating back to when Booker was mayor and Weingarten was president of the United Federation of Teachers across the river in New York City. But, Weingarten added, \u201cI think we have more respect for each other today than we did when he was mayor of Newark.\u201d Notably, she is reserving judgment on his presidential campaign, explaining, \u201cPast is prologue, but prologue is the beginning, not the end.\u201d \u201cInstead of saying that what his positions have been before should disqualify him, let\u2019s see how he answers these questions and what he does as he\u2019s running for office,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cIf he is where he was years ago, then it will be a problem.\u201d Public education is central to the story Booker is telling Democratic voters about himself and what he envisions for the country. In his campaign launch video, Booker describes his family\u2019s struggle to move \u201cinto a neighborhood with great public schools,\u201d where \u201crealtors wouldn\u2019t sell us a home because of the color of our skin.\u201d \u201cAs the product of great New Jersey public schools, Cory is driven to help every kid have the same opportunity he did to get an outstanding public education,\u201d campaign spokesman Jeff Giertz said. Some detractors believe Booker\u2019s focus on public schools is the stuff of revisionist history. John Abeigon, president of the Newark Teachers Union, literally laughed at the idea that Booker would be a champion for public schools as president. \u201cThat\u2019s priceless,\u201d Abeigon said, catching his breath. \u201cDuring his tenure in Newark, he did everything possible to destroy the public schools. Hasn\u2019t done anything to help them since.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sad and disappointing, because I\u2019m a Newarker born and raised, but God help the traditional public schools in this country if he becomes president,\u201d Abeigon added. Cory Booker's blend of personal and political could catch fire As Newark mayor, Booker spearheaded ambitious policies that cut against the partisan grain \u2013 by pushing to close underperforming schools, expand successful public charter schools, tie teacher pay to performance and implement a universal enrollment system. Such seismic changes to the status quo were bound to be controversial \u2013 and some of Booker\u2019s advisers initially counseled him against taking on changes to the education system, said Chris Cerf, a former state Education Commissioner, and later, Newark schools superintendent. But Booker ultimately wasn\u2019t fazed by the possible political backlash, Cerf said. \u201cCory looked at this and said we can\u2019t be anything other than brave.\u201d In a September 2010 interview with Oprah, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he planned to donate $100 million to support Christie\u2019s and Booker\u2019s efforts to \u201cturn Newark into a symbol of educational excellence for the whole nation.\u201d Christie touted the opportunity to create a \u201cnational model\u201d for education. Today, Booker downplays that branding \u2013 stressing that the policies he pushed were a unique solution to a unique problem, not necessarily a template for his education agenda as president. Unlike in Newark, charter schools represent only a small fraction of public schools across the country, Booker told CNN last month. \u201cI\u2019m running for president of the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cMy goal is to make sure that every child and every kid has a great public school to go to.\u201d The story of Booker\u2019s education intervention is a positive one in many respects, but complicated. As Booker conceded in an interview last fall with education policy website The 74, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a disconnect between a popular understanding and the data.\u201d Much of the popular understanding has been shaped by \u201cThe Prize,\u201d the 2015 book by Dale Russakoff, a veteran education reporter. The book presents a portrait of deeply flawed and disruptive policies, implemented in a top-down fashion without buy-in from the community. \u201cCertainly the perception since then has been that the reforms were a failure, and that there were limited to no gains,\u201d said Jesse Margolis, a founder and partner of MarGrady Research, an education consulting firm. Margolis has analyzed data on Newark public school enrollment and student test scores from 2006, well before the policies were conceived, through 2018. Consistent with the framing in \u201cThe Prize,\u201d Margolis observed a period of disruption following the initial changes, reflected in a dip in student achievement. But since 2014, the numbers have told a different story, with all Newark public school students showing significant gains in achievement relative to districts with comparable socioeconomic conditions. Newark charter school students, in particular, now score on average relative to the entire state. \u201cThis data is sufficient to put to rest the argument that Newark is doing no better now than 10 years ago,\u201d Margolis said. Margolis\u2019 findings are echoed by a 2017 Harvard study, which looked at students in grades four through eight, starting two years before the policy changes, in 2009, through the 2015-16 school year. The Harvard analysis found that the biggest driver of student achievement growth was one of the most controversial elements of the policy rollout: closing underperforming public schools and shifting students to higher-performing public schools, primarily public charters. \u201cI would call it a success,\u201d Thomas Kane, one of the Harvard professors who conducted the study, said of the changes made in Newark. \u201cSome folks in Newark might not call it a success. But I would call it a success that students did shift toward schools with faster achievement growth. There were more kids in more effective schools.\u201d In Mason City, Iowa, last month, at Booker\u2019s first stop in the state following his campaign launch, a woman named Norma Everest started off with praise for Booker on education, saying, \u201cI appreciate the turnaround of Newark\u2019s failing school system with charter schools.\u201d \u201cBut I ask about your commitment to work for excellent public education to include all children of racial and socioeconomic lines and disabilities,\u201d Everest continued, \u201cas opposed to (Education Secretary) Betsy DeVos, who knows little about public education and wants vouchers to separate wealthy and poor.\u201d Booker responded with a plug for locally-driven policymaking: \u201cOne-size-fits-all we know doesn\u2019t work for everybody. The federal government shouldn\u2019t be telling local folks what to do.\u201d Cory Booker is using an Oscar-nominated documentary to boost his 2020 bid As he unspooled the rest of his answer, however, Booker delicately avoided acknowledging DeVos, a former policy ally and now a possible albatross around his neck. Both Booker and DeVos previously sat on the board of the Alliance for School Choice; the group was an earlier iteration of the American Federation for Children, which DeVos chaired. Forging such unorthodox partnerships has been a hallmark of Booker\u2019s approach not only to education policy, but politics more broadly. In 2000, as a Newark City Councilman, Booker delivered a speech to the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, in which he praised charter schools, school choice and vouchers. The remarks made Booker \u201ca pariah in Democratic circles for taking on thepParty orthodoxy on education,\u201d he told Russakoff in a 2014 interview. He also became an attraction for \u201call these Republican donors and donors from outside Newark,\u201d he said, \u201cmany of them motivated because we have an African-American urban Democrat telling the truth about education.\u201d Then Booker teamed up with Christie. Oprah marveled during their education policy rollout that the two men were \u201cputting politics aside\u201d to help turn around Newark\u2019s failing schools. Even as a senator, Booker has found common purpose with Republicans on education policy \u2013 including former House Speaker John Boehner, who, along with Booker, backed vouchers for Washington, DC, schools. After Booker opposed DeVos for Education Secretary in 2017, however, some wondered whether he was turning over a new, more partisan leaf in preparation for a presidential campaign. \u201cI haven\u2019t changed one iota,\u201d Booker told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper at the time. Booker was even more blunt in a response to New Jersey newspaper Star-Ledger: \u201cPolitics be damned. It\u2019s about doing the right thing.\u201d Evolving on education policy is something of a rite of passage for Democrats running for president \u2013 from John Kerry, to Barack Obama, to Hillary Clinton. Some 2020 Democrats are already well into the process of overhauling their stances. Take Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In her 2003 book \u201cThe Two Income Trap,\u201d co-written with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, Warren touted public school vouchers as a system that would empower parents. \u201cUltimately, an all-voucher system would diminish the distinction between public and private schools, as parents were able to exert more direct control over their children\u2019s schools,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201c\u2026 An all-voucher system might be a shock to the educational system, but that shakeout might be just what the system needs.\u201d More recently, however, Warren has shifted her position; in 2016, she opposed a Massachusetts effort to raise the cap on charter schools in the state. Booker might be sanding off the rough edges of his rhetoric around education policy. Over the past few years, he has shifted focus to supporting measures compatible with the traditional Democratic Party line, including the STRIVE Act, a proposal to forgive student loans for teachers and increase funding for teacher training. But he does not appear poised for a wholesale overhaul, even in the face of stiff political headwinds. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to negotiate that,\u201d Cerf said. \u201cBut I know what he believes in, and I\u2019ve seen him take the heat and stick to his beliefs.\u201d Booker might not be alone in approaching education policy differently in this primary. Sen. Michael Bennet, who as Denver schools superintendent previously oversaw changes similar to those in Newark, is currently testing the waters for a presidential bid. Meanwhile, there could be opportunity to persuade Democratic voters, many of whom have not formed a strong opinion on these issues, Valant said. \u201cIf there\u2019s someone who\u2019s going to be able to articulate the case for charters and reforms in Newark successfully,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s going to be Cory Booker.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday lambasted the handling of \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s case as \u201can absolute embarrassment to our country\u201d and reiterated that he has asked federal authorities to review the case. \u201cI think the case in Chicago is an absolute embarrassment to our country and I have asked that it be \u2013 that they look at it,\u201d Trump told reporters on the White House lawn as he left for a political rally. \u201cSomebody has to at least take a very good hard look.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments on Smollett\u2019s case come as his 2020 re-election campaign is shifting into high gear and he seeks to highlight issues that animate his base. While campaigning during the 2018 midterm elections, Trump sparked a national debate when he slammed NFL players as unpatriotic for kneeling during the National Anthem as a protest against racial inequality in the US justice system. Trump announced earlier Thursday that the Justice Department would review Smollett\u2019s case after conservatives decried a prosecutor\u2019s decision Tuesday to unexpectedly drop all charges against the actor, who was accused of staging a hate crime against himself in Chicago. \u201cFBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday morning. \u201cIt is an embarrassment to our Nation!\u201d The Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment when asked about the President\u2019s tweet. The prosecutor who dropped Jussie Smollett's charges says he believes the actor lied to the police Smollett went to police in January claiming he had been attacked by two men who tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, used racial and homophobic slurs, and shouted, \u201cThis is MAGA country,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. Initially reacting to Smollett\u2019s claims, Trump denounced the alleged attack, as others did, telling reporters in January, \u201cI think that\u2019s horrible. It doesn\u2019t get worse as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d But after Chicago police investigated, they alleged that Smollett had hired two men to stage the attack, though those charges were dropped by a prosecutor Tuesday. On the day Smollett was arrested, Trump tweeted, \u201cWhat about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments?\u201d CNN\u2019s Laura Jarrett contributed to this report. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Watch a full report on how Cory Booker is using an Oscar-nominated documentary in his presidential race on CNN\u2019s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer at 5 p.m. ET. As he introduces himself to voters on the 2020 campaign trail, Sen. Cory Booker has a powerful tool most others don\u2019t: an Oscar-nominated documentary. \u201cStreet Fight\u201d chronicles Booker\u2019s 2002 underdog race for mayor of Newark against longtime incumbent Sharpe James and his political machine \u2013 a bid that he lost in a stinging defeat. Now, more than a decade after its original release date, the film has become a key part of Booker\u2019s playbook as he looks to build support in his campaign for president. In an email the day after Booker\u2019s launch last month, his team encouraged supporters to \u201ccheck out \u2018Street Fight.\u2019\u201d On the campaign trail, a plug for the film has become a regular feature of Booker\u2019s stump speech. CNN to host 2020 presidential town hall with Cory Booker next week Booker isn\u2019t alone in promoting the documentary. On a recent morning in Iowa, Booker headlined an event for a local state Senate candidate, Eric Giddens \u2014 who, as it turned out, was a fan of the film. \u201cI watched that years ago before I ran for school board here in Cedar Falls, and it inspired me to go for it and put myself out there in a way that I hadn\u2019t really done at that point,\u201d Giddens told Booker, with a crowd of supporters looking on. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen that film, people in the room,\u201d Giddens added, turning his focus back to the crowd, \u201cI recommend it. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d \u201cStreet Fight\u201d is far from the first or last political documentary of its kind. It\u2019s an heir to \u201cThe War Room,\u201d the D.A. Pennebaker film that chronicled Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign for president with fly-on-the-wall footage. A more recent example, \u201cMitt,\u201d offered a humanizing portrait of Mitt Romney during his 2008 and 2012 presidential bids. Still, it\u2019s unusual that a presidential hopeful would begin his race with such a film credit \u2014 and in this Democratic primary, there are two such candidates. \u201cRunning With Beto,\u201d which follows former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke during his unsuccessful Senate campaign in 2018, debuted at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin this month to rave reviews. It will begin airing in May on HBO. Booker\u2019s 2002 campaign is not nearly as fresh in the minds of Democratic voters as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u2013 if they even know about it in the first place. The New Jersey senator still intends to leverage it for his presidential bid, though. Part of the appeal of \u201cStreet Fight,\u201d Booker believes, is the \u201cpurity\u201d it depicts \u2013 of \u201ca young man trying to make a difference in the world\u201d against powerful forces and steep odds. Booker and his allies also hope \u201cStreet Fight\u201d will answer two questions central to his candidacy that could very well make it or break it: Is he tough enough to take on Trump? And is this guy for real? For Lynn Rankin, the film satisfied both concerns. Rankin, an Iowa neurologist and would-be caucusgoer, had supported former Vice President Joe Biden in the past, but wanted to take measure of the new crop of candidates. She attended a Booker event in Des Moines last month, during his first swing through the state as a candidate. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know much of anything about Cory Booker,\u201d Rankin said, \u201cexcept that he was from Newark and senator.\u201d At the event, however, Booker urged the crowd to watch \u201cStreet Fight\u201d \u2013 and Rankin took him up on it, later screening the film at home with her husband and college-aged daughter. \u201cWe were pretty much all in after that,\u201d she said. Rankin now plans to volunteer for Booker\u2019s campaign in Iowa. Incidentally, Booker faced some of the same questions and challenges in his first race for mayor as he does today, albeit in a different context. Raised in the suburbs and educated at Stanford, Oxford and Yale, Booker\u2019s rivals raised questions about his motives and authenticity in moving to the inner city of Newark and running for office there. It wasn\u2019t a subtle jab: the Democratic incumbent, James, ran on the slogan \u201cThe Real Deal.\u201d Booker\u2019s former campaign manager Van Parish recalled the narrative: \u201cThere\u2019s no way this guy can be all the things that he says is.\u201d \u201c\u2026The irony and the disappointment and the challenge and the frustration that he had was, \u2018How do I prove to you who I am?\u2019\u201d Booker was challenged to run a positive campaign against a rival who used brazen intimidation tactics and offensive attacks \u2013 in one instance, questioning Booker\u2019s racial identity and using a homophobic slur \u2013 designed to stoke division. \u201cWe were running against a guy who saw that this was a new way and was very intimidated by it,\u201d Parish said. \u201cSo he turned to the thing that he knew best, which was bullying, intimidation \u2013 a lot of the themes that we see today.\u201d In a memorable scene in the film, Booker wrestles with how to respond to a negative attack by James. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose this race because we\u2019re afraid to punch Sharpe in the nose,\u201d Booker says in the scene. \u201cI just think that there\u2019s a way to do it with dignity.\u201d Marshall Curry, the filmmaker behind \u201cStreet Fight,\u201d said he believes that scene \u201cencapsulates Cory really well.\u201d \u201cHe understands that politics are about struggle and they\u2019re about pushing back and fighting and but he also has this kind of fundamental idealism about people, and kind of natural decency,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he likes to fight\u2026.He\u2019d much prefer to convert people than to than to knock them down.\u201d As in 2002, Booker has pledged to run a relentlessly positive and unifying campaign for president \u2013 but, he has stressed, not to the exclusion of being politically tough. \u201cThere is nobody in this race tougher than me,\u201d Booker has said, pointing to his first race for mayor. \u201cIf (Booker) ends up running against Donald Trump, the things that he\u2019s learned from running against Sharpe James are gonna come in handy,\u201d said Curry, \u201cbecause those two guys are are very similar characters.\u201d Booker likes to say that he earned his B.A. from Stanford, but his Ph.D from the streets of Newark, a nod to his political education in Brick City, including his 2002 campaign for mayor, that\u2019s now informing his presidential campaign. \u201cI\u2019m a retail political guy. You win elections by going door to door, handshake to handshake, standing in living rooms. In many ways, this was the best training ground for what I\u2019m going now,\u201d Booker told CNN last week, during a campaign swing through South Carolina. \u201cThis is the kind of campaign that I love.\u201d But Booker can\u2019t knock on every door in a national election, even in a state like Iowa that puts a premium on retail politics. \u201cStreet Fight\u201d might be his best substitute. \u201cI think his team feels like, if we can just get people to meet him through that film and to see him before there were television cameras everywhere, when he was 32 and an unknown city councilman, just spend 90 minutes with him and see what he was like, that you will start to see him today in a different way,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt becomes, I\u2019m sure they think, the equivalent of him going and knocking on your door and having a conversation with you about what\u2019s really in his heart and who he really is.\u201d That concept isn\u2019t exactly new. During the 1996 Republican primary, Lamar Alexander\u2019s campaign sent 10,000 VHS tapes to New Hampshire voters, featuring a 12-minute video about the candidate. But a documentary, over which the candidate has no editorial control, is different and arguably more powerful. Speaking with CNN, Booker joked that \u201cthere are some scenes I wish I could take out\u201d of \u201cStreet Fight.\u201d Still, the film presents an overwhelmingly positive view of Booker. In its original review of the film, the New York Times dubbed it \u201ca 90-minute valentine\u201d to Booker. Jerry Crawford, a veteran Iowa Democratic operative who has been informally advising Booker, was first made aware of the film by his son a few years ago. After he watched it, he was sold \u2013 and began to spread the word. \u201cI sort of made everyone at my office watch it,\u201d Crawford said with a laugh. Booker\u2019s candidacy seems to be reviving interest in \u201cStreet Fight.\u201d Although Netflix does not disclose its viewing data, Curry says he has seen an uptick in views through Amazon, iTunes and his own website. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot more than three years ago,\u201d Curry said. When Booker makes news, Curry added, he watches the numbers spike. Booker has touted \u201cStreet Fight\u201d as an example of how to run a relentlessly positive, unifying campaign and win. But Booker\u2019s 2002 campaign ended in defeat \u2014\u201da really profoundly painful moment,\u201d Booker said on The Axe Files podcast in 2007. Such early losses have been key benchmarks for other politicians who have risen to national prominence, helping them to learn and adapt. Barack Obama\u2019s unsuccessful primary challenge of US Rep. Bobby Rush in 2000 proved to be a formative lesson for the up-and-coming politician, Obama reflected later. \u201cIn retrospect, there was very little chance of me winning that race,\u201d Obama, then a US senator, told The New York Times in 2007. \u201cThat was a good lesson \u2014 that you should never be too impressed with your own ideas if your name recognition in a congressional district is only eight or whatever it was.\u201d But unlike Obama, Booker doesn\u2019t seem to have taken many lessons from his 2002 loss or reworked his approach to campaigning. Instead, he simply waited \u2013 before coming back to win resoundingly in 2006. Weeks before Election Day, James \u2013 who was under scrutiny from federal investigators and would later go to prison for fraud \u2014 withdrew from the race, leaving open a path for Booker to win against a state senator. Ultimately, Booker didn\u2019t have to change; Newark did. \u201cHe is remarkably the same from the beginning to the end of that film, and the time that I\u2019ve spent with him now, I\u2019m also struck by how similar he is 18 years later, 17 years later,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIn fact, he makes some of identically the same jokes that he made in 2002.\u201d Now, a \u201cStreet Fight\u201d sequel might be in the works. Curry is chewing on the idea, and he has already shot some footage of Booker, including on his campaign\u2019s launch day. For his part, Booker says he \u201c(feels) a lot of the same energy\u201d in this race \u201cas when I was running for city council and mayor.\u201d \u201cIn many ways I feel that I\u2019m still that guy \u2014 trying to deal with a very big, challenging, crowded field, with a very larger-than-life character as president of the United States,\u201d Booker said. \u201c\u2026And the strategy is the same. Go directly to people, let them feel the honesty of my spirit and my heart.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Adapted from \u201cThe Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts\u201d by Joan Biskupic. Copyright \u00a9 2019. Available from Basic Books. Chief Justice John Roberts has always had perfect timing. Shortly before he reached high school age, an elite boarding school was founded near his northern Indiana home. Even as a young boy he knew that it offered a place to obtain a superior education and \u201cstay ahead of the crowd,\u201d as he wrote. Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School as his brand of conservatism was in ascendance nationally. He joined the Reagan administration and with likeminded attorneys began trying to roll back liberal-era policies. \u201cThis is an exciting time,\u201d he wrote to a mentor, \u201d \u2026 when so much that has been taken for granted for so long is being seriously reconsidered.\u201d In 2005, when he was just 50, he was nominated to succeed retiring Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. But before confirmation hearings could be held, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died. A confluence of events \u2013 including public outrage over the administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina \u2013 prompted President George W. Bush to switch Roberts\u2019 nomination to the Rehnquist vacancy in search of an easy political win. Roberts became the youngest chief justice in more than 200 years, and from the start he has enjoyed a conservative majority on the nine-member bench. The 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the possibility of a liberal appointment by then-President Barack Obama or a President Hillary Clinton might have deprived Roberts of that majority. But after the Senate stalled on Obama nominee Merrick Garland for nearly a year and Donald Trump became President, Roberts\u2019 hand was, in fact, strengthened. Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch, in 2017, and Brett Kavanaugh, in 2018, have put Roberts in charge of an even stronger five-justice conservative majority. The law in America will come down to what Roberts says it is. The question is what this enigmatic figure who feels the weight of his position will do with his power. Roberts, now 64, could remake the bench more in his conservative image, or he may opt to be more of an institutionalist, especially with Trump in office. He has already called out Trump for the President\u2019s comments attacking judges. RELATED: Supreme Court conservatives question challenges of partisan gerrymandering Roberts also has signaled he may move cautiously. In February, he cast the fifth vote, siding with the four liberals, to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion regulation, at least temporarily. Roberts has long opposed abortion rights, but in this case, the disputed law was similar to a Texas regulation invalidated by the high court in 2016 (over a Roberts dissent), and it appeared a lower court was ignoring that ruling to uphold the Louisiana statute. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Roberts does not appear to be ready to break the pattern of his life\u2019s work. He has staked out unflinchingly conservative positions in most areas of the law over the past 14 years. He wrote the Shelby County v. Holder decision that curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act and made it harder to prevent arguably discriminatory election procedures before they took effect. Roberts also was part of the bare five-justice majority that produced Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, lifting limits on corporate and union money in elections, and District of Columbia v. Heller, which broke ground on the Second Amendment and declared an individual right to bear arms. There is one major exception to his conservatism that has helped define Roberts in the public eye. In a 2012 dispute over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, Roberts saved the Obama-sponsored health care overhaul from being struck down. That decision came only after the chief justice switched two key positions, angering conservatives and baffling liberals. RELATED: Unlike Mueller, health care will likely be a top issue in 2020 It was seen by some as an assertion of independence. His declaration against Trump last November showed another kind of independence. Speaking on behalf of the entire third branch of government, Roberts reinforced his long-standing message that the judiciary is above the politics of other two branches. \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d Roberts said in a statement. It was a rebuke to Trump, who had criticized a judge who had ruled against the Trump administration as an \u201cObama judge.\u201d As a child, Roberts was so serious and focused that an aunt said he was sometimes known \u2013 fondly \u2013 as \u201csober puss.\u201d He racked up A\u2019s and became an academic star, shaped especially by La Lumiere, his all-male Catholic boarding school. Students took Latin all four years, along with calculus and other college-level work. Jacket and tie were required for class. When Roberts applied to La Lumiere in December 1968 at age 13, he wrote to the headmaster in impeccable cursive: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to stay ahead of the crowd, and I feel that the competition at La Lumiere will force me to work as hard as I can. At an ordinary high school it would probably be easy to stay ahead. \u2026. I won\u2019t be content to get a good job by getting a good education, I want to get the best job by getting the best education.\u201d Once enrolled, a classmate recalled, \u201cAt 8 at night John would be studying. \u2026 at 8 in the morning John would be studying.\u201d RELATED: Where John Roberts is unlikely to compromise Roberts graduated first in his class at La Lumiere and went to Harvard, where he majored in history. As he finished his studies in just three years, rather than the usual four, and went on to law school at Harvard, he was sometimes put off by the campus liberalism. But when he graduated in 1979, the country was on the cusp of a new conservatism. Roberts later described hearing a \u201ccall to action\u201d from Republican President Ronald Reagan. \u201cI felt he was speaking directly to me.\u201d In the Reagan and then George H.W. Bush administrations, Roberts developed views that became the scaffolding for his positions on the bench today.  Especially on affirmative action, voting rights and other racial issues, a straight line can be drawn from his legal work in the 1980s and early 1990s to the center chair of the Supreme Court. Roberts was no mere follower of an agenda set by more senior administration officials. He embraced the conservatism of the day, was attuned to the administration\u2019s messaging in the press and sometimes wrote memos complaining to bosses of colleagues on the legal team who were not all in. Yet he was no firebrand in the public eye. Roberts, who carefully prepares for all appearances, has always sounded eminently reasonable, like the star advocate he was when he argued 39 cases before the high court. His confidence is manifest, but never brazen. Roberts became an appeals court judge in 2003, appointed by President George W. Bush, and two years later, was chosen for the Supreme Court. Bush brushed away advisers who suggested he choose an older, more experienced nominee. \u201cBeyond the sparkling resume was a genuine man with a gentle soul,\u201d Bush wrote in his 2010 memoir, \u201cDecision Points,\u201d of his impressions of Roberts. \u201cHe had a quick smile and spoke with a passion about the two young children he and his wife, Jane, had adopted. His command of the law was obvious, as was his character.\u201d One of the top aides whom Bush turned to for advice during the 2005 selection process was his staff secretary, Brett Kavanaugh. Bush said Kavanaugh suggested as a tiebreaker: \u201cwhich man would be the most effective leader on the court \u2013 the most capable of convincing his colleagues through persuasion and strategic thinking.\u201d In late August 2005, as Roberts was preparing for his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans. The storm surge overwhelmed the city\u2019s levees and flooded many neighborhoods. The Bush administration bungled the federal response, delaying help for the region, where more than a thousand people died. In the middle of the Katrina catastrophe, Chief Justice Rehnquist died, on September 3. Bush had no appetite for more controversy, and having seen senators\u2019 initial glowing responses to Roberts, the President immediately moved the Roberts nomination to the Rehnquist seat. RELATED: The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare From the beginning of his tenure, Roberts could count on four fellow conservatives for most of his positions. When Kennedy would shift to the liberal side, notably on social issues, Roberts often took a strong stand in opposition. The most conspicuous came in 2015, when he protested the majority\u2019s decision that declared same-sex marriage a constitutional right. For the first time ever, Roberts decided to read portions of his dissent from the courtroom bench. Justices take this dramatic step when they want to draw particular attention to their condemnation of a majority decision. In what is still Roberts\u2019 only such oral dissent, he complained that the majority was infringing on an issue that should be handled by elected legislators. \u201cJust who do we think we are?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThis is a court, not a legislature. \u2026 We have to say what the law is, not what it should be.\u201d Kennedy, who was the court\u2019s voice on gay rights and its swing vote on abortion and affirmative action, retired last July after 30 years on the bench. Where John Roberts is unlikely to compromise Roberts is now the member of the conservative bloc closest to the center. But he is unlikely to be a \u201cswing vote\u201d like Kennedy, whose flexible approach meant the four liberals could regularly attract his vote, especially on major social dilemmas. RELATED: Chief Justice John Roberts sides with liberals in death penalty case The reconstituted court will be tested in upcoming months on disputes already on its calendar involving religious rights and partisan gerrymandering, as well as petitions related to bias against gay men, lesbians and transgender people and related to abortion rights. Already on the schedule for the new term that will begin in October is a major Second Amendment test involving a New York law that restricts the transportation of firearms outside of the home. Roberts\u2019 new control presents a new dilemma in his effort to make the court seem above politics. The five conservative justices were all appointed by Republican presidents; the four liberals by Democrats. And they do appear, depending on their presidential benefactors, to be \u201cBush judges\u201d and \u201cTrump judges,\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cClinton judges\u201d and \u201cObama judges.\u201d RELATED: Is Clarence Thomas headed out or just getting started? The court\u2019s reputation could depend on Roberts \u2013 and how he casts his vote and steers all nine. Before he went to law school, he thought seriously about earning a Ph.D. in history at Harvard. He has remained a student of history. \u201cYou wonder if you\u2019re going to be John Marshall or you\u2019re going to be Roger Taney,\u201d Roberts said in 2010, referring to the chief justice revered as the forefather of judicial review and to the chief reviled as the author of the Dred Scott decision, which said slaves were not citizens, respectively. \u201cThe answer is, of course, you are certainly not going to be John Marshall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you want to avoid the danger of being Roger Taney.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Adapted from \u201cThe Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts\u201d by Joan Biskupic. Copyright \u00a9 2019. Available from Basic Books. Now that he holds the decisive vote at the center of the US Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts has been moderating positions as he tries to ensure the court does not lunge too far to the right. But there is one area of the law where he is likely to remain uncompromising: race. \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\u201d Roberts has insisted, expressing a view that can be documented back to his service in the Ronald Reagan administration in the early 1980s. His opinion arises from fundamental notions of how individuals succeed in America and reflects his personal experience and understanding of the Constitution. Government remedies tied to race, whether public school integration plans or university affirmative action, Roberts believes, instead hurt African-Americans, Latinos and other racial minorities. When Justice Sonia Sotomayor referred in a 2014 case to racial minorities who may think, \u201cI do not belong here,\u201d Roberts responded: \u201cRacial preferences may themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely that doubt.\u201d Roberts\u2019 views, while generating tension with his colleagues, have made a significant difference in the law, particularly in narrowing protections for voting rights. That pattern is likely to continue as the Supreme Court revisits election rules and redistricting, as well as university affirmative action. A case challenging Harvard\u2019s racial admissions policy could soon be headed its way. The court last week heard a racial gerrymandering dispute from Virginia and, on Tuesday, a related partisan gerrymandering question in cases from Maryland and North Carolina. Additional voting disputes are moving through lower courts toward the justices, including over state voter-identification rules, restrictions on absentee ballots and new limits on voting times. Other crosscurrents have developed on the nine-member bench: While Roberts has occupied the decisive position along the ideological spectrum since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, he is a more consistent conservative than Kennedy ever was. Kennedy, for example, became open to racial affirmative action with time, voting in 2016 to uphold a program at the University of Texas at Austin. Roberts has an institutional interest in ensuring that the court not swing too far to the right and he has already signaled that he might be trying to broker consensus across the ideological divide. But that probably will not happen with the difficult issue of race, where his views are entrenched. RELATED: The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Roberts, now 64 and in his 14th year as chief justice, came of age during the civil rights unrest of the 1960s and \u201970s. He grew up in the onetime vacation community of Long Beach, Indiana, about 60 miles from Chicago. He was 13 when riots erupted there after Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s April 4, 1968, assassination. But he was insulated from urban strife and other racial discord of the day, living in a nearly all-white community and attending an elite boarding school close to his home. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Roberts\u2019 father was an executive at a Bethlehem Steel plant, witnessing racial tensions growing from the federal government\u2019s efforts to end discrimination after passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Department of Justice targeted major steel companies as well as the United Steelworkers of America, alleging that they conspired to keep blacks in low-level jobs in the mills. A series of lawsuits led to court-supervised pacts under which racial minorities advanced to better jobs. Roberts\u2019 life in northern Indiana has shaped his outlook. At the La Lumiere boarding school, amid close-knit, enduring friends, Roberts later said, he learned the value of persistence. \u201cNo quality is more essential to achieving your hopes for the future,\u201d he told the school\u2019s graduates in 2013. \u201cAnd unlike many other keys to success \u2013 intellect, talent, physical ability, health, looks, where you were born, into what sort of family, luck \u2013 persistence is entirely, entirely within your control.\u201d \u201cThe slogan \u2018press on\u2019 has solved and will always solve the problems of the human race,\u201d maintained Roberts, who has demonstrated persistence yet was fortunate to have started with other advantages too. When he graduated in 1973, Roberts was first in his class and La Lumiere\u2019s first Harvard-bound graduate. Debate over affirmative action \u2013 related to student admissions, as well as faculty and staff positions \u2013 was roiling Harvard\u2019s campus in the 1970s when he was there. Roberts was not politically active at the time and later said he was turned off by some of the liberalism of the era. On the national level, the case of Allan Bakke, a 35-year-old white man twice rejected for admission to the University of California at Davis medical school, was moving toward the Supreme Court. That led to the 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, allowing schools to consider race as a factor in admissions but disallowing quotas. Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School in 1979 and after two judicial clerkships, one for Justice William Rehnquist, began working for Reagan. Documents from those days reveal him to be an aggressive lieutenant for the Republican administration\u2019s efforts to narrow the reach of federal voting rights law and racial remedies. \u201cThis is an exciting time to be at the Justice Department, when so much that has been taken for granted for so long is being seriously reconsidered,\u201d he wrote to Judge Henry Friendly, for whom he had worked before serving as a law clerk to Rehnquist. Roberts\u2019 memos show that he was often trying to drive the conversation. He was ready to admonish colleagues whom he believed insufficiently committed to the Reagan agenda. Even in his early months in the Department of Justice, he alerted the attorney general to what he believed were inconsistencies in agency practices related to the administration\u2019s new \u201ccolorblind\u201d racial policies. It was in this period that Roberts solidified his view that remedies tied to an individual\u2019s race could be as repellant as racial discrimination in the first instance. Later, when Roberts was a deputy solicitor general in the George H.W. Bush administration, he developed arguments against school district integration plans and government preference policies for blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. He rejected group-based remedies and believed that individuals who faced bias should be able to sue only for specific instances of discrimination. \u201cRacial balancing,\u201d as he termed practices that gave preference to blacks and Hispanics to offset past discrimination, was unconstitutional, he believed, even when carried out in the name of diversity. Within a year of his appointment as chief justice, Roberts was voicing analogous sentiment. \u201cIt is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,\u201d he wrote in a 2006 voting rights case. The following year, he elaborated on his views of race in a dispute over school integration involving Louisville and Seattle schools. The paired cases arose from attempts by school districts to counteract the return of school segregation caused by whites and blacks living in separate parts of a city. Roberts voted to strike down the plans, voicing a clear, if controversial, idea about what the Supreme Court had intended in Brown v. Board of Education. He said the 1954 landmark ruling, invalidating the separate but equal doctrine, extended to any program separating children on the basis of race, including for integration. Before \u201cBrown, schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cThe school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again \u2013 even for very different reasons.\u201d In that case, and a later one involving affirmative action at the University of Texas at Austin, Roberts questioned the value of diversity in the classroom. Sandra Day O'Connor reflects on life before, during and after the Supreme Court Kennedy, who separated himself from Roberts on this point, believed diversity could be a compelling governmental goal. In the Louisville and Seattle disputes, Kennedy said no proof had been offered that the racial classifications were the only way to achieve that diversity. He voted to invalidate the district programs but without adopting Roberts\u2019 rationale. (The four dissenting justices \u2013 all liberals \u2013 argued that the two school districts had offered sufficient grounds for the integration plans.) \u201cFifty years of experience since Brown v. Board of Education should teach us that the problem before us defies so easy a solution,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cThe enduring hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that too often it does.\u201d Kennedy was among the justices over the years who have challenged Roberts\u2019 approach as impractical in a country still rife with racial divisions. Roberts more fully revealed his thinking on race in the 2013 case of Shelby County v. Holder curtailing the reach of the milestone 1965 Voting Rights Act. The dispute arising from Shelby County, Alabama, has been Roberts\u2019 most consequential decision on race to date, forbidding federal officials from screening potentially discriminatory voting rules from states like Alabama with histories of racial bias. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in August 1965 as civil rights demonstrations and police violence plagued the South. One of the most troubling events that forced passage of the law had occurred on March 7, 1965, at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. In what became known as Bloody Sunday, Alabama state troopers wielding clubs and bullwhips had attacked some 600 activists who were marching slowly and silently through the streets of Selma. The new law addressed discrimination in two main ways: by permitting lawsuits against direct government bias in election practices and by requiring certain states and localities to obtain federal approval before instituting new election procedures. That latter \u201cpreclearance\u201d provision, deriving from a formula that dated to the 1960s, was disputed in the 2013 Shelby County case. Writing for the majority, Roberts said the provision was outdated. \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d he argued, \u201cand while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d His ruling echoed views from his early legal career, when as a Reagan administration lawyer he believed federal voting-rights law excessively interfered with activities that the states should be able to regulate. Roberts concluded that problems the Voting Rights Act was designed to correct no longer existed. \u201cIn 1965, the States could be divided into two groups: those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter registration and turnout, and those without those characteristics,\u201d he wrote in Shelby County. \u201cToday, the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were.\u201d Senior liberal Justice Ginsburg wrote for the dissenters. Her 37-page opinion (13 pages longer than Roberts\u2019 for the majority) was so passionate that it spurred the \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d meme on the internet, a play on the late rapper Notorious B.I.G. \u201cThe sad irony of today\u2019s decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven effective,\u201d Ginsburg wrote. \u201cThe Court appears to believe that the VRA\u2019s success in eliminating the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclearance is no longer needed. \u2026 In truth, the evolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and prevent backsliding.\u201d Joined by the three other liberals, Ginsburg wrote that \u201cThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d The chief justice invoked a different metaphor as he criticized Ginsburg and the other dissenters for pointing to contemporary race discrimination in Alabama. \u201cThe dissent \u2026 turns to the record to argue that, in light of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the country cannot complain about the provisions that subject it to preclearance,\u201d Roberts observed. \u201cBut that is like saying that a driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all redheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out his license has expired. Shelby County\u2019s claim is that the coverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its applications.\u201d The conservative-liberal angst on voting is likely to go on as Voting Rights Act disputes continue nationwide. This month, the justices heard a racial gerrymandering case from Virginia in which challengers said black voters were concentrated into districts, diluting their electoral influence. The justices also are airing two partisan gerrymandering cases, from Maryland and North Carolina. Partisan gerrymanders, which often accompany racial ones, are thornier in the legal realm because while racial bias in redistricting is outright unlawful (racial minorities are specifically protected under the Constitution), the court has never found an unlawful incidence of partisan redistricting. Overall, Roberts has continued to try to narrow the reach of the Voting Rights Act and has remained steadfast that claims of discrimination must be made by individuals in specific circumstances and not by groups of people based on skin color. In cases of blatant individual bias, Roberts has taken a conspicuous stand. For example, the 2016 case of Foster v. Chatman involved prosecutors in Georgia who had deliberately kept blacks off a jury, putting \u201cB\u201d next to the name of each potential juror to be struck. The Supreme Court ruled 7-1 for the defendant who had challenged the bias, and Roberts wrote the majority opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas asked a question for the first time in 3 years -- here's why A similar case of juror discrimination, arising from a Mississippi prosecutor\u2019s elimination of African-Americans from a murder defendant\u2019s juries, was heard recently, Flowers v. Mississippi. No ambiguity has surrounded Roberts\u2019 rejection of the affirmative action programs that a narrow majority has upheld since the 1978 case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. A major test of that landmark, involving Harvard, is now in a lower federal court and likely destined for the high court. A US district judge in Boston is resolving the case brought by conservative advocates, who argued that Harvard unlawfully stereotypes Asian-American applicants and holds them to higher admissions standards as it favors blacks and Latinos under affirmative action practices. Once the judge decides the case, which was subject to a three-week trial last year and a final hearing in February, any appeal would go first to the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court. Roberts\u2019 past opinions suggest he would be sympathetic to the challengers\u2019 case. It was controversy over affirmative action that led to one of the most public recent collisions on race at the court, between Roberts and Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice. In the 2014 controversy, the majority, including Roberts, voted to uphold an amendment to the Michigan state constitution that forbade using race as a factor in higher education admissions. Sotomayor dissented, using much of her opinion to declare racial discrimination still evident in public policy as well as daily life. \u201cRace matters to a young man\u2019s view of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up as he passes, no matter the neighborhood where he grew up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRace matters to a young woman\u2019s sense of self when she states her hometown, and then is pressed, \u2018No, where are you really from?\u2019, regardless of how many generations her family has been in the country.\u201d Sotomayor, who early in her tenure spoke publicly about how she sometimes felt she did not fit in at the court, then declared, \u201cRace matters because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: \u2018I do not belong here.\u2019\u201d Liberals take another look at court-packing as way to control Supreme Court (if they win in 2020) She turned Roberts\u2019 adage about the best way to stop discrimination on the basis of race (\u201cstop discriminating on the basis of race\u201d) against him by declaring that the best way \u201cis to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination.\u201d Roberts took the unusual step of writing a statement, with no other justices joining, to respond to Sotomayor. \u201cPeople can disagree in good faith on this issue,\u201d he said, asserting that it \u201cdoes more harm than good to question the openness and candor of those on either side of the debate.\u201d And as he has since he first began working as a lawyer in Washington, Roberts asserted that racial remedies, too, could \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d That reinforced the line that can be drawn from Roberts\u2019 position as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration to his views in the court\u2019s center chair.",

            "article_content": "For Donald Trump, feuding comes as easily as breathing. His latest shots at the late John McCain and his escalating social media altercation with George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, are the latest examples of how the President just cannot resist a fight. But they also offer a fresh glimpse into a personality that is built on conflict, the search for an enemy and an insatiable quest for personal victories. Sometimes the President initiates a clash. At other times he revives old battles like a warrior consumed by previous victories. Even though McCain died nearly seven months ago, Trump cannot put their acrimony \u2013 which caused the late Arizona senator to plan his funeral as an extended rebuke to the President, to rest. He explained to reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday why he is still taking shots at the Vietnam war hero, including in a recent Twitter rant. \u201cI was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be,\u201d Trump said, citing his foe\u2019s vote against a GOP effort to repeal Obamacare. \u201cI think that\u2019s disgraceful, plus there are other things,\u201d he said. Trump complained DURING weekend that McCain spread the \u201cfake and totally discredited dossier\u201d drawn up by former British Spy Christopher Steele that alleged that he was compromised by Russia. McCain said he provided a copy of the dossier to the FBI. And one of his associates, David Kramer shared a copy with BuzzFeed, according to court records. Kellyanne Conway's husband is trying to tell the public Trump is mentally ill. She doesn't agree For his critics, Trump\u2019s obsessions with McCain and other foes are not just unseemly. They are a sign of a man who is poorly suited to the job of President, and even temperamentally unfit to serve as commander in chief in a dangerous world. But Trump\u2019s refusal to let bygones be bygones is also a political device. He\u2019s used the endless personal battles to stir up his base and give them something to unite against. The feuds offer definition to his life, his business, his 2016 campaign \u2013 where he picked off a golden generation of GOP candidates one by one \u2013 and now his presidency. The President reopened hostilities with George Conway on Tuesday morning, after the well-known lawyer on Monday tweeted a definition of narcissistic personality disorder to suggest that Trump showed many of the symptoms. \u201cA total loser!\u201d Trump wrote, while retweeting a claim by his 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale that Conway was sore because Trump refused to give him an administration job he wanted. Conway was quick to double down in their feud, tweeting at the President: \u201cCongratulations! You just guaranteed that millions of more people are going to learn about narcissistic personality disorder and malignant narcissism! Great job!\u201d Kellyanne Conway said Monday she did not share her husband\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d about Trump\u2019s mental state. Meghan McCain says Trump 'will never be a great man' Trump\u2019s propensity to wage old feuds was evident in his wild tweet storms this weekend. He again went after John McCain \u2013 even though the Republican senator from Arizona has been dead for nearly seven months. The President mocked the Vietnam War hero, inaccurately for coming in \u201clast in his class,\u201d and rebuked him for voting against a GOP bid to repeal Obamacare. Trump can rarely leave \u201cCrooked\u201d Hillary Clinton alone either \u2013 apparently not content with beating her in the 2016 election. He rarely gets through a week without taking a shot at former President Barack Obama \u2013 and often seems largely motivated by undoing his predecessor\u2019s legacy \u2013 perhaps in revenge for being mocked at the White House Correspondent\u2019s Dinner in 2011. And he\u2019s still simmering over past showdowns with other nemeses, such as the NFL: Some of the league\u2019s aficionados have traced Trump\u2019s fury over players taking a knee and team owners\u2019 reactions to his anger at failing to secure a franchise in the league in the 1980s. \u201cThe $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand,\u201d Trump demanded in a tweet at the start of last season. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was never allowed to forget the President\u2019s fury at Sessions\u2019 recusing himself from the Russia investigation \u2013 and Trump\u2019s anger is prone to pop up from time to time even though the former Alabama senator left office last year. The President, for instance, blasted Sessions as \u201canother beauty\u201d in a tweet storm against senior Justice Department officials in February. For a time, Trump was involved in an ugly personal spat with NBA superstar LeBron James \u2013 insinuating in a tweet last year that King James wasn\u2019t very smart \u2013 one of many of the President\u2019s altercations that have seemed to have racial overtones. The President fed another ancient grudge over the weekend \u2013 taking a new shot at NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which has caught his ire repeatedly because of Alec Baldwin\u2019s searing impression of him. And he never lets up on his duel with reporters, who he has called \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Trump has his foreign targets too, and returns to them again and again. He harbors a particular grudge for German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2013 but any US ally that he sees as freeloading off American generosity is especially likely to get a tongue lashing. Trump finds plenty to be outraged about -- aside from New Zealand For Trump\u2019s critics, his refusal to let a fight go \u2013 even ones that he has won \u2013 speaks of a brittle personality that is not just off-putting but is dangerous in a commander in chief. Trump\u2019s tweet storms over the last three days, in which he blasted GM, the \u201cfake news\u201d media, McCain, insufficiently supportive Fox News anchors, Joe Biden and other targets came as much of the world was consumed by a true outrage: the aftermath of attacks on mosques in New Zealand, which killed 50 people. Though Trump condemned the attacks on Friday, he shrugged off questions about a worrying rise in white supremacist groups and did not offer direct empathy to Muslims \u2013 raising new questions about his history of anti-Muslim rhetoric. It was a performance that prompted George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, to suggest that his wife\u2019s boss was suffering from a narcissistic personality disorder. Yet the President\u2019s boiling feuds are just one area in which opinion about him is irrevocably polarized. The Trump base has never had much time for McCain \u2013 even if taking potshots at a dead war hero might appear unseemly. Kellyanne Conway's husband is trying to tell the public Trump is mentally ill. She doesn't agree The \u201clock her up chants\u201d that ring through Trump rallies express his supporters\u2019 views of Clinton. In fact, the endless battles that Trump wages, while rendering him unfit for office in the eyes of critics, are exactly the kind of politically incorrect behavior that made him so popular with his supporters in the first place. Those Americans don\u2019t believe Trump is on a mental precipice or that his frenzied, self-obsessed tweeting makes him unfit for the presidency. A lesson of the last three years in politics is that the outrage of the media and elite opinion in cosmopolitan cities doesn\u2019t just fail to weaken the President, it often strengthens him \u2013 one reason why he picks the fights he does. Not every audience interprets Trump\u2019s flights of outrage the same way. After an expansive attempt to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller, facilitated by conservative media, Trump may insulate himself to some extent from the outcome of the Russia investigation. His weekend assaults on management and the unions linked to the closure of a GM auto plant in Ohio could be seen as gross presidential interference in the affairs of a private company. But the fact that the President is so fixated on the issue on a Sunday afternoon could be interpreted by others as evidence that he cares about honoring a campaign promise to reinvigorate US manufacturing. \u201cIn many cases \u2013 I am not saying in every case \u2013 he is saying a lot of the same things that people are talking about around their neighborhoods, around their dining tables, at their watering holes,\u201d said Marc Lotter, strategic communications director for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, on CNN. \u201cAnd that is why he is connecting with people,\u201d he said. CNN Poll: 7 in 10 say economy in good shape -- and Trump may reap the benefits Trump\u2019s all-fighting-all-the-time presidency certainly works with those Americans who like him best. Though the cycle of constant conflict is one reason why his re-election is far from assured even with the economy cruising and with unemployment as low as it\u2019s been in 50 years. A new CNN/SSRS poll released Monday showed that the President\u2019s approval rating has ticked up to 42%. Conservatives are likely to be far less concerned than Trump\u2019s opponents about his condemnation of the attacks in New Zealand, which he called a \u201chorrible massacre\u201d on \u201csacred places of worship\u201d while not condemning the white supremacist extremism that seems to have been their trigger. It doesn\u2019t look like not reaching out to Muslims after the attack is going to hurt him with the base much either. For much of the weekend, however, it seemed as though Trump had walked into a trap in the Oval Office on Friday when he told reporters that he didn\u2019t think white supremacist movements were a growing problem around the world. His comment unleashed a global torrent of criticism and critical media coverage. But if Trump\u2019s intention was to ensure he did not get too far out ahead of his base he may have been the one springing the trap \u2013 positioning himself yet on one side of a confrontation with the media likely to solidify his base. \u201cThe Fake News Media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand. They will have to work very hard to prove that one. So Ridiculous!\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday. Yet Trump\u2019s strategy \u2013 constantly feeding his base\u2019s more inflammatory political instincts to solidify his position \u2013 comes with risks. A more popular rival than his old sparring partner, Clinton, and a more energetic Democratic base could make his path to re-election even more narrow. If so, governing by feud may turn out to have been a big mistake.",

The policy-fluent Massachusetts Democrat zipped through her thick suite of legislative and regulatory proposals for a CNN town hall audience in Jackson, Mississippi, on Monday, taking questions from voters and, in a declaration that won her a prolonged ovation, saying for the first time that she would support replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote. Warren launched her presidential campaign early but has struggled to break through in the initial round of primary polling. She used the national stage to show off the energetic stage presence and affecting personal story that have become a hallmark of her presence on the stump. For more than an hour, Warren hit on issues ranging from the future of health care in America to her plan to break up tech giants like Amazon and Facebook. She also faced a question about her claims to Native heritage and backlash that followed. Warren has been critical of the Electoral College in the past. On Monday, she took it a step further, calling for its elimination. Asked about how she would expand voting rights, Warren described the process for electing presidents \u2013 that race to 270 electoral votes \u2013 as a de facto form of disenfranchising voters in states dominated by a single political party. Warren backs plan to get rid of the Electoral College \u201cCome a general election, presidential candidates don\u2019t come to places like Mississippi, they also don\u2019t come to places like California or Massachusetts, because we\u2019re not the battleground states,\u201d Warren said. The town hall audience was already cheering its approval as she added, \u201cMy view is that every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College.\u201d The issue has gained added traction with Democrats in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss to President Donald Trump. Clinton won by nearly 3 million votes but was upset by Trump, who narrowly carried a raft of swing states in the Upper Midwest. Republicans have won the White House in three of the of the last five races, but only once \u2013 in 2004 \u2013 did the GOP candidate win the popular vote. The prospect of paying reparations to the descendants of slaves has slowly emerged as a potentially divisive flashpoint in the Democratic primary. Candidates have struggled with how to address the question, which has for so long resided on the fringes of presidential politics. Warren, who has made proposals to close the racial wealth gap a staple of her stump speech, was asked about it early on in the night and said she would back congressional legislation that, according to its mandate, would form a panel \u201cto examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.\u201d \u201cI believe it\u2019s time to start the national, full-blown conversation about reparations,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThat means I support the bill in the House to appoint a congressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, who talk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make a report back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what\u2019s right and begin to heal.\u201d That bill is commonly referred to as H.R. 40, which was first introduced by former Michigan Rep. John Conyers three decades ago. Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee re-introduced it after Conyers left Congress. Asked by Tapper if she would be open to monetary compensation, Warren said she was willing to consider \u201ca lot of ways\u201d reparations could be formulated. \u201cIgnoring the problem,\u201d she said, \u201cis not working.\u201d Warren tells the story often. On Monday, a wider audience heard it for the first time. When she was young, her father suffered a heart attack and the family was thrust into financial peril. Staring down the possibility of losing their home, Warren\u2019s mother \u2013 alone, scared and determined, repeating, \u201cWe will not lose this house\u201d \u2013 entered the workforce on a minimum wage job. Warren details her upbringing and her parents' struggles in poignant moment Warren recalls the moment in an effort to connect her Oklahoma roots with the more familiar image she cuts now, of a Harvard academic who represents liberal Massachusetts in the Senate. The story is also her bridge to connecting with voters facing similar, or worse, hardships in the long wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The stagnant federal minimum wage, she often notes, would not have been enough to keep her family afloat in 2019. \u201cFor a long time I used to think that was just a story about my mother,\u201d Warren said in Jackson. \u201cYears later I came to understand that it\u2019s the story of millions of Americans who \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re scared \u2013 when you got to do something to take care of the people you love, you reach down and you find it and you pull it up.\u201d The backlash to Warren\u2019s past claims to Native American heritage has mostly died down following a series of apologies to tribal leaders. But on Monday, she was asked again why she did what she did \u2013 and faced the suggestion from a voter that it was \u201ctone deaf and indicative of a lack of presidential tact.\u201d Warren in response said that the stories she told were the ones she heard growing up in Oklahoma, what she \u201clearned about my family from my family,\u201d before pivoting to what she said voters wanted to hear about (hint: not this). Still, her past assertions and her decision to use a DNA test \u2013 which set off an uproar among tribes who viewed it as damaging to their sovereignty \u2013 are likely to linger in the background of her candidacy, along with the potential for more embarrassing revelations. Warren has consistently apologized and, in February, went directly to the Cherokee Principal Chief Bill John Baker to say she meant no \u201charm.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a tribal citizen and I respect the difference,\u201d Warren told CNN at the time. \u201cTribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship.\u201d Warren signed on to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill, like so many other 2020 Democratic contenders in the Senate, but on Monday again suggested that she would be open multiple paths to universal coverage \u2013 including less aggressive transitions and plans that might keep the private insurance industry in the game. \u201cWhen we talk about Medicare for All, there are a lot of different pathways,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.\u201d What does that mean? According to Warren, it could be achieved first by lowering the Medicare age to 60, 55, or 50. \u201cThat helps cover people who are most at risk,\u201d she said, but also suggested the possibility \u2013 as some activists have discussed \u2013 of starting with younger Americans. \u201cSome people say do it the other way. Let\u2019s bring it up from \u2013 everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare.\u201d Warren also signaled her willingness to back plans, many of them already baked into legislation from her colleagues in Washington, that would allow people to buy in to public programs if they don\u2019t want to be covered by the private insurance offered by their employers. \u201cFor me what\u2019s key is we get everybody at the table on this,\u201d she said \u2013 an answer that satisfied the audience but is likely to cause some grumbling among progressives.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are preaching about inequality in 2020 from a pulpit of privilege. A key theme of the 2020 primary so far is how to level the economic playing field for all Americans and how to directly address racial inequality. The latest messenger is Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who launched his minivan-propelled campaign in Iowa after a meandering solo road trip he undertook to get out of a post-midterm funk after he fell just short in a long-shot Senate bid. That a father of three young children can embark on a weeks-long unpaid sojourn is evidence of a confidence in both a support network that allows him to \u201csometimes\u201d raise the kids and a level of financial comfort most Americans would envy. Beto O'Rourke apologizes for jokes about wife, says he has benefited from 'white privilege' He\u2019s no billionaire, but he doesn\u2019t have to draw a paycheck. According to financial disclosures, O\u2019Rourke has interests in commercial real estate, a 2012 gift from his mother, that earn him hundreds of thousands of dollars each year and a stake in a technology company he founded in El Paso in the \u201990s. Along with his wife, who has a trust fund, he\u2019s worth between $3.5 and $16 million, according to an in-depth analysis done by the Texas Tribune in October 2018. A request for comment from the O\u2019Rourke campaign was not immediately returned. There\u2019s nothing to say a wealthy person can\u2019t run on a populist message. Trump did it successfully even though he\u2019s a billionaire. But he was selling his wealth as evidence of his success and as a badge for people to envy. None of the rich Democrats talking about an unequal capitalist society are bragging about how much money they have. Quite the contrary. O\u2019Rourke has done well in the the capitalist system, which on Friday he described as currently racist. How to fix it? More capitalism, he said. \u201cI think the only way to meet some of these historic challenges, is to be able to use this engine of capitalism,\u201d he said in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. \u201cIt won\u2019t be government intervention or policy alone that makes it possible. Now having said that, it is clearly an imperfect, unfair, unjust, and racist capitalist economy.\u201d Other contenders have their own ways of addressing the disconnect. John Hickenlooper did not want to be labeled a capitalist during a recent interview on MSNBC because he said he doesn\u2019t believe in labels. But before he was governor of Colorado and mayor of Denver, he was a successful small business owner and started several brewpubs. He did well in the the capitalist economy, but he said he was more interested in making community and revitalizing downtown Denver. \u201cI don\u2019t look at myself with a label,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cAnd I certainly think that small business is part of the solution. I think right now, the way capitalism is working in the United States, it\u2019s not doing what it once did. It\u2019s really not providing security and opportunity for the middle class and for poor people.\u201d In Iowa, O\u2019Rourke borrowed the idea of \u201cbaby bonds\u201d from another Democratic aspirant, Sen. Cory Booker, who has pushed them as a way to undo some of the racial inequality in the country. Each child would be given a nest egg, but children with less from their families would get more for their nest egg as they grow up. Booker likes to point out he\u2019s the only candidate in the field who lives in an inner city, Newark, where he was once mayor. He launched his campaign there, standing in front of a chain link fence and a beat up car instead of a fancy banner. But that doesn\u2019t mean Booker hasn\u2019t done well for himself. He\u2019s made hundreds of thousands of dollars on books and in speaking fees. He\u2019s not rich in a Donald Trump way, but he\u2019s certainly comfortable compared to the average American. .@wolfblitzer \"Will you release 10 years of your tax returns?\"@BernieSanders: \u201cYes.\u201dBlitzer: When do you think we\u2019ll be able to see them?Sanders: \u201cSoon. \u2026 They\u2019re very boring tax returns.\" #SandersTownHall https://t.co/n2hqMm3i6W pic.twitter.com/CjzpHTCTtp Sen. Bernie Sanders has made even more on books than Booker in recent years. According to financial disclosure forms filed by senators, in addition to his Senate salary, Sanders made nearly $900,000 in 2017 from book royalties and an advance against earnings and more than $850,000 in 2016 from book royalties. In the years before his first campaign for President, Sanders was not pulling in that type of income, according to the reports. That hasn\u2019t helped him release ten years of his tax returns as he promised 18 days ago on CNN he would do \u201csoon.\u201d \u201cIt will come out very soon and it will not be any great shock,\u201d Sanders said in March on the Breakfast Club radio show. \u201cI don\u2019t have any investments in Russia. There is not a Sanders tower in Moscow that we\u2019re working on. Nothing in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019ll be mostly a Senate salary and I wrote a book, made some money on the book, you\u2019ll see that there. Believe me, we ain\u2019t Trump.\u201d He\u2019s not Elizabeth Warren either. The consumer advocate and Massachusetts senator who wants to tax the super wealthy is worth between $2.6 million and $8.4 million, according to a disclosure with the Federal Election Commission. She\u2019s set a standard ahead of Sanders and others in releasing her ten years of tax returns. The adjusted gross income of both her and her husband, Harvard professor Bruce Mann, was $913,442 in 2017, squarely in the 1%. We\u2019ll learn a lot more about the field of Democrats as they file disclosure forms and many likely follow Warren\u2019s lead to release their tax returns, even as President Donald Trump does not.",

            "article_content": "On a balcony looking down on Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 rally here last week, two banners hung side by side: one for the University of Iowa Democrats and another for the Young Democratic Socialists of America, the event\u2019s co-hosts. To the students in the crowd, the juxtaposition was unremarkable. On campus, one University Democrat told CNN, the groups have \u201ca pretty good relationship\u201d and, at least when it comes to social issues, \u201cwe definitely overlap with them.\u201d But for the dedicated democratic socialists in the hall \u2013 a handful of whom traveled two hours from Iowa State University in Ames to see Sanders \u2013 the image was a marker of the group\u2019s new influence \u2014 and increasing mainstream credentials. The Democratic Socialists of America has grown more than tenfold since the 2016 election, when its membership hovered around 5,000. Now its signature red rose hung, literally, over the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. David Duhalde, the former DSA deputy director who left at the end of 2017 to join Our Revolution, the group spun out of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, said events like the one in Iowa City offered a unique opportunity to build a more welcoming electoral coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to see Sanders speaking to both the College Democrats and a YDSA chapter,\u201d Duhalde told CNN. \u201cIn order to elect Sanders president we\u2019re going to need, borrowing language from the past, kind of a popular front. Both progressive and socialist groups coming together.\u201d Sanders doesn\u2019t talk about democratic socialism in his stump speech \u2013 at least not by name. But, during his first week on the trail this year, he made it a point to tick off a laundry list of policies that, when he began his 2016 campaign, \u201cestablishment politicians and the mainstream media\u201d had dismissed as \u201cradical and extreme.\u201d \u201cThose ideas that we talked about here in Iowa four years years ago that seemed so radical at that time,\u201d Sanders said in Iowa City, as he had at other stops along the way. \u201cWell, today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the American people. And they are ideas that Democratic candidates from school board to presidential candidates are running on today.\u201d The Democratic Party has moved left in the wake of Sanders\u2019 2016 success, too far for some in its moderate wing\u2019s comfort, creating another juicy juxtaposition: When DSA endorses Sanders, as expected, in the coming weeks, it will throw its grassroots support to a top candidate for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination \u2013 something unthinkable, from both sides, a few years ago. How the group\u2019s activist intensity will be welcomed by Democrats who fear the \u201cS-word\u201d label remains to be seen. Skeptics within the party point to the midterms, when Democrats won their House majority by flipping seats in purple congressional districts, as a reason to pump the brakes. But presidential races play out on different terms, and the 2020 sands are constantly shifting. President Donald Trump and his campaign have already begun efforts to set the narrative, sending out almost daily email and text message warnings about the specter of \u201cfull-blown socialism.\u201d And at the President\u2019s State of the Union address last month, Trump said he was \u201calarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country\u201d and pledged that \u201cthat America will never be a socialist country.\u201d As Trump offered his resolution, Republicans and some Democrats rose to applaud. Naturally, the cameras turned to Sanders, who sat impassively, his index finger drawn across his chin. He was a couple weeks from entering the Democratic primary and surely knew his reaction would be the subject of scrutiny. Duhalde connected the scene in Iowa City to Sanders\u2019 reaction that night on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think Sanders understands that he is representing a historic legacy, that he has been part of a larger movement that shaped him, and that he needs to own who he is,\u201d Duhalde said. Less heartening, he noted, was the smattering of cheers for Trump\u2019s declaration from the Democratic side of the aisle. The ideological divide among Democrats in Washington \u2013 often headlined now by another democratic socialist, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 is less pronounced on the campaign trail. The early announced leaders all come from the party\u2019s growing progressive wing, and their differences can often appear more tactical than ideological. The warnings from centrist hopefuls, like former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, that the party risks losing moderate voters in its pursuit of progressive primary-goers have mostly been ignored. A bid from former Vice President Joe Biden could sharpen the debate, but for now, most of the candidates have limited their pushback to politely informing reporters they are not, in fact, democratic socialists themselves. Among Democratic rally-goers in Iowa last week, questions about \u201csocialism\u201d were greeted on a spectrum of shrug-to-hug. At the Iowa Memorial Union, the embrace was warm, if occasionally muddled. Olivia Stecklein, 19, drove 90 minutes from Dubuque, Iowa, with two friends to see Sanders \u2013 for a fourth time, after attending his events in 2015 and 2016, before she could vote. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can define what I am right now,\u201d Stecklein said, when asked whether she identified as a democratic socialist. \u201cI just definitely support most of Bernie\u2019s issues. From what I know, I wouldn\u2019t care about giving up more of my paycheck if it meant more for others. That\u2019s what I get from \u2018socialism.\u2019 I don\u2019t view it in a negative way.\u201d For some progressives, especially on college campuses, there is no sense of contradiction in staking out positions with both the Democratic Party and democratic socialists. One of the speakers that introduced Sanders in Iowa City, junior undergrad Austin Wu, is a member of both the University Democrats and YDSA. He is also in student government, currently serving as its deputy city liaison. Wu was the point of contact between YDSA and the campaign, which asked him to address the crowd, he told CNN. \u201c(Sanders) has been the catalyst for a new wave of progressive candidates, ideas and policies that seek to reverse this new \u2018gilded age\u2019 that has denied millions of Americans the better life they deserve,\u201d Wu said Friday night, channeling the candidate who would follow him onstage a few minutes later. Like Wu, Iowa State\u2019s Ashton Ayers has roles with both the YDSA and the campus Democrats. He first heard Sanders speak nearly five years ago in a church basement in Des Moines. The experience was a revelation, he told CNN, and set him off \u201clooking into all sorts of different politics and from social media I learned about the Democratic Socialists of America and got involved because that message really spoke to me.\u201d Now, Ayers speaks to other students looking for a political home outside the traditional mainstream. That includes those like him, from \u201cpretty dang conservative\u201d backgrounds in southeastern Iowa. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to use an economic framework, I always say \u2018anti-capitalist,\u2019\u201d Ayers said. \u201cThe DSA is a big tent leftist organization. I think it\u2019s a big tent anti-capitalist organization. The system of capitalism is predatory and it creates an inequality, racial inequality, environmental inequality, social inequality, sexual inequality. So that\u2019s how I always present it, as anti-capitalist.\u201d Polling suggest that could be a potent talking point, especially with younger voters. A 2018 Gallup poll found that only 45% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 have a positive view of capitalism. That number is down from 68% in 2010. Capitalism rules most consistently with older Americans,  with their support actually trending up to 60% in 2018, over the last decade. Positive views of socialism have remained pretty much constant, across age groups, during the same period, during the same period \u2013 its popularity decreasing as the population ages. Sanders\u2019 surprise 2016 surge and the ascendance of Ocasio-Cortez, along with the growing purchase of their ideas within the Democratic Party, have bulldozed a path for groups like DSA to play a more meaningful role on the campaign trail. They have backed down-ballot winners everywhere from the Virginia to Pennsylvania and Chicago \u2013 successes that have made it easier to recruit and attract activists less inclined to engage in party politics. \u201cIn Sanders\u2019 last presidential campaign, he opened the window of opportunity and I don\u2019t think that window can be closed again,\u201d DSA national director Maria Svart told CNN. \u201cBut it\u2019s very important that we use this opportunity to build a movement that will last beyond the election. That\u2019s the way we view this \u2013 as a fight for our future, a fight for the planet. A fight that doesn\u2019t end in November of 2020.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks against socialism, Svart said, confirmed what the expanding ranks of DSA\u2019s dues-paying membership had suggested: the group\u2019s influence is rising and its positions increasingly accepted in the broader political discourse. Opponents are worried. Asked if she was concerned that Trump and the Republicans could successfully scare off voters with visions of Venezuelan turmoil, Svart demurred. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that Trump also called Obama a socialist. Obama was clearly not a socialist,\u201d she said. \u201cSo this idea that somehow, uniquely, this is a smear that can only be used against us and Bernie is definitely not true.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday declined to say whether she would support monetary compensation as a form of reparations for African-Americans whose ancestors were slaves, further highlighting the deeply complicated and sensitive nature of an issue that is increasingly becoming politically salient in the 2020 Democratic primary. In an interview with CNN in Harlem \u2013 a neighborhood of Manhattan rich with African-American history \u2013 Warren was asked three times whether she supports money being given to Americans who can trace their roots to slavery. Reparations for slavery in America is often interpreted as financial compensation for descendants of slaves. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to have the conversation. We need to address the fact that in this country, we built great fortunes and wealth on the backs of slaves and we need to address that head-on \u2013 we need to have that national conversation,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN. \u201cThere are scholars, there are activists who\u2019ve talked about a lot of different ways we might structure reparations.\u201d 2020 Democrats are trying to redefine the idea of reparations Pressed a second time on whether she supports money being given to African-Americans, Warren said she was focused on sparking a national conversation about the issue. \u201cYou know, there are people who don\u2019t want to have this conversation at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what\u2019s right is we to sit down, we need to talk about our history, we need to address it head-on, we need to talk about what the long-term implications of racial discrimination have been, including more recent racial discrimination.\u201d Asked one more time whether she supports financial payment, Warren responded: \u201cI\u2019m saying that there are a lot of scholars and a lot of activists who have put multiple proposals on the table. But we\u2019re never going to get to any of those proposals if we don\u2019t with an acknowledgment of the wrong of slavery and the obligation to address it.\u201d In a growing Democratic field, a number of other presidential candidates have also been asked in recent weeks to state their positions on reparations. The issue is particularly salient given the outsized focus this election cycle on racial inequality and discrimination, and as several Democratic candidates of color are vying to take on President Donald Trump. Support from minority voters, including African-Americans, will be key to winning the Democratic nomination in 2020. Some of Warren\u2019s competitors, including California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, have broadly indicated support for the idea of reparations. But what is less clear is what specific forms of reparations many of the candidates support. Others have steered the conversation towards racial inequality. Asked about the idea of reparations, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said at a CNN town hall last month: \u201cWhat do they mean? I\u2019m not sure that anyone is very clear. What I\u2019ve just said is that I think we need to do everything we can to address the massive level of disparity that exists in this country.\u201d Nia-Malika Henderson contributed to this report.",

Ellis sentenced Manafort to 47 months Thursday for defrauding banks and the government, and failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars in income earned from Ukrainian political consulting. It was a far cry from the 19 to 25 years prosecutors said he deserved. He\u2019ll receive another sentence from a different federal judge next week for the two crimes he pleaded guilty to last year \u2013 witness tampering and conspiracy related to years of illegal Ukrainian lobbying and money laundering. That sentencing could stack on top of the time he received Thursday. Legal experts, lawmakers and others criticized Thursday\u2019s sentence on Twitter and outlined other instances in which suspects received harsher punishments for lesser crimes. Others cited the case as an example of the sentencing differences between white collar crime and street crime, and what they described as racial disparities within the criminal justice system. Scott Hechinger, who works as a public defender in New York, highlighted cases where suspects got harsher sentences. Just a day earlier, he said, his client was offered a sentence of between 36 to 72 months for stealing $100 in quarters from a residential laundry room. He also shared the story of Crystal Mason, who got five years in prison for voting illegally in the 2016 presidential election while on supervised release for a tax fraud conviction. \u201cManafort was sentenced to less than a woman who voted while on probation without knowing she wasn\u2019t allowed to,\u201d he tweeted. Social media users also brought up Juanita Peralta, a mother of six who got 15 years in prison for drug possession, according to the Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform, which launched an effort to get her sentence commuted.  Her 18-year-old is now raising five kids. Hechinger also shared the story of Matthew Charles, who was released after serving 21 years of his 35-year sentence for selling crack cocaine. \u201cGot a job, began volunteering, reconnected with family. The prosecution appealed. He was thrown back in jail. Fortunately, just released again. But should have never gone back,\u201d he said. Charles was convicted in 1996 of selling crack and illegally possessing a gun. At the time of his sentencing to decades in prison, he had previous convictions involving drugs, weapons and assault. He was released in 2016, but an appeals court reversed a judge\u2019s ruling and he was ordered back behind bars to finish serving his 35 years. He was sent back to prison last year, and his case led to national headlines and his release in January this year. Others brought up the case of Kalief Browder, who was 16 when he was arrested in New York and spent three years behind bars without being convicted of a crime. He was later charged with robbery and released in 2013 when the charges against him were dropped. He killed himself two years later. \u201cKalief Browder did almost as much time on Rikers pre-trial for the charge of stealing a knapsack,\u201d Ara Wilson tweeted. Hechinger said he is not trying to make a case for harsher sentences for Manafort and other suspects. \u201cI am simply pointing out the outrageous disparity between his treatment and others, disproportionately poor and people of color,\u201d he tweeted. But in response to his tweets, some said the  main issue is not Manafort\u2019s 47-month sentence but the nation\u2019s justice system that imposes harsher crimes and mandatory minimums for lesser crimes. Jon Cooper, chairman of the Democratic Coalition said Manafort\u2019s sentencing highlights \u201cthe terrible inequalities\u201d of the US justice system. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the sentencing highlighted the disparity between street crime and white-collar crime. \u201cMy view on Manafort sentence: Guidelines there for a reason. His crimes took place over years and he led far from a \u2018blameless life,\u2019\u201d she tweeted. \u201cCrimes committed in an office building should be treated as seriously as crimes committed on a street corner.\u201d The judge has come under fire for saying that while Manafort committed \u201cvery serious crimes,\u201d he had \u201clived an otherwise blameless life\u201d and was admired by many people.

            "article_content": "The issue of reparations \u2013 usually interpreted as making financial amends to African-Americans for centuries of slavery, racism and inequality \u2013 has again entered the political conversation after several Democratic presidential candidates expressed support for the idea. Sen. Kamala Harris of California recently told a radio show host that the idea of reparations should be considered in the face of economic inequality. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has spoken approvingly of the need for reparations, potentially for Native Americans whose land was expropriated by European settlers as well as for African-Americans. And so has former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. The idea, which the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates tried to reintroduce in 2014 with his manifesto \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d has traveled into the mainstream of political discourse once again. But none of the candidates who have expressed openness to the concept has a concrete proposal that would specifically give a new benefit to any group of Americans based on their race. Asked by a young black woman at a CNN town hall Monday night for his position on reparations, Sen. Bernie Sanders did not say he did or did not support them, but rather argued that inequality must be addressed. When pushed by Wolf Blitzer specifically on the idea of reparations, the Vermont independent, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, responded by pointing out that the term \u201creparations\u201d is being used all kinds of ways. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Sanders asked of the word. \u201cWhat do they mean? I\u2019m not sure that anyone is very clear. What I\u2019ve just said is that I think we need to do everything we can to address the massive level of disparity that exists in this country.\u201d Sanders has had no problem in his political career making bold promises that seem at odds with the political reality. Monday night he was boldly promising \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d a $15 minimum wage and free college. Reparations, interestingly, is where he stopped short. Harris, along with New Jersey\u2019s Sen. Cory Booker, is among the group of Democrats of color running for President. First on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d radio show and in a subsequent interview with The Grio, a news website geared toward African-Americans, Harris repeated that the US has to acknowledge that, generally, black people and white people in this country do not start from the same place. But the solution she has pointed to is not one that would benefit only African-Americans. \u201cWe had over 200 years of slavery,\u201d Harris told The Grio. \u201cWe had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalized discrimination, segregation and now we have segregation and discrimination that is not legal but still exists and is a barrier to progress. We have disparities around housing. We have disparities around education. We have disparities around income. And we have to recognize that everybody did not start out on an equal footing in this country. And in particular black people have not.\u201d Harris argued that her proposal to give new tax breaks to low- and middle-income people could help address this problem. The Grio interviewer Natasha Alford pointed out this could by default help black families but \u201cit is not a particular policy for African-Americans.\u201d Harris ended up saying this: \u201cAny policy that will benefit black people will benefit all of society. Let\u2019s be clear about that. Let\u2019s really be clear about that. So I\u2019m not going to sit here and say I\u2019m going to do something that\u2019s only going to benefit black people. No. Because whatever benefits that black family will benefit that community and society as a whole and the country.\u201d Booker has proposed giving, essentially, nest eggs to American children each year so that by the time they are grown they will have tens of thousands of dollars to pay for college or make a down payment on a house. So-called baby bonds are a policy aimed at addressing the lack of generational wealth that makes it harder for African-American children to succeed. But, like Harris\u2019 tax breaks, baby bonds would not benefit only African-American children. Anyone whose family makes under the income threshold of $126,000 would benefit. It just so happens that would also help address racial inequality. Booker has not recently weighed in on the idea of reparations, but his baby bonds have been pushed by William Darity, a Duke researcher who supports the idea of reparations but has argued that baby bonds could be a more realistic way to close the gap of racial inequality in this country. That the Democratic electorate is increasingly reliant on minority voters has been documented chapter and verse by political watchers. Which tells you a lot about why Democrats in 2020 are paying lip service to the idea of reparations. But it\u2019s also not like there is a specific plan to push reparations. The calendar is shifting Democratic influence in 2020 to voters of color Former President Barack Obama was decidedly not a backer of reparations. His long conversation with Coates, published after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, made clear that the first black American president didn\u2019t think reparations specifically were feasible or, at this time in US history, right. Obama: Probably the best way of saying it is that you can make a theoretical, abstract argument in favor of something like reparations. And maybe I\u2019m just not being sufficiently optimistic or imaginative enough\u2014 Coates: You\u2019re supposed to be optimistic! Obama: Well, I thought I was, but I\u2019m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments above and beyond the kinds of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people. So to restate it: I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader\u2019s ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African-Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow. The conversation continued from there and is worth reading in its entirety. In answer, Darity, the Duke professor, argued in his own long Atlantic essay that Obama had not been bold enough in his own policies to close the wealth gap. There\u2019s not a lot of polling on the popularity of reparations, but the writer Perry Bacon Jr., in a post on 538, tried to rank Americans\u2019 openness to racial justice proposals. He put reparations in his \u201cunpopular\u201d category. Which means there\u2019s no reason to think the political realities Obama referenced have changed. The question is whether it is an idea that can be reinterpreted, as Democrats seem to be trying to do.",

            "article_content": "Before Sen. Bernie Sanders sets out on the first campaign swing of his second presidential bid, he has some business to mind to in Washington. On Monday night, Sanders will face questions from voters at a CNN town hall ahead of a dramatic week that will see President Donald Trump meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the public testimony of the President\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the expected unveiling of House Democrats\u2019 new Medicare for all bill. The Sanders campaign is barely a week old, but the forces that will either carry him to greater heights \u2013 starting with an electrified base of small dollar donors and, as of Sunday night, one million online pledges of support \u2013 or keep a lid on his appeal, are already making themselves heard. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign welcomed Sanders to the race with three straight days of attacks wrapped in fundraising asks, warning that the Vermont independent\u2019s ascendance would usher in an era of \u201cfull-blown socialism.\u201d There is a different conversation happening on the Democratic side, which been almost unerringly collegial as the candidates consider the political price \u2013 too hefty at this point \u2013 of being seen to undermine any potential future nominee. Sanders\u2019 entry might have sparked anew old intra-party skirmishes on social media, but the contestants are still playing nice. Donald Trump's plan for 2020 Democrats: Cause chaos and sow division California Sen. Kamala Harris in a fundraising email last week wrote that she is \u201cexcited to welcome my friend and colleague (Sanders) to the growing field of incredible Democrats who have entered this race.\u201d And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, greeted Sanders with a similar message and has since described him and Warren as a \u201cone-two punch.\u201d Sanders laid down a marker in an email to surrogates this weekend, asking them to treat campaign rivals \u201crespectfully\u201d and reminding them that \u201cmany (of the primary candidates) have been friends and allies of mine in the Senate.\u201d \u201cWe will forcefully present our views and defend ourselves against misrepresentations,\u201d Sanders wrote in a letter obtained by CNN and confirmed as authentic by a campaign aide. \u201cBut, let us do our very best to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents - talking about the issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances. I want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.\u201d Beneath the friendly chatter, though, fault lines that will ultimately separate the Democratic candidates are beginning to show. Both Harris and Warren have been adamant in interviews that they will not be tagged as socialists, despite sharing some of Sanders\u2019 most ambitious policy priorities. In her CNN town hall last week, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is resisting the primary field\u2019s push left, made it clear she didn\u2019t believe programs like free four-year college were feasible. \u201cIf I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and we could afford it, I would,\u201d Klobuchar said. She also dismissed \u2013 for now at least \u2013 the prospects of passing Medicare for all, instead pointing to her support for more moderate measures, like creating a \u201cpublic option\u201d for health insurance. The broad strokes of Sanders\u2019 message to voters in these early stages is nearly identical to what he pitched before, during and in the years since his surprising 2016 bid. But his campaign\u2019s early moves suggest that, while his politics are unflinching, there is an understanding that his candidacy must look different in 2020. His itinerary, which will take him to Brooklyn, New York, on Saturday, before Sunday stops in Selma, Alabama, to mark the anniversary of 1965\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march, and Chicago, where he graduated from college and was active in the Civil Rights movement, will play up his biography in a way that the 77-year-old rarely did the first time around. \u201cSanders is the son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland and grew up in a small, rent controlled apartment in Flatbush,\u201d his campaign said in a press release mapping out the trip. \u201cHe is a public school graduate of James Madison High School and attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago.\u201d In an interview, California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Sanders campaign co-chair and the first House member to endorse an out-of-state primary candidate, welcomed the higher expectations and mounting stakes. Sanders taps new campaign manager, gets endorsements from top Vermont lawmakers \u201cIn 2016, Bernie Sanders ran to make a point. In 2020, he\u2019s running to win,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cHe understands that, for the sake of those (progressive) ideas, he\u2019s got to win. It\u2019s no longer just about getting them out there. He already got them out there. Now he\u2019s gotta show that they\u2019re winning ideas.\u201d The leadership team tasked with guiding Sanders to victory will also look different from four years ago. Faiz Shakir, a progressive operative who has worked with top Democrats like former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi when she was the House Minority leader, will be his new campaign manager, replacing Jeff Weaver. \u201cWe are playing to win,\u201d Shakir told CNN last week, another early indication of the evolving mindset of Sanders\u2019 team. Along with Shakir, former Reid aides Ari Rabin-Havt and Josh Orton, who came on earlier, are also expected to play key roles in the campaign. \u201cAll these people working for Bernie, I\u2019m glad,\u201d Reid, who has also spoken positively of Warren, told the Nevada Independent last week. \u201cBernie is one of my friends. He helped me get Obamacare passed. His vote was crucial. So I think the world of him.\u201d The campaign on Friday also introduced a slate of national co-chairs that included Khanna and Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Nina Turner, the president of Our Revolution, is taking leave from her job running the Sanders-inspired group to join the others in advising the campaign, along with longtime Sanders supporter Ben Cohen, the Ben & Jerry\u2019s co-founder and activist. The hiring of Shakir, who most recently served as the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 a job that put him in near constant, pitched conflict with the Trump administration \u2014 was a headline-grabbing first step in the recalibration of a political operation that Weaver, who will stay on as a senior adviser, has conceded was \u201ctoo male and too white\u201d in 2016. \u201cI think (Sanders) acknowledged that that he needed far greater diversity of perspective, both on racial and gender lines in his inner circle,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cAnd in this campaign, he\u2019s surrounded with it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates backed off their statements of support for actor Jussie Smollett on Thursday after he was arrested on the suspicion of falsifying a police report, saying he\u2019s done a disservice to victims of hate crimes. Several prominent Democratic politicians and 2020 presidential candidates had issued strong statements of support after Smollett, an actor on the TV show \u201cEmpire,\u201d went public in January with his claims that he had been attacked by two men. Smollett was arrested Thursday morning. California Sen. Kamala Harris said Thursday that she is disappointed by Smollett\u2019s alleged actions, and said hate crimes are on the rise in the US and false claims make it harder for victims to come forward. \u201cLike most of you, I\u2019ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I\u2019m sad, frustrated, and disappointed,\u201d the Democratic presidential hopeful posted Thursday on Twitter. \u201cWhen anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward.\u201d Smollett told authorities last month the men put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. He received an outpouring of support when he first made the report, including from the California Democrat, who said, \u201cWe must confront this hate.\u201d \u201d.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I\u2019m praying for his quick recovery,\u201d Harris tweeted in January. \u201cThis was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.\u201d In a statement released Thursday after Smollett\u2019s arrest, the senator wrote that \u201chate crimes are on the rise in America,\u201d and said, \u201cPart of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from that truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address. We should not allow that.\u201d \u201cI will always condemn racism and homophobia. We must always confront hate directly, and we must always seek justice,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cThat is what I will keep fighting for.\u201d Presidential hopeful Sen. Kristen Gillibrand said she hopes this incident doesn\u2019t diminish the voices of survivors of hate crimes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. We will all soon know,\u201d the New York Democrat told reporters at an event in Texas on Thursday when asked about the case. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this incident does not diminish the real crisis that people face when they are discriminated against for being gay or for communities of color that are, that are discriminated against for racism.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really important that survivors do feel they can come forward and that this doesn\u2019t diminish their voices,\u201d Gillibrand said. Gillibrand had previously called the attack \u201csickening\u201d and \u201coutrageous,\u201d posting on Twitter last month that \u201cit\u2019s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it. Praying for Jussie and his family.\u201d When asked if she thought she jumped too soon to a conclusion, Gillibrand said, \u201cYou know, it just shows sometimes there\u2019s more to something and we just have to see what happens.\u201d Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is also running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, tweeted Thursday, \u201cIf it is proven that Smollett fabricated a hoax, then he will have done a terrible disservice to actual victims and future victims of hate crimes. It will be much less likely for future victims to be believed.\u201d The Hawaii congresswoman had posted on Twitter at the time Smollett reported the incident, \u201cThis is so heartbreaking. @JussieSmollett, you are not alone - we are with you. We must stand up and condemn this hate, bigotry & violence wherever it rears its ugly head. No one should live in fear because of the color of their skin or who they love.\u201d Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a news conference on Thursday that Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack, taking \u201cadvantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.\u201d Smollett appeared in court on Thursday, where prosecutors claimed the actor had directed the two men to utter a racial slur, make a reference to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and incorporate a noose into the allegedly staged attack. He is facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct, and was released on a $100,000 bond. A statement from Smollett\u2019s camp Thursday evening emphasized that he maintains his innocence. \u201cToday we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders made it official on Tuesday morning: He\u2019s running for president again. \u201cI am asking you to join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country,\u201d Sanders wrote in an email to supporters, codifying a long-expected candidacy that will aim to bottle the same grassroots energy (and money) that he built during a surprisingly strong and successful 2016 race against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! While most polling suggests Sanders begins the contest in a strong second place behind only former vice president Joe Biden (who has yet to announce his bid) there are a number of questions surrounding Sanders and his campaign that he will have to answer between now and the first 2020 votes next February. Here are the five that matter most. Sanders started the 2016 campaign as a side show. He was regarded as a wacky lefty with some radical ideas about the country \u2013 from his push for single-payer health insurance to his ideas about free college tuition. He drew comparisons to the Democratic version of Ron Paul \u2013 nice guy, wild ideas, not to be taken terribly seriously. From that starting point, Sanders had nowhere to go but up \u2013 and up he went, developing into not only a legitimate challenger to Clinton but also a voice for the rising liberal base in the party. In 2020, Sanders won\u2019t benefit from those low expectations. He may not be the frontrunner in the race, but he absolutely \u2013 if polling is to be believed \u2013 starts in the top tier. Sanders has never been a frontrunner sort of guy, so this will all be new to him. He will no longer get credit for leaping over low expectations. In fact, he is much more likely to struggle with high expectations. What happens, for instance, if polling this fall shows Sanders in sixth place in Iowa? Or third place in New Hampshire? How does he and his campaign react to that? One of the secrets to Sanders\u2019 success in 2016 was that no one \u2013 most especially Clinton \u2013 thought he had any chance of going anywhere in the race. Clinton largely ignored him for the better part of 2015, allowing some problematic parts of Sanders\u2019 record for Democrats \u2013 most notably his voting record on guns \u2013 to go unnoticed. (When the race began to tighten, Clinton gently prodded Sanders on guns and health care.) Sanders, too, largely flew under the radar of investigative reporters for major news outlets who were busy looking into Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and others seen as more viable candidates. (That reality clearly benefited Donald Trump in the early days of the campaign, as well.) Sanders will get no pass \u2013 from either the media or his fellow candidates \u2013 this time around. He is among the frontrunners \u2013 and will be treated as such. His wife\u2019s time as president of Burlington College could well come up. And his opponents will do a deep dive into his nearly 30 years of votes as a member of the House and Senate.  This is all very normal stuff in a campaign. But not for Sanders. For his entire political life prior to the 2016 presidential race, Sanders ran (and won) as an independent \u2013 and identified himself as a democratic socialist. He changed his affiliation to \u201cDemocrat\u201d during the 2016 election as, in truth, a political necessity, since running as an independent for president held little chance of him winning. But as soon as his 2016 campaign ended, Sanders switched back to being an independent \u2013 and ran as one for re-election to the Senate in 2018. Yes, I know that Sanders has always caucused with Democrats in the House and Senate. And that his policies quite clearly line up with the policy prescriptions of the Democratic Party. But if that\u2019s all true, then why does Sanders feel the need to be an independent and describe himself as a democratic socialist? And in a field in which there will be lots and lots (and lots) of options for liberal voters, will they really choose someone who has spent almost his entire adult life as something other than a Democrat? There is zero question that Sanders has already had a profound impact on the Democratic Party \u2013 even if he\u2019s not technically been a Democrat all that time. In 2016, Clinton laughed at Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposal. Now it is the default position of the 2020 frontrunners \u2013 with only Biden resistant to endorsing it. But Sanders won\u2019t have the liberal lane to himself in this race like he did in 2016. In fact, the liberal lane is stuffed full of candidates \u2013 all of whom sound a hell of a lot like Sanders on policy. (This is not an accident.) Can Sanders win on a well-yeah-but-I-was-here-first argument? Or does he need something more, something beyond the ideas that energized his 2016 campaign? In interviews setting up this second candidacy, Sanders sounds exactly like he did in 2016: \u201cOur campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Is that enough for voters with a lot more choices this time around? In the 2018 midterm elections, the increasing diversity of the Democratic Party was on full display. From the bevy of women elected to the House to the history making victories for two Muslim women and two Native American women to the candidacies of people like Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, the message was clear: The Democratic Party\u2019s base is getting more female, more liberal, less white and younger. Aside from the \u201cmore liberal\u201d thing, Sanders doesn\u2019t fit any of those categories. At 77, he will be the oldest candidate in the field on either side. (Biden is 76.) Sanders simply doesn\u2019t look like the Democratic Party that scored across-the-board victories in 2018. What he does look like \u2013 demographically speaking \u2013 is the current occupant of the White House. Do Democrats want to nominate an older white man to run against an older white man in 2020?",

            "article_content": "Darrick Hamilton has been in hot demand lately. In the last few months, Hamilton, a progressive economist at Ohio State University, has fielded calls from staffers for potential Democratic presidential contenders including Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand. They want to know more about ideas Hamilton has been developing for years, like a federal jobs guarantee and \u201cbaby bonds\u201d designed to give every kid a nest egg heading into adulthood. \u201cI\u2019ve had this vision for a long time,\u201d said Hamilton, who speaks with a preacher\u2019s zeal about the moral imperative of fighting racial and economic inequality. \u201cIt is amazing that at this moment that we are considering more transformative, bolder policies.\u201d Hamilton isn\u2019t alone. The nascent 2020 campaign is shaping up to be all about radical ideas on the left, with candidates looking toward a populist, progressive agenda that\u2019s distinct from the centrist politics of previous election cycles. This is Trump's economy, two years in Already, Democratic presidential contenders have proposed everything from requiring worker representation on corporate boards to strongly discouraging stock buybacks, along with almost uniformly agreeing with the need to provide some kind of public option for healthcare and invest in a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to fight climate change. Free college, which Sanders floated in 2016, has become a litmus test; and this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed introducing free childcare starting from birth. That means that, all of a sudden, the academics who\u2019ve been quietly working on those ideas for years now are finding an eager audience. Take University of Georgia law professor Mehrsa Baradaran, who has long advocated for allowing the US Postal Service to function as a bank in order to create a public option for financial services \u2014 an idea USPS has indicated it would be open to pursuing. \u201cIt turns out that there are too few people doing this stuff, because there hasn\u2019t been a market for it,\u201d Baradaran said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, you go from nobody reading it, to Warren adopts it, to the Post Office adopts it, to Gillibrand adopts it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very busy right now,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m in DC a lot.\u201d The swing left didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Beginning with the 2008 financial crisis, a new body of research percolated that shows the causes and consequences of economic stratification, upending the notion that simply growing the pie will allow everyone to have a bigger slice. Funding and promoting a lot of that research has been Heather Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality that launched in 2013 as a startup within the Center for American Progress and later struck out on its own with funding from major foundations. \u201cEven in 2008, there was this sense that we were playing from a very old songbook in terms of how the economy works: If you focus on productivity, everything will be fine, and the role of government is to help markets work and get out of the way,\u201d said Boushey. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is that a lot of people are saying that doesn\u2019t seem to be true. \u201c The shift began in earnest with the 2013 publication of French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s book Capital in the 21st Century, which charted the rise in wealth inequality and argued that it is self-perpetuating. Since then, a team led by Harvard economist Raj Chetty has illustrated how a child\u2019s financial future is more closely linked to the zip code where she was born than almost any other factor \u2013 undermining the whole notion that America offers equal opportunity to anyone who works for it. Work by MIT\u2019s David Autor and co-authors illustrated the pernicious effects of trade liberalization with China on American manufacturing, playing into the sense of despair and resulting opioid addiction that has wracked industrial communities. Spiraling housing prices have collided with the rising cost of college, leaving an indebted generation with little hope of buying homes. How to think about the United States' $22 trillion debt And a number of papers have documented how corporate mergers have reduced competition and new business formation, as well as led to lower wages by giving workers fewer job options. All of these increasingly well-understood problems \u2014 which are most pronounced for people of color \u2014 have prompted calls for bigger solutions by Democratic politicians and activists, including not just presidential aspirants but members of Congress like freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The new guard wants to create a federal job for anyone who wants one and give a universal basic income to every US citizen, not just raise the minimum wage to $15 and bulk up the Earned Income Tax Credit. They also want to fund government programs to build low-income housing and renewable energy infrastructure, rather than just expanding market-based incentives; or break up the big tech monopolies, rather than just fine companies for misbehavior. One of the most buzzed-about proposals in recent weeks has been Warren\u2019s plan for a 3% annual tax on assets for people with more than $50 million, which springs from the idea that taxation is a tool of mitigating inequality and redistributing capital. The tax would fund concrete benefits, like her proposed childcare centers. Warren\u2019s team rolled it out with a custom-made analysis from economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez of the University of California-Berkeley, who have both worked with Piketty to compile empirical evidence around inequality and tax evasion. Stephanie Sterling is vice president for advocacy and policy at the Roosevelt Institute, another progressive think tank founded in the last decade within an older non-profit affiliated with the federally-run Roosevelt Library. Its staff and fellows have also been consulting with progressive candidates, building the case that taxes aren\u2019t just for raising revenue. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the way that raising taxes on the wealthy can both de-concentrate their power and can serve to shift incentives towards the creation of productive private investment,\u201d Sterling says. Despite what seems like an explosion of new candidacies and ideas, it\u2019s still very early in the 2020 cycle. Most campaigns don\u2019t have a dedicated policy staff yet and are building their platforms on top of legislation workshopped during candidate\u2019s day jobs. When contacted for this story, most either did not respond to requests for comment or referred CNN to outside experts whom they consulted in shaping legislation, though Gillibrand\u2019s Senate office responded with praise for Hamilton. \u201cSenator Gillibrand had a wide-ranging and meaningful discussion with Darrick Hamilton about many of his bold, progressive ideas aimed at addressing systemic and generational income inequality, which is often predicated on race,\u201d said spokesperson Whitney Mitchell Brennan. \u201cShe really enjoyed the conversation, they agreed about a lot, and she wants to continue to stay in touch.\u201d So far, the candidate with the most advanced policy operation is Warren, who has already stacked up an arsenal of bills that haven\u2019t gone anywhere in the GOP-led Senate but will likely now serve as the core of her 2020 platform, especially as staffers move from her Hill office over to her campaign. That process has already started. A Warren banking committee staffer who for the last five and a half years shepherded many of those proposals, Bharat Ramamurti, just moved over to her campaign. Eventually, these are the types of people who could end up becoming the next chair of the Council of Economic Advisers or National Economic Council, steering policy in the post-Trump era. Once a candidate emerges as a likely nominee, wonks start piling in, hoping to style themselves as advisers and surrogates in order to land a job in the White House down the road. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the job of a good policy adviser in the campaign. You\u2019re not the driver. Dale Jr. is the driver. Your job is to get some tires on there.\u201d Austan Goolsbee For anyone who aspires to play that role, Austan Goolsbee \u2014 an economist who became one of the first advisors to then-Senate candidate Barack Obama \u2014 cautions that campaign jobs aren\u2019t all about crafting the best possible policy white paper, like you can from a post at a university. In politics, it\u2019s about talking points and crisis management. \u201cIf you ever watch a NASCAR race, they pull the car in, and five people jump over the wall and they get them back out on the road in 13 seconds,\u201d Goolsbee says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of the job of a good policy adviser in the campaign. You\u2019re not the driver. Dale Jr. is the driver. Your job is to get some tires on there.\u201d Of course, not everybody is on board with the leftward drift in Democratic politics. Established idea factories in Washington on the center left and the center right have been circling the wagons, to propose ideas that both contrast with the Trump agenda and address mounting concerns about inequality without getting too far out of what they see as the electorate\u2019s comfort zone. Democrats head into 2019 split on everything but Trump Their potential vehicles include comparative moderates like Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, who hew closer to traditional market-centered Democratic policies. Centrist think tank Third Way has put out a 2020 platform including proposals like more apprenticeships, employer-supported private retirement accounts, and a surge of investment in rural broadband. The group\u2019s vice president for policy, Jim Kessler, argues that the Democrats who won in the 2018 midterms did so in suburban districts on bread-and-butter issues like healthcare and basic decency. \u201cI think there\u2019s an exhausted majority out there, looking for something bold but normal,\u201d Kessler says. \u201cIt\u2019s putting guard rails around capitalism, it\u2019s not rejecting capitalism and doing a demolition job.\u201d",

            "article_content": "James A. Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics. When former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz takes the TV stage to promote a possible presidential run at a CNN Town Hall with Poppy Harlow tonight, he\u2019ll be emulating the last independent White House hopeful to capture a significant share of the vote, H. Ross Perot. That is a challenging path, especially this early in the presidential campaign season. Perot, a prominent businessman, sat down with CNN talk show host Larry King on February 20, 1992, as a reluctant candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run,\u201d declared Perot. But after prodding from King, Perot allowed that if his would-be supporters put \u201cskin in the game\u201d by getting his name on the ballot in their states and promising to \u201cstay in the ring after Election Day,\u201d then the Texas billionaire businessman would seriously consider a run. The CNN switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree and Perot\u2019s quixotic presidential campaign got underway. Schultz\u2019s potential 2020 independent bid is being unveiled to voters more than a year before Perot sounded his call on Larry King. Schultz, a past donor to Democratic candidates, says his party has moved too far to the left even though more centrist 2020 options like former Vice President Joe Biden, former Gov. John Hickenlooper and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (who was elected as a Republican and an independent) haven\u2019t declared their intentions yet. While Trump has antagonized and aggravated many in his own party, no serious challengers to his re-nomination have emerged. But New Hampshire\u2019s primary is almost a year off \u2014 a lifetime in politics. Howard Schultz does not do well in CNN's new poll And in 1992, when Perot was boosting his candidacy on television, there were fissures evident in both the Democratic and Republican ranks. Perot\u2019s appearance on the King show came two days after New Hampshire voters jolted incumbent President George H. W. Bush by giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan 38% of the GOP primary vote. They also gave long shot Democratic challenger, former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas, a primary victory over the eventual Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton. The political environment was ripe for a folksy upstart like Perot who railed against the seraglios of Washington: a recession alienated many Americans from Bush, while stories of marital infidelities and avoidance of the Vietnam draft, left just as many suspicious of Clinton. In June of that year, a Gallup Poll placed Perot ahead of both Bush and Clinton with 39% support. Prior to Perot\u2019s bid, third party presidential candidacies were typically born from an electoral schism in one or both of the major parities. In 1980, Illinois Republican congressman John B. Anderson rallied liberal Republicans to his banner but failed to capture any primaries (narrowly missing in both Massachusetts and Vermont) including that of his home state. On April 24, 1980, Anderson announced he\u2019d run as an independent. In June of that year, after Ronald Reagan had wrapped up the GOP nomination, but Democrats were still bitterly divided between President Jimmy Carter and his challenger Edward M. Kennedy, Anderson peaked in popularity drawing support from 24% of those surveyed by Gallup. Ultimately, Anderson veered left naming former Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Patrick Lucey, a Kennedy supporter, as his running mate. He captured 6.6% of that November. In 1968, it was the Democratic Party that was so divided over the Vietnam War and racial issues that incumbent president Lyndon B. Johnson decided to not seek reelection. The great presidential chronicler Teddy White recounted in his book on that tumultuous election, \u201cthere could be no doubt that millions upon millions of Democrats had forsaken the party of their fathers and gone elsewhere. And there was no doubt where they had gone: George C. Wallace.\u201d While Wallace hadn\u2019t sought the Democratic nomination in 1968, he ran in the party\u2019s 1964 Indiana, Wisconsin and Maryland presidential primaries, in the latter scoring 43% of the vote against LBJ stand-in, Sen. Daniel B. Brewster. From that experience, White observed, Wallace retained \u201ca residual know-how of national campaigning, a feline feel for the contours of national politics that was to make him a major force in the presidential campaign of 1968.\u201d Indeed, the segregationist Alabama governor running as the standard-bearer of the American Independent Party hit 21% in a September Gallup Poll. Wallace ultimately carried five Deep South states \u2014 the last independent to win any state \u2014 capturing more than 13% of the vote. Schultz must gain traction among disaffected Democrats and Republicans and persuade them \u2014 along with a lion\u2019s share of independents \u2014 that they have no options in either of the two major parties. Mobilizing that support a year before the primary season produces the kind of voter alienation and angst that has traditionally fueled past independent candidacies is a daunting task. Already, major media organizations will start to test and track Schultz\u2019s appeal. A recent CNN Poll conducted by SSRS found Schultz had some of the worst numbers of any potential candidate tested. Just 19% of voters said they were at least somewhat likely to support him if he were to run in 2020. Of that 19%, only 4% said they were very likely to support him. And even though almost half of all voters (44%) had never even heard of him, his net favorability rating (favorable - unfavorable) among those who could form an opinion of him stood at a quite poor -11 points. If he can\u2019t demonstrate that he\u2019s rallying alienated voters in public opinion polls his candidacy could flag before it\u2019s officially announced. Schultz is a billionaire, and he can afford to self-fund an advertising blitz\u2014on cable TV and the Internet\u2014that could boost his popularity. Sustaining that will not only be expensive but a gamble. History shows us that independent candidacies are forged and feed by the fires of the primaries, not the size of ones wallet.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump can\u2019t merely slur Elizabeth Warren with the nickname \u201cPocahontas\u201d anymore. That\u2019s old hat. To effectively torment and tease her, he now seems to feel compelled to throw in an allusion to shameful episodes from US history. This weekend, it was a not-subtle allusion to the Trail of Tears \u2013 the forced migration of American Indians from Mississippi to present-day Oklahoma \u2013 to poke fun at Warren on the occasion of her official 2020 campaign kickoff. Insensitive by design, Trump set the scene by calling Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d and then drove the point home with an all-caps, \u201cSee you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz\u201d sneer. Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz! Coincidence? Did he just accidentally capitalize those words? Hopefully not, since Trump should know this history. While the Obama administration sought to take Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill, Trump put a portrait of Jackson, whose Indian Removal Act led to the Trail of Tears in the 1830s, in the Oval Office. And in case anyone didn\u2019t get the joke, his son Don Jr. shared it and added \u201cSavage!!! I love my President.\u201d The structure of this new Trail of Tears tweet was nearly identical to one from January in which he invoked Wounded Knee \u2013 site of the massacre of Lakota Indians by the US military in 1890. \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!,\u201d he tweeted then. For her part, Warren suggested during an event in Iowa that Trump may \u201cnot be a free person in 2020.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly the \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d chants Trump supporters used against Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it certainly gets at the point that a lot of Democrats think Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russian government in 2016. Trump\u2019s long campaign to bully Warren began years ago when he started calling her \u201cPocahontas,\u201d but it has intensified in recent weeks with these new tweets that dovetail with new scrutiny of when and how Warren claimed Native American background. CNN political commentator Ana Navarro described these tweets as Trump\u2019s attempt to \u201ctrigger\u201d Republicans. \u201cThere is something about Elizabeth Warren that triggers Republicans, that triggers conservatives, that triggers the right wing.\u201d She said Ted Cruz has a similar effect on Democrats. Warren won\u2019t be Trump\u2019s only target in 2020, however. And so this is where the nation finds itself; the President searching for increasingly inflammatory ways to bully a rival. A day later he didn\u2019t slur Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who also announced a run over the weekend, but he did use her campaign announcement to question the underpinnings of climate change. Again. \u201cWell, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!\u201d Climate change, as has been pointed out repeatedly this winter, does not mean there won\u2019t be snowstorms. Hopefully, Trump knows that at this point. It doesn\u2019t really matter, though, since he\u2019ll take any opportunity to tweet a jab, regardless of the seriousness of the issue. Twitter jokes rarely blend with policy, and it is not just Trump who has seen a Twitter taunt fall flat. Rep. Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat from Minnesota, faces backlash for her retweet of  a comment by the activist/journalist Glenn Greenwald. Greenwald said: \u201cGOP Leader Kevin McCarthy threatens punishment for @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib over their criticisms of Israel. It\u2019s stunning how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation even if it means attacking free speech rights of Americans.\u201d Omar added: \u201cIt\u2019s all about the benjamins, baby\u201d along with some musical note emoji. That\u2019s at once a reference to the Puff Daddy song but more importantly a suggestion that Jewish interests like AIPAC have maintained their power with campaign donations. Fellow Democrats who are Jewish were not amused. \u201cAt a time when anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise, our leaders should not be invoking hurtful stereotypes and caricatures of Jewish people to dismiss those who support Israel,\u201d Rep. Max Rose, D-New York, tweeted. It\u2019s not the first time an Omar tweet has drawn allegations of anti-Semitism. Her arguments against US support for Israel are at this point being overtaken by the tweets. Omar is one of just three Muslims on Capitol Hill and she supports more support for Palestinians and a boycott of Israel. That Omar should be accused of anti-Semitism after criticism by McCarthy is thick with irony since McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, faced his own controversy last October when he said on Twitter that billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer \u2013 two men with Jewish heritage \u2013 were trying to \u201cbuy\u201d the election the day after a pipe bomb was sent to George Soros\u2019 house. Omar and Trump\u2019s tweets are different in that she is making a policy point and he is simply trying to tease Warren and remind people of a controversy following her (the same way he consistently found ways to remind voters about Clinton\u2019s email practices in 2016). But the two sets of tweets are the same in that social media potshots and taunts, regardless of racial insensitivity, feel normal now. Add them to the daily reminders of the racial fissures dividing this country.",

            "article_content": "The news this week has provided a look at what might have been and what could be coming for minority candidates in the US. What might have been is that Democrat Stacey Abrams came tantalizingly close to winning the governor\u2019s race in Georgia this year. That didn\u2019t keep her from getting a national audience for her response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, and she distilled their message into a speech that had pundits singing her praises. What might be coming is that if Virginia\u2019s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam succumbs to the massive and mounting pressure to resign over racist a photograph that surfaced in his medical school yearbook, it could elevate Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax into the governor\u2019s mansion. Fairfax, however, is now fighting an allegation of sexual harassment himself, and he has denied the allegation. Those two things are important together because there isn\u2019t currently an African-American governor in any of the 50 states. And there hasn\u2019t been an African-American governor anywhere in the US in more than four years. Virginia lt. gov: Sexual assault allegation is a 'totally fabricated story out of the blue' There have only been four African-American governors in US history. Two of those, Gov. David Paterson, who served from 2008 to 2010 in New York, and Gov. Pinckney Pinchback, who served for a little over a month as governor of Louisiana in 1872 and 1873, were elevated to office after their predecessors resigned or were driven out. Just two African-Americans have ever been elected governor. The first of those was Gov. Douglas Wilder, elected in Northam\u2019s Virginia in 1990, and the other is Gov. Deval Patrick, who was elected to two terms in Massachusetts. Pinchback was a Republican, but the three African-Americans who served as governor in the last three decades have been Democrats. Abrams\u2019 Democratic response to the State of the Union address could be a reminder for some of how difficult it has been for African-American candidates to be elected to statewide office. But that would be the wrong message, according to Andra Gillespie, a professor of political science at Emory, who pointed out that Abrams outperformed white male Democrats who ran in previous years in Georgia, a state that still tilts toward the GOP. Here's why Republicans don't want an Election Day holiday That Democrats chose Abrams to deliver the response indicates party leaders know they need to appeal to the younger and minority populations that represent a growing portion of US voters. \u201cDemocrats are no longer able to ignore racial and gender diversity in terms of what their leadership looks like,\u201d said Gillespie. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine there not being any kind of diversity on a presidential ticket any more.\u201d Plus, Abrams, who alleges efforts to suppress the vote helped her opponent Gov. Brian Kemp, who was Georgia\u2019s secretary of state during the election, was able to speak to election reform, a key issue Democrats are pushing on Capitol Hill now that they\u2019re in charge. \u201cThe message the party is trying to send is that the elder leadership has heard the concerns of younger people and minorities in particular,\u201d said Gillespie. Plus, she said, it would be awkward for party elders to have chosen a top Democrat who is either declared or considering a 2020 run. Three African-American Democrats were on the Election Day ballots for the 27 governor\u2019s races in 2018. That\u2019s about 11%. It was a blue-wave year in terms of the House of Representatives, but none of three featured African-American Democrats won their races. It\u2019s also true that there are a growing number of minorities on the bench for governorships. In addition to Fairfax in Virginia, there are newly elected Democrats serving as lieutenant governor in Illinois with Juliana Stratton, Wisconsin with Mandela Barnes, Sheila Oliver in New Jersey and Michigan with Garlin Gilchrist. There are also African-American Republicans serving as lieutenant governor with Boyd Rutherford in Maryland and Jenean Hampton in Kentucky. It\u2019s the success and exposure of these candidates and officeholders, Gillespie says, that will have the effect of drawing more into the fold in the future. Both Georgia and Virginia are well above the national average in terms of minority demographics, particularly African-Americans. But white voters in both states still outperform their share of the population. Black voters, unlike other minorities, vote in elections at about their share of the population in Virginia and Georgia. Georgia\u2019s black voting age population was a 30% in 2018, according to Census data. And black voters made up about 30% of the electorate in 2018, according to CNN\u2019s exit polls. Similarly in Virginia, the black voting age population was about 19% in 2018. Their share of the electorate in 2017 was 20%, according to exit polls. Other minority groups, like Latino and Asian Americans do not turn out as often on Election Day, which is one reason white voters in Virginia and Georgia have continued to outperform their share of the population. White voters were 57% of the voting age population in Georgia in 2018, according to Census data, but were 60% of the electorate, according to exit polls. That may not seem like a large difference, but when elections turn on small margins, as Georgia\u2019s did in 2018, small differences can have a huge impact. In 2017 in Virginia, where Democrats won the governor and lieutenant governor races, white voters were 67% of voters in exit polls in 2018 and made up 65% of the voting age population in 2018. What is changing is the growth of other minority groups. Latino voters were a larger portion of the vote in both states in the most recent elections. They grew from 4% to 6% of voters in Virginia between 2013 and 2017, according to exit polls, but that still underperforms their nearly 8% of the population. In Georgia, they grew from 4% in 2014 to 5% of voters in Georgia, according to exit polls, but represent 6% of the voting age population. Asians grew from 1% to 3% of voters in Virginia between the two elections, but that underperforms their 6% of the voting age population. They grew from 1% of voters in 2014 in Georgia to 2% in 2018, but that again underperforms their 4% of the voting age population. The point is that it\u2019s clear the party has seen the logic in tapping its talented minority members, even if they aren\u2019t currently in office, and that voters are not averse to turning out for minority candidates. Which means there will be more minority candidates in the very near future.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has apologized to Cherokee Nation leaders over her attempt to use a DNA test to confirm her past claims to Native American ancestry, the tribe said. The presidential hopeful \u201creached out to us and has apologized to the tribe,\u201d Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said in a statement. \u201cWe are encouraged by this dialogue and understanding that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests,\u201d Hubbard added. \u201cWe are encouraged by her action and hope that the slurs and mockery of tribal citizens and Indian history and heritage will now come to an end.\u201d A Warren spokesman declined to comment on any outreach to Cherokee Nation. Warren\u2019s decision last year to roll out a video touting her family\u2019s Native ancestry and post online an analysis of her genetic data performed by Carlos Bustamante, a Stanford professor, that \u201cidentified 5 genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence,\u201d was met with a swift political backlash. Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. was among Warren\u2019s harshest critics. \u201cUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong,\u201d he said in a statement at the time. \u201cIt makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven.\u201d Elizabeth Warren in Iowa: 'I am not a person of color' By the time Warren hit the campaign trail earlier this month after forming a presidential exploratory committee, the fury seemed to be dying down. Voters upset over the test at her early events, in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, typically framed their concerns in a stark political context, worrying that Warren had given in to President Donald Trump, who has frequently mocked her past claims. Asked about the DNA test during a question and answer session at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, on January 5, Warren explained her reasoning and declared, \u201cI am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes \u2013 and only tribes \u2013 determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\u201d Her point echoed what tribal advocates and leaders had said \u2013 and were continuing to say as their frustration grew \u2013 for months. Rebecca Nagle, a writer, activist and citizen of Cherokee Nation, told CNN in an interview last week that, even though she mostly agreed with Warren\u2019s politics, she would never consider supporting her without a robust admission. \u201cWhat Warren needs to do, at this point, is apologize to the tribes that she has harmed and to Native people broadly \u2013 and then she needs to say without qualification, unequivocally that she is not Cherokee and that she is not Native. And stop parsing Native identity in ways that undermine Native rights,\u201d Nagle said Warren\u2019s explanation, her stories of a familial history and the DNA test, she added, only made things worse. \u201cAll of those things aren\u2019t how indigenous people measure and determine Native identity,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cIt\u2019s how white people try to measure our identity \u2013 by blood quantum or by percentages.\u201d Nagle told CNN on Friday that she was pleased that Warren first approached the tribe privately, but still believed a more public statement was necessary. The Intercept first reported on the outreach and apology. Warren first faced political scrutiny over her purported Native American heritage during her 2012 Senate race. Trump put the controversy back in the headlines during the 2016 presidential election, when he met Warren\u2019s criticisms by calling her \u201cPocahontas.\u201d At the event in Iowa, Warren told a sympathetic audience, \u201cMy decision was to put it all out there\u201d in the face of the political attacks. \u201cI can\u2019t stop Donald Trump from what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop him from hurling racial insults. I don\u2019t have any power to do that,\u201d she added as an audience member yelled out, \u201cYes, you can!\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the 2020 election, white voters will make up less than 67% of all eligible voters, according to projections made by the Pew Research Center and released this week.\u00a0 It marks the first time in American political history that white voters are less than seven in 10 of all eligible voters in a presidential election. That\u2019s a significant moment in the changing face of America \u2013 and has potentially massive consequences for our politics. White voters have long been a bulwark of the GOP coalition in national races while nonwhites have become increasingly Democratic over the years. At the same time, the white vote has been shrinking as a percentage of the overall electorate while the nonwhite vote has been growing. According to the Pew calculations, those demographic changes will only continue in 2020. (Here\u2019s a detailed explainer of how they arrived at their estimates.)\u00a0 This is what the composition of eligible voters will look like in 2020 via Pew: White: 66.7% Hispanic 13.3% Black 12.5% Asian: 4.7% And here\u2019s the racial breakdown of the last two presidential elections: 2016 White: 71% Black: 12% Hispanic: 11% Asian: 4% 2012 White: 72% Black 13% Hispanic: 10% Asian: 3% The big caveat in looking at those three sets of numbers: The 2020 projections are based on eligible voters, not actual voters. And history has shown that simply because you are eligible to vote does not mean you a) register to vote or b) actually vote. The Point: If the 2020 electorate looks anything close to how Pew thinks it will, the demographic challenge before Donald Trump is massive. He would either need to win white voters by a considerably larger margin than he did in 2016 (Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 20 points among whites) or find a way to make inroads into the nonwhite vote, which seems like a massive task given his first two years in office.",

            "article_content": "Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said the intelligence community successfully protected the US election infrastructure in the 2018 elections, but warned the 2020 election will be another target for Russia and other foreign countries that are likely to use new tactics to target US elections. \u201cWe assess that foreign actors will view the 2020 US elections as an opportunity to advance their interests. We expect them to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other\u2019s experiences and efforts in previous elections,\u201d Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Coats and other US intelligence chiefs testified Tuesday at the committee\u2019s annual worldwide threats hearing, where one of the major themes was the threat posed by Russia and other countries to US elections through direct attacks as well as social media influence operations. US intelligence chief contradicts Trump on ISIS defeat In his written testimony, Coats said that \u201cunidentified actors as recently as 2018\u201d targeted US election infrastructure, but the US intelligence community does not have any intelligence indicating that election infrastructure was compromised to prevent votes or change vote counts. Coats also said in the written statement that Russia, would continue with social media efforts \u201cto focus on aggravating social and racial tensions, undermining trust in authorities, and criticizing perceived anti-Russia politicians.\u201d \u201cMoscow may employ additional influence toolkits \u2014 such as spreading disinformation, conducting hack-and-leak operations, or manipulating data \u2014 in a more targeted fashion to influence US policy, actions, and elections,\u201d Coats said. While Coats and the other US intelligence chiefs have said unanimously that Russia interfered in the 2016 US elections, President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed and denied that Russia was behind the election hacking. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, asked FBI Director Chris Wray whether US adversaries will continue to try to weaponize disinformation through social media platforms. Wray responded that Russia did just that during the 2018 election \u2014 and other countries are watching with interest. Roger Stone is expected to plead not guilty in court appearance \u201cNot only have the Russians continued to do it in 2018, but we\u2019ve seen an indication that they\u2019re continuing to adapt their model, and that other countries are taking a very interested eye in that approach,\u201d Wray said. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, has been critical of social media companies for being slow to react in 2016 to the threat posed from Russia on their platforms. Asked what progress has been made, Wray said that the FBI is working more cooperatively with social media companies than it was in 2016, nothing that much of the work countering foreign countries on social media has to come from the private companies themselves. \u201cThere were a number of success stories, only some of which we can ever really share, where the social media companies, based on tips we provided, were able to take action much more effectively, much more quickly to block and prevent some of the information warfare that the Russians were engaged in,\u201d Wray said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re going to need to see more and more of that.\u201d Coats said he was \u201cencouraged with the openness and willingness\u201d the companies have shown to work with the intelligence community, noting that he has personally met with several social media leaders on this issue.",

            "article_content": "Before she was in Congress, Rep. Deb Haaland was initially resistant to make her Native American heritage the hallmark of her campaign for a US House seat in New Mexico. Out of a concern people would think she was solely focused on Native American issues, the freshman Democrat told CNN in an interview earlier this month, \u201cWe thought we\u2019ll just play that part a little cool.\u201d But her voters disagreed. \u201cThey wanted that,\u201d she said, adding that she changed her mind following warm feedback from talking to supporters. \u201cThey seemed proud to be able to send the first Native American woman to Congress.\u201d Flash forward to this year where Haaland made history as one of the two first female Native Americans in Congress. Haaland feels that she and Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas, the other Native American congresswoman, embody a group that\u2019s long been underrepresented, and they bring experience uniquely shaped by \u201cbeing raised in a Native American household, participating in cultural activities, and just understanding what it\u2019s like to live \u2018on the res\u2019 so to speak.\u201d At a time when Native American issues typically only break through the news cycle when attached to controversy \u2013 from derogatory comments President Donald Trump has made about Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Native American elder Nathan Phillips\u2019 clash with Kentucky Catholic high school students last weekend \u2013 Haaland is poised to be Washington\u2019s most visible advocate for Native Americans and redefine how Capitol Hill addresses issues in their communities. By 9:15 in the morning on the day Haaland was sworn into Congress, she already had had her third press interview. No other Congress has ever looked like this At the time, she was sitting at her empty desk, talking to a local journalist through FaceTime. Meanwhile, five news photographers are crammed in her office to capture the scene just hours before she\u2019s sworn in. The moment is simple but striking. Haaland is wearing a traditional Pueblo dress \u2013 a bright palate of colors highlighted by a turquoise blouse and a red woven belt that\u2019s a century old. Hanging from her waist is a string of old silver dollars turned into jewelry, a custom Native Americans started a long time ago because, as Haaland put it, they \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily have use for coins.\u201d After the interview, she puts on a pair of trendy, thick-framed glasses and checks her cellphone. Next to her is one of the few decorations on her bare walls\u2013a sign with four words: \u201cResist. Protect. Love. Repeat.\u201d The image of Haaland standing in her new congressional office is a juxtaposition of old versus new, tradition versus historic firsts, on the reservation versus far from it. Here is a woman who identifies as a 35th-generation New Mexican, yet helped start a new American precedent. \u201cI just felt like I should represent my people,\u201d she says, when asked about the significance of wearing her dress on the day she\u2019s sworn in. \u201cI thought it would just make some folks proud out there.\u201d Haaland, whose late father was Norwegian-American and whose mother is Laguna of Pueblo, grew up living all over the country. Both her parents served in the military, and her father is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was awarded the Silver Star Medal saving other Marines in the Vietnam War. The combination of spending time with her grandparents on the reservation as well as bouncing back and forth between the coasts with her parents helped shape her perspective of the country\u2019s challenges, she says, both from within and outside the Native American community. Haaland worked at a bakery after high school and later went to the University of New Mexico, where she graduated with an English degree while pregnant. A single mom, she started a salsa company and then went on to law school. She would later graduate from a program by Emerge New Mexico that helps train Democratic women to run for office. In 2012, she worked as the Native American Vote Director for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign and then ran as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2014, which she lost. After that election, she became the chair of New Mexico\u2019s Democratic Party, the first Native American woman in the country to lead a state party. In 2016, she also traveled to North Dakota to take part in the protests over plans to build a pipeline underneath a key source of water for the Standing Rock Reservation. Haaland helped build support for the movement and cooked a pot of green chili stew for the chairman of the tribe and his family. \u201cIt was a wonderful place,\u201d she said, recalling the camp where protesters stayed for months. \u201cThey had singing and dancing at nighttime. It was really remarkable that they were protesting in such a strong cultural, peaceful way.\u201d With then-Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham running for governor in 2018, Haaland began campaigning to replace her as the representative for New Mexico\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which covers most of Albuquerque. Former Sen. Fred Harris of Oklahoma taught Haaland during her undergraduate years and helped her get into law school. Harris, whose children are enrolled members of the Comanche Indian tribe, stopped by Haaland\u2019s new office to greet her on swearing-in day. In an interview, Harris pointed to a school of thought that public officials need to have once-a-year training on government relations with Native American tribes, as well as issues that tribes face on reservations. \u201cPeople forget,\u201d Harris said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what Deb helps us do. She\u2019ll help us see what Native Americans mean to this country and what their special needs are in America.\u201d Already, Haaland has become a high-profile voice pushing back against Trump\u2019s racially-charged moniker \u2013 \u201cPocahontas\u201d\u2013  for Warren. Earlier this month, the President again made a mocking reference, this time invoking the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890, when scores of Sioux members were killed by US soldiers. Trump tweeted video of Warren drinking a beer on Instagram Live. If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash! pic.twitter.com/D5KWr8EPan \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!\u201d Haaland called the reference to Wounded Knee \u201chorrible.\u201d \u201cThat was such a dark part of American history,\u201d she added. \u201cOver 300 men, women and children were killed, and it\u2019s nothing to joke about. He just has the worst, worst, worst taste. Doesn\u2019t know our history. It was appalling.\u201d She also publicly criticized Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz for referring to Warren as \u201cSacagawea.\u201d Warren, who\u2019s exploring a bid for president, took a DNA test to try to back up her claim she was part Cherokee and Delaware Indian \u2013 an issue that\u2019s been in the political spotlight since Warren ran for the Senate in 2012. In a January 8 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Haaland said she reached out to Gaetz to educate him on why the term was offensive. \u201cI think the last thing that Mr. Gaetz should be doing is using native women\u2019s names as racial slurs. That doesn\u2019t solve anything,\u201d she said. (Gaetz responded to Haaland on Twitter, saying he\u2019s open to meeting with new colleagues but also pointed to Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib\u2019s vulgar comment about Trump, when she called for his impeachment.) Haaland also plans to focus heavily on the disproportionate amount of violence that indigenous women face. Education and environmental issues are other high priorities that Haaland wants to tackle while in Congress. On the morning of her swearing-in, Haaland opened up her office to greet friends, family and visitors from New Mexico. The space soon morphed into a lively mosaic of bolo ties, cowboy hats, and tribal patterns. The room quieted as her 83-year-old mother, Mary Toya, was wheeled in. Haaland pushed her into her office and started pointing to the few pieces of d\u00e9cor she had on her shelves \u2013 framed black-and-white photos of her parents and grandparents and a kachina doll from her mother. Toya reached for her daughter\u2019s hand as she surveyed the wall and tears welled in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d she said. This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "Rep. Steve King, the Iowa Republican who has a history of making racially inflammatory remarks, said Friday he was not concerned he would face any backlash from his party after making sympathetic comments towards white supremacists. Asked if he was worried that GOP leaders would strip him from committee assignments, King told CNN, \u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing like that \u2013 why would anybody do that?\u201d He also said he has no concerns that the National Republican Congressional Committee won\u2019t endorse him in his primary, saying, \u201cThey never have \u2013 that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d And the Iowa Republican said he\u2019s not worried that his comments \u2013 when he told The New York Times, \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d \u2013 will affect his chances at re-election. He said he has not heard push back from local Republican leaders in Iowa. \u201cNo one has contacted me with concerns, these folks know me,\u201d he told reporters. King may not be too far off-base. While a senior GOP aide said that King\u2019s remarks amounted to a \u201ctipping point,\u201d it was hardly clear what next steps GOP leadership would take. On Friday, a top House Democratic leader endorsed an idea about formally censuring King, but it was far from clear whether any Republicans would get behind it as well. The three top Republicans \u2013 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney \u2013 all sharply rebuked King over his comments in separate written statements on Thursday. How in the world is Steve King still in Congress? On Friday, Scalise would not say if King should be punished. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we all reject that kind of hateful ideology,\u201d Scalise told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s evil and we ought to reject everything it represents.\u201d Asked if he would support King in his 2020 primary bid, Scalise said, \u201cI haven\u2019t even been focusing on the politics of what\u2019s going to happen later next year. I mean obviously we\u2019re going to have a lot of time for politics.\u201d The comments come at an awkward time for the GOP, which has struggled to attract minorities under President Donald Trump, who has often stoked racial tensions to advance his arguments during his two years in office. Sen. Tim Scott, the lone black GOP senator, wrote in an opinion piece Friday that the GOP should not be silent over King. \u201cSome in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism \u2014 it is because of our silence when things like this are said,\u201d Scott wrote in The Washington Post. For the most part, however, Republicans have been quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, when asked if King should be punished. \u201cI think leadership has pushed back, and I know he\u2019s put out a clarifying statement.\u201d Asked if he would favor punishing King, Cole said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into a public discussion on that.\u201d Indeed, while some Republicans repudiated his remarks, saying they sharply condemn white supremacists, influential GOP lawmakers were uncertain what to do about King. The most senior Republican in the Senate, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said this about King\u2019s remarks Friday: \u201cI think that any claim of white supremacy is wrong and I detest it.\u201d But Grassley was non-committal about whether he\u2019d back his fellow Iowa Republican again for re-election. \u201cVery seldom do I get involved in primaries and right now you\u2019re two years away from elections,\u201d Grassley told CNN. \u201cAsk me maybe in a year and a half or something.\u201d Asked if King was fit to serve in office, Grassley said, \u201cThe people of Iowa elected him and so, you know, the people have made a choice.\u201d On the House side, GOP leaders continued to struggle with how to address their controversial member. Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Friday he disagrees \u201cvehemently with the comments\u201d and they were \u201cnot helpful to what we\u2019re trying to do\u201d when asked if King should be punished by the GOP. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually get involved in primaries,\u201d Emmer told CNN when asked if the party committee would endorse him. Asked if that meant the NRCC also would not support him in a general election should he win the nomination for a 10th term in 2020, Emmer said, \u201cI think it\u2019s way too early. \u2026 You\u2019re talking two years from now. I mean we don\u2019t typically get involved in primaries and that\u2019s about all I have to say.\u201d Recognizing the growing controversy, King took to the floor Friday to try to clean it up. King said he approached Scalise to let him know he planned to discuss the matter on the floor. \u201cI said this is what I\u2019m prepared to do, and we agreed that was a good thing to do.\u201d But he made clear no one in the GOP told him to make those remarks. On the floor, King contended his comments were taken out of context, saying he rejects white supremacist ideology and labels on individuals. \u201cI regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon this Congress and this country and especially in my state and in my congressional district,\u201d King said on the floor. \u201cBut the people who do know me know I wouldn\u2019t even have to make this statement because they know my life they know my history, they know that I have lived in the same place since 1978.\u201d \u201cI reject that history; I reject that ideology,\u201d King said. \u201cI defend American civilization, which is an essential component of western civilization.\u201d As he left the floor, King was asked by reporters if he was worried about losing a ranking member position on a House Judiciary subcommittee. \u201cI\u2019ve had no discussion about that. I haven\u2019t given it any thought,\u201d King said. \u201cBut the more you guys write about that stuff, then it becomes an issue.\u201d While Republicans remained mostly silent, some Democrats weighed their next steps. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio is considering offering a formal resolution censuring King for the latest in a history of racially tinged remarks. The most senior black leader in Congress, House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, told CNN he supports that move. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him about that,\u201d Clyburn said when asked if he views King as a racist. \u201cI do think he has racial tendencies.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Friday she had yet to see King\u2019s remarks when asked if she would back a censure resolution. \u201cI have not seen what he said, but he makes terrible comments all the time, so this is not anything new.\u201d But the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Karen Bass, said Friday that Democrats should let Republicans punish King and avoid taking up the matter because, she said, it would easily be dismissed as a partisan issue. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if censure is the right thing to do, but something absolutely should be done because he has been consistent in his disrespect, disregard for his colleagues,\u201d Bass said. \u201cHis party needs to absolutely do something definitive. I\u2019m not so sure it should be the House, because if it\u2019s the House, then they\u2019ll blame it on the Democrats.\u201d Bass added, \u201cHe\u2019s got a long history of this.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.

            "article_content": "Denouncing big money in politics is fast becoming a rallying cry for Democrats hoping to win over the party\u2019s progressive voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election. But some of the party\u2019s fundraisers and strategists say those candidates may have little power to rein in the party\u2019s big elite fundraisers and donors, who are eager to raise and spend whatever it takes to topple President Donald Trump. Swearing off super PACs headed into 2020 is \u201clike bringing a butter knife to a gun fight,\u201d said Dallas lawyer Marc Stanley, who raised money for President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Stanley also helped create a super PAC that attacked Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz on the airwaves during the 2018 Senate campaign, despite Democratic nominee Beto O\u2019Rourke disavowing such groups. \u201cI would prefer that we had public funding of campaigns or just small donors funding campaigns,\u201d Stanley told CNN this week. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not reality. We need to be prepared to fight. The consequences of this election are just too great.\u201d A number of likely candidates are renouncing super PACs and direct donations from corporate political actions committees. For example, former House and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who is scheduled to announce his 2020 plans on Saturday, recently pledged to refuse PAC contributions and has challenged other Democrats to do the same. O\u2019 Rourke, who is mulling his own bid, rejected all PAC money in his unsuccessful Senate campaign and still raised a staggering $80 million, powered, in part, by his online supporters. This week, aides to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently kicked off a presidential exploratory committee, upped the demand that Democrats reject super PACs and self-funding candidates, blasting out a campaign email that urged rivals \u201cto show some moral backbone.\u201d But some Democratic super PACs already have begun to amass large sums to prepare for a protracted battle for the party\u2019s nomination and to confront a President who raised an unprecedented $106 million for his re-election before even hitting the two-year mark of his first term. Steve Phillips, a prominent San Francisco donor, said he has secured $4 million in pledges for Dream United, a super PAC he recently established to support a potential presidential bid by New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker. He said he\u2019s hopeful he can raise $10 million by the end of March, the first fundraising quarter of the election cycle. Super PACs are a powerful weapon in politics because they allow political operatives to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from virtually any source as long as they do not coordinate their spending decisions with candidates. Phillips himself staged an independent effort that spent $11 million to back Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign in 2008, even though Obama never endorsed the move. He said his new group will provide a vehicle for well-off donors, particularly those from racial and ethnic minority groups, to show their support for Booker, the first African-American elected to the US Senate from New Jersey. Billionaire Tom Steyer will not run for president in 2020 \u201cCory, like Obama, inspires people across the full economic spectrum,\u201d Phillips said. He said Booker built relationships with low-income New Jersey residents during his tenure as Newark mayor but also has \u201centhusiastic supporters in the 1%.\u201d Booker has not endorsed Phillips\u2019 effort. Booker spokesman Jeff Giertz told CNN that the senator still is weighing whether to seek the presidency. \u201cThere has been no activity on his part or that of his team to organize or endorse the creation of a super PAC,\u201d Giertz said in an email. But Phillips said his work will continue, likely focused on promoting Booker\u2019s candidacy in the states that follow Iowa and New Hampshire in the nomination process, including South Carolina, Nevada and possibly California, which recently moved up its primary to March. Another super PAC, Priorities USA Action, and its nonprofit arm already are working to build an operation to target Trump and defend Democrats\u2019 eventual nominee. Priorities, created to help Obama win a second term in 2012 and deployed again to aid Hillary Clinton in 2016, has secured pledges totaling $74 million, said its executive director Patrick McHugh. That\u2019s nearly twice what it had raised at the same point in the last presidential cycle, he said. \u201cWe agree that Citizens United should be overturned to get big money out of politics,\u201d McHugh said, referring to Supreme Court ruling that helped pave the way for unlimited corporate spending in candidate races. \u201cBut we already are facing an onslaught of money from the other side, and we\u2019ve got be prepared for the general election when it comes.\u201d Warren, a Harvard professor turned consumer advocate, already has a vast base of small-dollar donors. More than $6 out of every $10 she collected from individuals for her 2018 Senate re-election came in amounts of $200 or less \u2013 one of the highest proportions of small-donor support among members of Congress considering White House campaigns, federal campaign-finance records show. Within days of announcing her exploratory committee, Warren fired warning shots at moneyed interests, criticizing both super PACs and the wealthy businessmen who are considering funding their own campaigns for the Democratic nomination. \u201cNo to the billionaires,\u201d Warren said earlier this month on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show,\u201d asking Democrats to \u201clink arms\u201d in support of grass-roots funding. This week, one billionaire \u2013 former hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer \u2013 took himself out of the running for president. But others, most notably former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, are considering bids. Bloomberg, speaking Friday in Texas, said using his own money to fund his three successful campaigns for New York mayor guaranteed he was not beholden to contributors. He said he would self-fund a White House bid if he runs. \u201cI think not having to adjust what you say and what you worked on, based on who financed your campaign, is one of the things that the public really likes,\u201d Bloomberg said. Another independently wealthy businessman, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, has been running for president for nearly two years, primarily off money he has personally given to his long-shot campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a negative at all to invest your money in yourself and campaign,\u201d said Delaney, who also raised money for Clinton in 2016. \u201cI have more respect for the American people than that and I think they, when you are running for President, the candidates who are good, whether they are self-funders or not, will rise to the top.\u201d Elizabeth Warren sends warning to wealthy potential competitors with call for no self-funding In an interview with CNN, Delaney acknowledged that the rise of digital fundraising makes large-dollar donations less important. \u201cIt has to be that. The question is to what degree,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact there is a whole new way for people to raise money, by definition, means that traditional fundraising is a smaller part of the pie. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important.\u201d Steve Elmendorf, a veteran Washington lobbyist who raised money for Clinton and served as a senior aide in Democrat John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign, said pragmatism, rather than lofty principles, likely will govern how much candidates rely on super PACs and the fundraisers who \u201cbundle\u201d together campaign donations. \u201cIf you are a senator or a governor who has no proven record of raising online money, you\u2019re going to need some bundlers to get you going on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\u201d \u201cNot to be cynical, but I think people adjust to the situation at hand,\u201d Elmendorf told CNN. \u201cElizabeth Warren doesn\u2019t need a super PAC. She\u2019s a proven online fundraiser. Some other people may.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren was in Iowa this weekend \u2013 SHE\u2019S RUNNING!! \u2013 and played to generally positive reviews. But there was one moment that stood out to me as awkward and confusing. And yes, it had to do with her October announcement regarding her Native American heritage. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Here\u2019s the exchange between Warren and a questioner (shout-out to MJ Lee and Amanda Golden for this \u2013 and bolding below is mine): QUESTIONER: \u201cWhy did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully?\u201d WARREN: \u201cYeah, well, you know, glad you asked that question, I genuinely am, and am glad we have a chance to talk about it. I am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference. I grew up out in Oklahoma, and like a lot of folks out in Oklahoma, we heard the family stories of our ancestry. When I first ran for public office, the first time was in 2012, and the Republicans honed in on this part of my history and thought they could make a lot of hay out of it, a lot of racial slurs and a lot of ugly stuff that went on. And so my decision was I\u2019m just going to put it all out there. Took a while, but just put it all out there. All of my hiring records, including a DNA test, it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s online, anybody can look at it. It\u2019s there.\u201d A lot of people \u2013 myself very much included \u2013 had been wondering exactly why Warren did what she did when she did. An announcement that you probably, maybe, have some Native American blood in order to rebut the attacks from President Donald Trump that you sought to gain advancement by citing that heritage? (Note: There is no actual evidence Warren got ahead in academia by describing herself as Native American.) And to do it right in the heart of the 2018 campaign, as Democrats were trying to win back control of the House and Senate? The \u201cwhy\u201d appears to be what most people suspected: Warren released the DNA test \u2013 and a subsequent five-minute video explaining it \u2013 to clear the decks before she ran for president. (Warren likely believed \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to say she was wrong \u2013 that her announcement would have zero effect on the Democratic fight for congressional majorities.) Warren wanted to deal with the whole Native American thing \u2013 and Trump\u2019s repeated name-calling (he refers to her as \u201cPocahontas\u201d in tweets) \u2013 prior to announcing for president, which she did on New Year\u2019s Eve. Obviously, that didn\u2019t work. Instead of putting aside any doubts as to whether Warren\u2019s past fumbling on the heritage question might be a fatal flaw that Trump could and would exploit, all Warren\u2019s video did was shine a bright light on the problem. What Warren\u2019s announcement did was, effectively, say this to Democratic voters: REMEMBER WHEN I HAD THAT ISSUE IN 2012 WITH WHETHER I WAS A NATIVE AMERICAN????? While Trump would never \u2013 and will never \u2013 stop attacking Warren based on what some DNA test said, the fact that the test was so hugely inconclusive should have been a warning sign to her that it was never going to have the we-can-all-put-this-debate-behind-us impact for which she was clearly hoping. When the entire video and reveal hang on this sentence from a Stanford geneticist  \u2013 \u201cthe facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree\u201d \u2013 you know that you aren\u2019t going to get the outcome you were going for. This isn\u2019t about Trump. Not really. As Warren said in her same answer in Iowa over the weekend: \u201cNow, I can\u2019t stop Donald Trump from doing what he\u2019s going to do. I can\u2019t stop him from hurling racial insults. I don\u2019t have any power to do that.\u201d True! What this was \u2013 and is \u2013 all about was Warren trying to solve a problem within the Democratic activist and donor base. There\u2019s a 0% chance she makes the move she did on her DNA test unless she has some indications that people within her party are worried about what Trump might do to her with it in the general election if she winds up as the Democratic nominee. Now, at least, we have the explanation of why she did what she did from her own mouth. The decision was weird then. And even with Warren\u2019s explanation, it\u2019s just as weird now.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren was confronted by a voter in Sioux City on Saturday morning over her controversial decision to use a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry. \u201cI am not a person of color,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said. \u201cI am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes \u2013 and only tribes \u2013 determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\u201d Warren has addressed the backlash to her DNA test before, using similar language, but this \u2013 the first question on her first full day of campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in Iowa \u2013 underscored the lingering concerns over her decision. The logic behind it, Warren explained, was simple. She grew up in Oklahoma, and like so many others in that region of the country, had been told of her family\u2019s Native American roots. The controversy traces back years, and more than one election, she said, recalling that her claim had been used against her by Republicans during her successful 2012 Senate campaign. \u201cMy decision was to put it all out there,\u201d Warren said of the final calculation this time around. The questioner, though, seemed less concerned about the offense the test caused to some Native Americans than its potential to fuel President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cI can\u2019t stop Donald Trump from what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop him from hurling racial insults. I don\u2019t have any power to do that,\u201d she added as an audience member yelled out, \u201cYes, you can!\u201d At that, Warren pivoted back to her campaign message, saying: \u201cWhat I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families. What I think 2020 is going to be about is not my family, it\u2019s about the tens of millions of families across this country who just want a level playing field.\u201d Warren: I'm in this fight because I'm grateful Warren emerged as a leading critic of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, and he has responded \u2013 repeatedly and throughout his presidency \u2013 by mocking her Native American heritage and referring to her as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d But her choice to effectively engage the criticism from the President and others in October with a DNA test irked many Democrats and overshadowed her midterm message. (Warren would still win election to a second term in the Senate by nearly 25 percentage points.) In an interview with Fox News after she announced her presidential exploratory committee earlier this week, Trump skewered Warren over the test and said he would \u201clove to run against her.\u201d Asked if he thought Warren believed she could defeat him in 2020, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.\u201d Before Warren spoke Saturday in Iowa, Judy Plank, a Democrat who had driven down from Le Mars, about a half-hour north, said she was concerned Warren had, in publicizing the results, set herself up for further ridicule from the President. \u201cIt\u2019s just playing into his hands,\u201d Plank said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting onto his turf, and he knows how to handle his turf. And so I\u2019m not sure she should have gotten into it, but anyway I hope she learned from it.\u201d",

When asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d if he had been unaware of the allegations, Sanders replied, \u201cYes, I was little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.\u201d \u201cI am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I\u2019m hearing from now, that women felt they were disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible,\u201d Sanders initially said to Cooper. The former Democratic candidate stressed that his 2018 Senate re-election campaign had established new protocols for handling sexual harassment allegations. \u201cWe put forward the strongest set of principles in terms of mandatory training, in terms of women, if they felt harassed, having an independent firm that they can go to,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I think that that\u2019s kind of the gold standard of what we should be doing.\u201d \u201cOf course, if I run, we will do better next time,\u201d he added of a potential 2020 campaign.

Neera Tanden is the President and CEO of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN. Too often in the United States, our lawmakers prize their own reelection more than actually doing the work that matters for their constituents or their policy preferences. This problem is exacerbated by politicians who use partisan gerrymandering to hand-pick their voters instead of allowing the people to choose their representatives. Once their reelection is assured, these politicians frequently ignore the voters\u2019 concerns about some of the most pressing issues of our time \u2013 including curbing the epidemic of gun violence. In its most pernicious form, partisan gerrymandering can allow a particular party to earn a minority of the statewide vote but still hold a majority of seats in the state legislatures \u2013 or in the US House of Representatives. Put another way, a majority of the people can be governed by the minority party. This corruption of the democratic process has occurred with alarming frequency in recent years. The Center for American Progress (CAP) has conducted a study that examines the most recent elections for every seat in the state legislatures of North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In each state, residents cast more total votes for Democrats than they did for Republicans. Yet, in all four of these places, Republicans currently control both houses of the state legislature. Partisan gerrymandering allows these politicians \u2013 who know they will retain majorities before the elections even happen \u2013 to stop listening to the citizens of their state while they pander to the extremes of their base and the special interests who fund their reelection. Just ask advocates trying to address the critical issue of preventing gun violence. Across the country, a strong majority of voters support commonsense policies that can help prevent gun violence. These measures include requiring universal background checks for all gun sales to ensure that individuals prohibited by law from possessing guns aren\u2019t able to easily able to evade that restriction through a private sale. Congress agrees to millions in gun violence research for the first time in decades Another gun safety measure that has broad public support are extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs), a civil legal process that enables family members or law enforcement officials to petition a judge for the temporary removal of firearms from a person who presents an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others. Despite support among Democratic state legislators and the public for universal background checks and ERPO laws in these four states \u2013 and despite voters casting more votes for Democratic legislators who would be likely to pass them \u2013 legislation on these measures has stalled. North Carolina paints an especially damning profile of this failure in our democracy. The state\u2019s population suffers gun murders at a 16% higher rate than the national average, and has earned a \u201cD\u201d rating on the Giffords Law Center\u2019s annual Gun Law Scorecard for the strength of its gun laws. It should come as little surprise then that addressing the state\u2019s fatally broken gun laws was a top priority of Democratic leaders in the state this legislative session. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, along with Democratic leaders in North Carolina\u2019s legislature, have called for the adoption of ERPO legislation, as well as another gun violence prevention bill that would, among other things, require permits for assault weapons purchases, impose a 72-hour waiting period, limit the size of ammunition magazines and mandate safe storage of guns. But the Republican-controlled legislature refuses to consider these proposals. SE Cupp: Our gun laws make it too damn easy for haters to kill How can the Republicans block progress on this issue? In North Carolina\u2019s 2018 election, Democrats won a majority of all the votes cast for major-party candidates \u2013 50.5% of the votes for state Senate, and 51.2% of votes for state House. And yet, Republicans won the majority in both chambers \u2013 58% of the seats in the Senate and 54.2% of the seats in the House. Because of gerrymandering, the wishes of the people are ignored and North Carolina\u2019s legislature continually fails to act to prevent gun violence. This situation is simply unacceptable. The composition of our state legislatures should more accurately reflect the results of our democratic elections \u2013 and their policy agendas should follow the beliefs of the people they represent. But in order for that to truly happen in the United States, we need to end the scourge of partisan and racial gerrymandering. To fully address the threat of gerrymandering, both Congress and the state legislatures need to act. In every state \u2013 and at every level of government \u2013 districts should be drawn by nonpartisan, independent commissions, and they should be required to fairly represent the population of the state. Fortunately, a number of states, like Michigan, have taken the critical step of putting the power to draw districts in the hands of an independent commission \u2013 taking that power away from incumbent politicians who abuse the process. Democrats in Congress have also recognized the need for independent commissions; the For the People Act (H.R. 1) that passed the House would require independent commissions to draw federal districts.  Legislative action is all the more important in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding that federal courts cannot adjudicate partisan gerrymandering cases. But, unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, have yet to allow a vote on that measure. Until our country puts an end to partisan gerrymandering, politicians will continue to place their own self-interest and the desires of the special interests who fund them over the will of the public. This is true on the urgent issue of gun violence prevention and so many other pressing issues that we face as a country Only when we make our political infrastructure more fair can we ensure that our lawmakers are actually accountable to their constituents \u2013 and truly create a government of the people, by the people, for the people.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. The impeachment of Donald Trump is now an inevitability thanks, not to Congress, but to his own character and personality which drove him to seek foreign help in the 2020 election. When the House declares him worthy of removal from office, however, the very flaws that got Trump to this point \u2013 the absence of humility, lack of integrity and his self-absorption \u2013 will keep him on a destructive path. The President will not be chastened by the awful stain applied to his name. He will, instead, spin up the cruelty and chaos, deepen the division between Americans and stoke fear in all. Extreme defiance is the hallmark Trumpian method. Whatever others find appalling in his behavior he defends and then does some more. This tendency explains why, after he got in trouble for begging Russia to intervene in the 2016 election, which he says was in \u201cjest,\u201d he allegedly did it again in anticipation of 2020. This time he pressured Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations into his Democratic rival Joe Biden and the debunked conspiracy theory holding that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election. When caught in the act, Trump didn\u2019t back away but rather said that Ukraine and China should both investigate the Bidens. In this way, he\u2019s like a child caught breaking a window with a rock who immediately breaks another to show that he\u2019s supposed to be shattering all that glass. You can\u2019t reason with the boy who has knowingly committed an offense when he does it again, right in front of you, and says it is the right thing to do. Are Trump impeachment articles legally flawed? Two experts debate The Washington Post\u2019s count of Trump\u2019s distortions and untruths, which now exceeds 13,000, could well surpass 20,000 before election day. In the wake of impeachment, he\u2019ll likely devote new energy to his reflexive smears. And in his search for targets, no one will be off limits, as his recent attack on teenage activist Greta Thunberg shows. Like his character, Trump\u2019s personality will not change as a result of impeachment. The dark charisma, which he displays so vividly at his rallies, is his superpower. It thrills rank-and-file Trump voters who listen intently for the signals that cue their chanting and cheers. By the time of the next election, Trump will paint his opponent as the devil at the risk of inspiring the far-right fringe. Joseph Ellis: Every president since Washington has been accused of misconduct, but Trump's is off the chart Trump\u2019s other go-to technique involves using threats and inducements to bring others under his control. His bullying of his fellow Republicans has made so many GOP officials spineless that he rarely hears a correcting word from within the party. When Richard Nixon faced impeachment, he had to deal with Republican senators like Barry Goldwater, who spoke truth to power and told him he\u2019d be removed. Trump, by contrast, has the full support of former opponents like Lindsey Graham, who has said he is \u201cnot trying to pretend to be a fair juror,\u201d and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has pledged that he will work in lockstep with the White House and that \u201cthere\u2019s no chance the President is going to be removed from office.\u201d Senate Republicans have pinned their fortunes to Trumpism and he will make them demonstrate their loyalty with outrageous acts, which they will have to endorse. They have assured the wayward Trump that he can stay in office, and thus have given him permission to keep on vandalizing our democracy.  Trump may wait out the Senate proceedings, in order to avoid provoking a Republican or two to vote against him, but the humiliation of becoming just the third president ever to be impeached will inspire him to plan a string of awful stunts. He\u2019ll likely continue to deploy nasty nicknames and to exploit divisive issues \u2013 abortion, racial justice, climate change, election security \u2013 to destructive effect all the way to November 2020. The impeached-but-not-removed President Trump, who has long called any investigation into his actions a witch hunt, will not accept any responsibility for the crisis he created. He has said that the call he made to allegedly twist Zelensky\u2019s arm was \u201cperfect\u201d and this is the claim he will repeat over and over again. Perfection is, in Trump\u2019s mind, his perpetual state. He will see no reason to spare anyone, least of all the nation, from his wrath.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. There is a slow-motion car crash quality to the destruction of democratic norms right now. But we can\u2019t afford to simply fixate on our problems. We need to focus on finding solutions. The good news is that there is a growing awareness that we cannot take our democracy for granted. This is a time to straighten our civic backbones and roll up our sleeves. But healing our nation\u2019s divisions will require more than the corrective of one election. Polarization is deeper than our politics: It has roots in economic and cultural divides that have frayed our sense of national unity and decreased trust between fellow citizens. To fix this, we\u2019ll need to build a citizens\u2019 movement based on something bigger than partisan politics or ideology. It will require policy prescriptions that move our country away from the forces that divide us \u2013 group think and group blame \u2013 and toward the forces that unite us, in the intertwined areas of politics, economics and culture. So, here are nine big ideas (and a few smaller ones) that can help reunite the nation and combat the larger forces of polarization. Politics is, of course, the primary expression of our polarization. But, as I\u2019ve said before, President Donald Trump is a symptom rather than the cause of our divisions. We\u2019re reaping what we\u2019ve sown over decades \u2013 a twisted incentive system that has pushed our parties toward the ideological extremes, making them less functional and less representative of the nation as a whole. If I had to pick one package of prescriptions to heal hyper-partisanship in America, it would be a bundle of these three elections reforms: 1) independent redistricting reform, combined with 2) open primaries and 3) ranked choice voting \u2013 ideas that incentivize the politics of addition rather than division. Let\u2019s start with redistricting reform to correct the rigged system where the party draws district lines to create a maximum number of safe seats. Even Chief Justice John Roberts admitted that \u201cexcessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust,\u201d despite penning a disastrous Supreme Court decision that blocked a federal path to ending the system of redistricting in a party line vote. Asheville's woes are the story of America But state remedies are still available and, after the 2020 election, we will have a once-in-a-decade opportunity to reform redistricting in America. Independent nonpartisan redistricting commissions, combined with open primaries where independents can vote, make elections more competitive and representative, and drive increased turnout. This also gives candidates an incentive to reach out beyond their party\u2019s base during campaigns and when they reach Congress. Ranked choice voting, where voters rank their top choices on the ballot, has recently won support in states like Maine and cities such as New York. It is proving its ability to increase turnout, while providing candidates with a powerful disincentive for \u201cgoing negative\u201d against opponents. Those reforms would help create a more open and representative political process. But they\u2019re not enough. We also need to lower obstacles to voter participation, including automatic voter registration. We need to strengthen voting rights and ballot security, including paper ballot backups in a time when data manipulation is a danger. A more representative and less polarized election process will result in a more representative and less-polarized Congress. And it will change the political bench for statewide and national office, incentivizing bipartisan legislation at every level of government. If we can change the rules, we can change the game. There is political, as well as economic ballast in a strong middle class. And that is what defined America in the middle of the 20th century. But, for decades, the middle class has been squeezed with stagnant wages and lower social mobility. Small businesses have suffered while once proud and thriving Midwest cities have stagnated and declined, leading to huge disparities in regional economies. At the same time, the top one-hundredth of 1% has saw its share of wealth more than quintuple from 1978 to 2012 \u2013 and it has only increased since then. The answer is not to attack liberal capitalist democracy, which has proven to be the most effective means of lifting people out of poverty. But we should reform the rules of the road to ensure that rising tides truly lift all boats. We need to simplify the tax code while closing lobbyist-driven loopholes and incentivizing long-term investment. Corporations should be guided by long-term value creation, rather than driven solely by quarterly earnings reports, as a group of nearly 200 CEOs agreed in a policy proposed by the Business Roundtable. We also need to offer more support for lower and middle-income families with children and middle-class workers.  One way to achieve this is widespread profit sharing, encouraging companies to share a percentage of profit with workers. This would align the interests of labor and management, creating a win-win mindset while boosting stagnant wages. And this is not a new idea \u2013 it dates back to George Washington and can have bipartisan appeal. The concentration of capital in a small number of communities is also fueling our divides. In response, Steve Case\u2019s \u201cRise of the Rest\u201d fund is seeding investment in entrepreneurs in America\u2019s heartland \u2013 rather than a handful of coastal communities. Andrew Yang: As president, I will establish a Department of the Attention Economy Andrew Yang\u2019s presidential campaign has done us all a service by raising awareness of the looming impact of artificial intelligence on the American workforce. As low-skill jobs are increasingly automatized, we\u2019ll need a new commitment to lifelong learning, from apprenticeships to subsidies for worker retraining, while incentivizing more investment in research and development to keep America innovating. The demands of an aging population, the challenge of climate change, the rise of China and the need for a stronger social safety net are likely to require a government somewhat bigger than we\u2019ve had in the recent past. But we should not buy into the idea that we can endlessly spend money and pass the cost on to the next generation. History is clear: Excessive debt is a force that topples empires. We need to return to an abandoned path of fiscal responsibility \u2013 with incentives that seek to grow America\u2019s economic pie rather than simply redistribute it. Democracy depends on an assumption of goodwill between fellow citizens and a shared commitment to the truth. But trust has been declining across every aspect of our culture for decades. At a time when seven in 10 Americans say that our country is in danger of losing its national identity, we need to turn to reassert a common understanding of our shared history, warts and all, by reinvesting in civic education again. Less than a quarter of students in 2014 scored \u201cproficient\u201d or better on a basic civics and American history exam, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Investing in civics education should be an area of bipartisan agreement, spurred at first by philanthropy through organizations like Generation Citizen and Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. American history should be taught through all twelve grades. Students should also be taught the civic virtues that maintain a healthy democracy, including the importance of both diversity and free speech, rather than promoting the illusion that there are any \u201csafe spaces\u201d in life outside of early childhood. Civil disagreement is essential to democracy. Finally, it\u2019s not too much to ask that every graduating high school student be able to pass the same citizenship exam that new immigrants now take. To restore a sense of common purpose across class and racial lines, we may also need to revisit a norm of national service. In addition to military service, expanding AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, even the National Park Service, can play a critical role in increasing the quality of education at home and abroad, improve infrastructure and even mitigate climate change. In exchange for this period of national service, an expanded new G.I. bill can make college education and vocational training more affordable without saddling students with crippling debt. Facebook is allowing politicians to lie openly. It's time to regulate Any prescription to heal America\u2019s polarization would be hopelessly outdated if we did not address the impact of social media on our democracy. Social media and tech platforms have a responsibility not to run knowingly false advertisements or promote intentionally false stories. They must disclose who is paying for digital political ads and crack down on the spread of disinformation \u2013 while we strengthen prohibitions against foreign actors trying to influence our democracy. The Honest Ads Act would require the same disclosures that are required on television and radio right now. This is a no brainer. The profit motive from hate news and fake news might be reduced by moving digital advertising toward attention metrics to measure and monetize reader engagement and loyalty, incentivizing quality over clickbait. But perhaps the single biggest reform would come from social media companies requiring that accounts verify they are real people, rather than bots that bully people and manipulate public opinion. America is living through a civic stress test. Citizens across the political spectrum now realize that \u201cWe the People\u201d can no longer take the stability or success of the American experiment for granted. Restoring American democracy to its fullest form will require building broad new coalitions. As Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution recently wrote in his book \u201cIll Winds,\u201d \u201cliberals, conservatives and independents who want politics to be more open and competitive \u2013 and less toxic and polarizing \u2013 must join together to fight for reforms\u2026a growing number of Americans are ready \u2013  indeed hungry \u2013 for a renewal of our civic virtues.\u201d There are currently nearly 100 citizen groups across our country who have responded to our current civic stress test by rallying in their communities and specific areas of expertise. There are think tanks spanning the center-right like the Niskanen Center and the center-left like Third Way.  There are nonpartisan groups like Unite America focused on creating a more functional government by enacting political reforms and electing pragmatic candidates. There are organizations focused on creating bipartisan problem-solving congressional coalitions like No Labels (which I helped co-found a decade ago) and ambitious efforts to build a third party like the Serve America Movement and local efforts in a half dozen states.  There are groups devoting themselves to increasing civility, from Better Angels to the National Institute for Civil Discourse. There are organizations that advocate for election reform like FairVote, the defense of liberal democracy like the Renew Democracy Initiative, and umbrella organizations like the Bridge Alliance that aim to coordinate the efforts of grassroots reform groups across the country. These are just a few examples of a growing citizens movement to defend our democracy and re-center our republic. There are deep common bonds between these disparate citizen reform groups. All understand our country is in danger of moving even further off-center as the cycle of revenge swings between political activists who demonize people they disagree with. Going forward, we\u2019ll need to build an alternative architecture to support the vital center across politics, policy and the media. This will provide an off-ramp to the destructive cycle of negative partisanship while counter-acting deeply entrenched partisan and ideological interests that have polarized the United States for too long. There will be specific reforms to combat corruption that come out the Trump years \u2013 the need to strengthen government ethics laws, require the release of presidential tax returns, ramp up enforcement against money-launderers, and even create an independent public integrity protection agency at the federal level. Confronting the forces that divide us in a time of populist passions is not an elite preoccupation. It is a defense of America\u2019s best and oldest traditions: the belief that we must \u201cjoin or die,\u201d as Benjamin Franklin warned. This is an all-American movement determined to defend our diverse democracy. It rejects the politics of us against them , understanding that we must transcend our tribalism to survive and thrive, determined to move our country not left or right, but forward.",

He contributes to a variety of outlets, including Atlanta Black Star, ecoWURD and Al Jazeera. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Last-minute presidential candidates such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a managing director at Bain Capital, have entered the race in an effort to promote moderation and defeat progressive Democratic candidates who Wall Street fears. But the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt is actually poised to return to its roots in the real center of mainstream public opinion, in which people believe in an active role for government to improve their lives. In this presidential election season, the party could reclaim the mantle of protecting working people, the middle class and the poor at a time of gaping wealth inequality, when popular opinion increasingly believes billionaires have too much, corporations pay too little in taxes and ordinary people are suffering. This is why, contrary to the concerns of some political leaders and pundits, most prominently former President Barack Obama, the Democratic Party does not risk veering too far to the left. At a recent event with wealthy donors, Obama claimed the \u201caverage American\u201d does not want to \u201ccompletely tear down the system and remake it,\u201d and America \u201cis still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.\u201d Despite running for president and energizing the nation just a decade ago as a center-left candidate with a message of hope and change, Obama seems to think America does not need systemic change, and Democrats should not rock the boat or make any sudden moves. Democrats on Twitter who reject Obama\u2019s warning not to move too far left responded to the former president\u2019s comments with the hashtag #TooFarLeft, which at the time became the top trending tag in the US and the third globally, according to Democratic strategist Peter Daou. Daou, who started the hashtag, wanted to eviscerate the mainstream talking point that social, economic, racial and environmental justice is somehow a radical position. Bloomberg is the last thing we need after Trump Indeed, considering the state of the country, its festering political, economic and social problems and the seeming inability of government to address them, Daou and others who have embraced the hashtag make a good point.  America is not well, and ignoring the symptoms of what ails the nation \u2013 not pushing too far for change \u2013 is what gave us Donald Trump. Consider the status quo with rising inequality, low taxation on the wealthy and corporations, and the dimming life prospects of millennials. For the first time in history, the ultra-rich \u2013 the 400 richest families \u2013 paid a lower tax rate than the bottom 50% of the population in 2018. Also last year, Amazon paid no federal taxes on more than $11 billion in profit, and its employees, like many across the nation, face brutal working conditions. Amazon maintains the company \u201cprovides a safe, quality work environment in which associates are the heart and soul of the customer experience,\u201d according to a spokeswoman. Similarly, FedEx paid zero in taxes after the Trump windfall corporate tax cuts, as was the case with so many companies, while Netflix paid less in taxes than a monthly subscription to their streaming service, according to Bernie Sanders. Obama's warning to 2020 Democrats Earning less money and saddled with more debt than their parents, young people in America, one study finds, cannot afford their health-care needs and are on a trajectory for a shorter life span than generations before them. According to the study, millennials are facing more chronic health issues, depression and suicide than Gen Xers due to the economic crisis, student debt, the opioid crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other issues. The impending health crisis is eroding the earning potential of this younger generation. Wall Street is frightened at the prospect of a progressive in the mold of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, and some billionaires are having a temper tantrum because they refuse to pay their fair share of taxes. A number of big money Democratic donors have vowed to sit out or support Trump if Warren receives the nomination. Bill Gates seemingly has not ruled out voting for Trump if he would otherwise be forced to pay Warren\u2019s wealth tax. The Beltway punditry consensus dictates that Democrats must move center to appeal primarily to the white moderate swing voter or Trump supporter in the Midwest, rather than cultivate a multiracial base and court nonvoters. Establishment and Wall Street Dems are misreading the winds of public sentiment if they believe moderation is a winning political strategy for 2020. There is no constituency for a presidential candidate who prescribes half-measures to put out a fire. And polling indicates that. For example, a  2019 Quinnipiac poll found that 60% of registered voters support a 2% wealth tax on people who own assets over $50 million. The wealth tax concept enjoys support across political parties and all demographic groups. Further, according to a KFF Health Tracking Poll, health care is the leading issue that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the presidential candidates to discuss. Further, according to a poll earlier this year from Politico and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Republicans believe it is \u201cextremely important\u201d for Congress to tackle student debt.  Even while acknowledging the historic diversity in the Democratic field, Obama urges that candidates rein in their messaging. \u201cWe have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election \u2013 just like I did,\u201d Obama said at another event. \u201cYou can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, \u2018Look, I\u2019m part of an American tradition \u2026 of opening up opportunity.\u2019\u201d The former president is mistaken if he believes that in appealing to the electorate, Democrats must tamp down their message and advocate for tweaks in the system rather than systemic reform. This, in a country that touts itself as the \u201cland of opportunity,\u201d yet has one of the lowest rates of socioeconomic mobility. The party of FDR could very well inspire and energize Americans looking for change with policy prescriptions such as Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and free college.",

We tend to think of America today as fractured in just one way \u2013 between Republicans and Democrats \u2013 but the picture is, and always has been, a lot more complex. Religion and race play key roles in dividing the nation, and a look at history shows these fractures have often been severe. Far from being the mediating force in American politics, religion, when put into the mix, makes the political and racial issues of America stand out in graphic relief. It will be incumbent on those of good will in the 2020 election cycle to try and make peace, not war. Given the history of divisiveness in religion in American politics, particularly when it comes to Christianity and presidential politics, that probably won\u2019t be the case. But any hope rests upon acknowledging truth about what holds us apart. History may not provide the best roadmap for possible solutions to the fractures that divide us, but examining some of these inflection points can help us to understand where we find ourselves and how to navigate these tough times. The role of religion in our national political divisions has evolved, but much of today\u2019s difficulty stems from developments set in motion decades before. Consider the candidacy of Al Smith for President of the United States in 1928. Smith, whose Irish parents immigrated to America, was vilified for being Catholic at a time when many immigrants were Catholic, and Catholics were believed by Protestants to be suspect because of the papacy. Many believed that if a Catholic were to become president, the office would be subject to the whims of the Pope, and not for American concerns. That sentiment would carry forward to the 1960 election, when John F. Kennedy, an Irish Catholic, ran for president against Richard M. Nixon, a Quaker. The divisions over Kennedy\u2019s Catholicism didn\u2019t just reflect the fears of mainstream everyday Protestant Americans; for some Protestant leaders and public figures, reactions to Kennedy\u2019s religious beliefs presented an opportunity to seize power by using that fear to their advantage. Their actions represented a growing and interrelated trend in American politics: capitalizing on fear-based religious fervor or racial animosity to direct a political agenda. You can honor Billy Graham, but not in the US Capitol Among these leaders was Reverend Billy Graham, friend to Nixon. Graham would hold a secret meeting of prominent pastors in August 1960 in Montreux, Switzerland, to plan how to mobilize against Kennedy. The pastors met stateside a few days later in New York City, without Graham, but with Norman Vincent Peale, author of \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking\u201d and pastor of the Marble Collegiate church (where Donald Trump attended) as the face of their coalition. Peale, best known today as a formative influence on Trump, was notoriously anti-Catholic and told the gathered ministers, \u201cOur American culture is at stake. I don\u2019t say it won\u2019t survive, but it won\u2019t be what it was.\u201d According to Peale\u2019s biographer Carol George, Peale met with the press after this gathering and shared a group statement, essentially an indictment of the character of the Roman Catholic Church. The event backfired and gave Kennedy the opening to deliver a speech to the Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, assuring the Protestant ministers and others that his Catholic faith would not get in the way of his decision-making ability as president of the United States. Kennedy\u2019s subsequent win did not stop anti-Catholic bias or heal political divisions, but it clearly put religion-based power-brokering into the presidential mainstream. Kennedy made sure to be seen with Billy Graham at a golf game right before his inauguration. Presidential elections are not the only space in which faith and politics have collided. Religion has often been the staging ground for stoking more localized fears as well \u2013 especially around issues of race. The civil rights movement was fraught with these divisions. The secretive religious group shaping politics The White Citizen\u2019s Council, (WCC) started in 1954 in Indianola, Mississippi, formed in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, and councils soon sprang up in communities across the South. Believing that many of the people involved in the civil rights movement were communists, the WCC \u2013 most of whose participants were church members and whose violent activism was hidden behind strong statements about citizenship, politics, and morality \u2013 employed strategic ways to hit back at the civil rights movement in cities in the South. In order to stop the Montgomery Bus Boycott led by Martin Luther King Jr., for example, the WCC pushed insurance companies to cancel auto insurance policies issued to black churches throughout the South. Members also were responsible for violence throughout the South, including the murder of Mississippi activist Medgar Evers. WCC members are also believed to have bombed King\u2019s home. In addition to civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s, religious voices also helped to shape debates in the 1970s over the role of the church on women\u2019s rights. Black and white women would come together to support organizations like the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the Equal Rights Amendment. Take for example Pauli Murray, a queer African American lawyer and civil rights advocate who began to argue in the 1960s that the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment should apply to gender and sex discrimination, as well as to race. Murray was religious and a staunch advocate for civil rights and equal rights who co-founded the National Organization of Women, supported the Equal Rights Amendment and in 1977 became an Episcopal priest. In contrast, Catholic laywoman Phyllis Schlafly mobilized evangelical white women against the ERA with the Stop ERA Campaign. Schlafly became the face of a formidable conservative force that declared victory in defeating the ERA, and would go on to join forces with other evangelical political action committees in the 1980s by establishing the Eagle Forum to promote the concerns of right-wing Christians. And perhaps no political issue has been more shaped by religious division than abortion, which brought together two groups who had opposed each other in 1960: white evangelical Protestants and white Catholics. Following the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973, the anti-abortion movement brought these two groups together in an effort led in part by a man, Francis Schaeffer, who would awaken evangelicals like Jerry Falwell to the pro-life cause and motivate him to recruit others to the fold. These pro-life evangelicals would become a potent political force and form the backbone of the so-called \u201creligious right.\u201d Trump tape reveals religious right hypocrisy Integration was also a galvanizing issue for the religious right, thanks to the 1971 tax-related ruling by a federal court in  Green v. Connally, which stated that private schools could lose their tax exemptions if they discriminated on the basis of race (a decision backed up by the IRS and later the Supreme Court). The test case for religious institutions was Bob Jones University, which did not at the time admit African Americans. After a series of failed moves designed to get around the law, the university ended up having their tax status rescinded \u2013 a moment that helped galvanize evangelical leaders, including Falwell, to form the Moral Majority \u2013 a predominately white clergy organization \u2013 in 1979. The rise of the religious right as a political force would prove a boon for Ronald Reagan, which in turn offered a reciprocal and lasting boost to the religious conservatives\u2019 political fortunes. In a campaign address on religious liberty, Reagan would indicate his support for the Moral Majority and evangelicals by saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t endorse me, but I can endorse you.\u201d Reagan\u2019s ascendancy in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s energized evangelicals and religious conservatives in the 1980s and beyond, mostly across racial lines. For example, Falwell defended the pro-apartheid government in South Africa, while black churches supported the anti-apartheid movement and figures like Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu. This decade also brought the growth of organizations like James Dobson\u2019s Focus on the Family, Family Research Council (co-founded by Dobson with Tony Perkins, Gary Bauer and George Alan Rekers) and Donald Wildmon\u2019s American Family Association. These were ostensibly church-related organizations dedicated to family issues and became powerful lobbying organizations in Washington aligning themselves with the Republican Party. These organizations often found themselves at odds not only with those on the political left, but also with black churches and communities of color who did not benefit from the strict moral and fiscal policies these groups often espoused. They also promoted the business of politics and religion by raising funds and selling promotional materials, becoming multi-million dollar businesses that did not pay taxes while lobbying lawmakers and wielding influence in local, state and national government.  Meanwhile, some black churches, like Eddie Long\u2019s New Birth in Atlanta, embraced the prosperity gospel, a belief that God wants to bless Christians financially and materially who believe, tithe and give offerings to the church. Long would gain notoriety for rallying for a constitutional march in December 2004 protecting marriage between one man and one woman during the George W. Bush presidency. The issue of same-sex marriage would be one of the defining political divisions of the early 2000s, in part because many black churches sided with conservative evangelicals in their opposition to gay marriage. This newly-forged political alliance between some black and white evangelical Christians around anti-gay-marriage sentiment would lead some black voters to vote for George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, and to subsequently speak out against President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage as well. During the 2012 election, some black pastors questioned whether they could vote for Obama\u2019s re-election \u2013 notably Jamal Bryant, who said church leaders supporting same-sex marriage were \u201chypocrites.\u201d Same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights more broadly have continued to be a flashpoint among black and white evangelical voters, even after the Supreme Court upheld marriage equality. This extended history shows that across decades, in local and national scope, religious institutions have been intertwined with political movements and become instruments of political division. Still, none of these chasms could have predicted the abiding divisions of the 2016 election cycle, in which white evangelicals would once again side with Republicans and Trump, whose animosity for immigrants and ethnic groups is well documented. Trump\u2019s popularity with leading evangelical Christians brings a lot of 20th-century religious history full circle. He attended Peale\u2019s church, and two of his most prominent supporters are Falwell\u2019s namesake son, now the president of Liberty University, and Billy Graham\u2019s son Franklin. The divisions in Trump\u2019s presidency are carved deep, those divisions echo new versions of a familiar song. Perhaps what the Trump era has laid bare is how nakedly church leaders\u2019 support of him is about political power.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Stacey Abrams is the former Democratic leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia and the Founder of Fair Fight Action and Fair Count. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN. On Wednesday, the presidential candidates will gather for their next debate in Georgia, the location of one of the most egregious and successful voter suppression efforts in recent history. For those who value our nation\u2019s commitment to democracy, the issue of voter suppression is directly linked to whether the voice of the people is heard. The Supreme Court\u2019s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder led to a surge in voter suppression measures in Georgia and other previously covered jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voter suppression, as well as states facing demographic changes that threaten incumbents\u2019 political power. This weakening of federal law has had its desired effect on our nation\u2019s electoral process. The obstacles to voting now come in a dizzying array of constraints: voter roll purges in Ohio and Georgia, polling place closures in Arizona and North Carolina, newly erected barriers for college students in Texas and New Hampshire, signature mismatch laws to disqualify ballots in Michigan and Florida and unduly restrictive voter ID laws in Iowa and Wisconsin. Our lax cybersecurity policies put our elections and our data at risk When powerful forces pick their voters through intimidation and restriction, using bureaucracy to thwart participation, government fails to respond to the needs of its people. In a democracy, when leaders fail to listen to the people they represent, the system is broken. However, voter suppression is simply one tool in a broad agenda designed to reshape all three branches of government to benefit a shrinking minority. Such behavior is not new in politics, but with the upcoming elections, voters must be aware of the threat facing our national identity. Power in our current democracy is determined not by popular will but by arcane and undemocratic rules. Our Congressional districts are manipulated by partisan gerrymandering. The Senate structure is so unrepresentative that the nearly 580,000 people of Wyoming are allocated an identical number of senators as the nearly 40 million residents of California. The Electoral College has usurped the will of the American people twice\u2013 the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections \u2013 in the last five elections. Broadly popular legislation passed by one legislative body is dead on arrival in the other chamber, blocking progress not by the people\u2019s choice but by an algorithm of absurdity. Meanwhile, the unprecedented theft of a Supreme Court seat in 2017 has left us with a highly politicized, illegitimate and ideologically extreme Supreme Court. 79-year-old Marian paved the way for your right to vote Voters wonder aloud at the security of election machines judged untrustworthy by cyber-experts. Worse, the President of the United States blithely encourages foreign interference in our elections, marking the erosion of accountability and corruption at the highest levels of office. A paralyzed Congress has failed to pass even the most rudimentary of solutions \u2013 leaving citizens with little to pin their hopes on in the next election. However, despite the broken machinery, Americans are aligned on a key set of issues stuck in legislative gridlock. Eighty-nine % of Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases , according to an NBC- Wall Street Journal survey.  A 2019 Gallup poll found that 81% want a clear path to US citizenship for immigrants. Seventy-five % believe Roe v. Wade should remain the law of the land, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. And 66%  of Americans, according to a Gallup poll, agree to \u201csetting higher emissions standards for automobiles\u201d  and oppose the President\u2019s \u201cplan to freeze fuel efficiency standards.\u201d But we cannot make progress on these issues \u2013 or on healthcare, job creation or civil rights \u2013 unless we fix our democracy first. Russia likely to focus on voter suppression in 2020, feds warn states The way forward is clear. Leaders from labor, progressive, racial and social justice, civic reform, grassroots, environmental and reproductive rights groups recognize that meaningful change on any single issue requires a combined effort to reset democracy\u2019s fundamentals. As I press for an expansion of voting rights and a full and accurate Census count, I do so because I understand how the right to vote and inclusion in the story of America set the stage for change. Yet, battling voter suppression must be met by federal action to permanently protect voting rights. An accurate Census deserves fair laws that do not privilege incumbents over voters. A popular vote for our nation\u2019s leader would signal a necessary rebuke of racism and classism, and it will require candidates to make every state a priority lest any vote be missed. I invite all political leaders to join me in supporting a democracy agenda that gives Americans a voice in their government. This agenda includes ending all forms of voter suppression, restoring the Voting Rights Act, enacting automatic voter registration, creating fair districts with independent redistricting commissions, allowing the people who live in Washington, DC, to have full representation, giving self-determination to the people of Puerto Rico, court reform, rooting out corruption in politics and reforming rules in order to allow governance over gridlock. These fundamental changes will allow our democracy to work.  We are a mighty nation because we embedded in our national experiment the chance to fix what is broken and to demand fairness and equality by calling out what has faltered. Improving democracy is part of our DNA as Americans. When African Americans and women were denied the right to vote, we changed our Constitution. After the Great Depression, we updated our banking laws. In the wake of Watergate, we reformed our campaign finance laws. We are again in a moment where urgent, structural change is required to ensure our institutions operate in service of our people. With a renewed commitment and a bold agenda to protect the democratic process, we will create a stronger America.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d This piece has been adapted from her Saturday evening show monologue. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. Oh, the arrogance. I was recently talking to one of my friends, a former Bill Clinton operative, about the unique properties a special category of people have in common. The category is Humans Who Run for President of the United States. The unique properties are, in a word, an outsized sense of self. A level of arrogance is, by definition, required. Imagine believing you can solve unwieldy, complex, centuries-old, systemic problems that others heretofore have not, that your singular genetic and experiential alchemy makes you the best person to lead a nation, that you can in fact defeat dozens of other capable and qualified candidates to be the last man or woman standing. Then imagine thinking all that, while being one of the most divisive politicians to run for president \u2013 and fail twice, once to a member of your own party and once to Donald J. Trump. Welcome to Hillary Clinton\u2019s mind. Clinton, once again, refused this week to rule out a 2020 presidential bid, insisting she was hearing from plenty of people who wanted her to jump in. Clinton has advice for Dems running against Trump in 2020 \u201cI, as I say, never, never, never say never,\u201d she said in a radio interview Tuesday. \u201cI will certainly tell you, I\u2019m under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it.\u201d This echoes other flirtations, including a tweet warning Trump, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d Good grief. This Democratic field of candidates is the most diverse in the history of the presidency. There\u2019s not only a racial and ethnic diversity of backgrounds, but a diversity of experience \u2013 there are senators, congressional members, past and current mayors, governors, businessmen and even a self-help guru. There\u2019s also a diversity of ideas, from far-left progressive policies to more moderate and incremental views of how to fix broken systems. There\u2019s a diversity of age and geographical appeal. If voters can\u2019t find something they like from this field, it likely doesn\u2019t exist. And it\u2019s finally begun to consolidate, with voters lining up behind a handful of frontrunner candidates. This is the way it\u2019s supposed to go \u2013 the process is working just fine, despite the anxieties of Democratic donors who believe a late entrant like Hillary Clinton or Michael Bloomberg is needed to save Democratic voters from themselves. But Clinton, especially, isn\u2019t the answer. The biggest question facing voters in 2020 While she won the popular vote in 2016, she\u2019s hardly popular. According to an October Fox News poll, 54% of registered voters have a negative opinion of her. Only 41% have a positive opinion. Over the course of the yearlong election, her unfavorable ratings went up \u2013 starting at 51% unfavorable in November 2015, and ending at 54.4% unfavorable in November 2016, according to Real Clear Politics\u2019 poll average. In short, the more people saw, the less they liked. As polarizing as Trump was and is, so too was Clinton. In May of 2016, as FiveThirtyEight noted, both Clinton and Trump were more strongly disliked than any nominee at that point in the past 10 presidential cycles. You\u2019d think that nearly three years of Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric, his utter incompetence, his embarrassing foibles on the world stage, would have put a fresh coat of paint on Clinton\u2019s reputation. You\u2019d think wrong. The history lesson 2020 Democrats can't afford to ignore Even now, she is outpolled by her fellow Democrats in the primary, all of whom are more popular now than she was in 2016. If this doesn\u2019t sound like a recipe for success in 2020, well, you must be people not named Hillary Clinton, who still seems to think she could be what the nation is clamoring for. But that\u2019s not because the nation is thinking \u2013 a whopping 75% of Democratic voters are satisfied with the current field. More likely, nostalgia for what could have been is clouding the judgment of those who wish she were running now, including, perhaps, Clinton herself:  \u201cLook, I think all the time about what kind of president I would\u2019ve been and what I would\u2019ve done differently and what I think it would\u2019ve meant to our country and our world,\u201d she said Tuesday. Imagine wondering what you would have meant to our country and our world \u2013 and then you won\u2019t have a hard time imagining Hillary Clinton imagining herself running for president again.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cGet over it.\u201d So advised White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney Thursday. The staggering thing was exactly what he was admonishing folks to get over \u2013 get over the quid pro quo that, Mulvaney admitted, President Donald Trump had engaged in with Ukraine, withholding military aid until the Ukrainian president agreed to probe a debunked tale about 2016 election interference. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d he said on live TV. \u201cGet over it.\u201d After a press briefing whose first bombshell was that President Donald Trump will hold next year\u2019s G7 summit at his own financially troubled property (Trump National in Doral, Florida), almost no one took Mulvaney\u2019s advice. So few opted to get over it, in fact\u2014including Republicans and a reportedly rattled President\u2013 that hours later Mulvaney denied ever saying those words. He went from what Paul Begala called the President\u2019s \u201cyes-man\u201d into a \u201chey, I didn\u2019t really mean it\u201d-man. A real chief of staff, Begala argued, is someone who doesn\u2019t hesitate to say \u201cno sir\u201d to the commander in chief: \u201cThose words never seem to emerge from Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s mouth,\u201d wrote Begala. \u201cFar from being a public servant, the acting chief of staff revealed himself to be a throne-sniffer of the worst order. If he were any more of a toady, he\u2019d be catching flies with his tongue.\u201d And after significant backlash, Trump reversed course Saturday to say the G7 won\u2019t be held at Doral after all. Mulvaney\u2019s floundering capped a week of new impeachment-inquiry intrigue,  after Fiona Hill, who used to direct Russian and European affairs for the National Security Council, testified that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his possible 2020 rival Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. In Michael D\u2019Antonio\u2019s assessment, \u201cthe testimony of Fiona Hill \u2013 and the role of national security adviser John Bolton \u2013 may eventually become inciting incidents in a narrative that could rival Watergate as a political tragedy caused by a single man\u2019s self-delusion.\u201d Throw in the tough testimony from current and former administration officials facing House questioning (and those who have already testified), Samantha Vinograd pointed out, and \u201cthis may be the tip of the iceberg.\u201d More smart takes: \u2013 Jill Filipovic: Trump family throws stones at Biden from a glass house \u2013 Elie Honig: Your impeachment questions, answered The sudden passing of Congressman Elijah Cummings \u2013 chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and veteran of the Civil Rights Movement \u2013 drew immediate and bipartisan outpourings of respect for a man who served in Congress for over two decades and served his community of Baltimore (and others) for far longer. The Rev. Jesse Jackson remembered Cummings as \u201ca man of dignity and discipline,\u201d his \u201cbeloved brother;\u201d he said \u201cit has been one of the great joys of my life to watch the nation get to know, respect and admire this great patriot, public servant and man of God.\u201d Both the Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy eulogized Cummings in the Washington Post. Pelosi called Cummings \u201cour North Star\u201d and paid tribute to his accomplishments as a legislator and mentor, a \u201cgenerous leader.\u201d Gowdy recounted moments when Cummings had been critical or disagreed with him, but dismissed all that: \u201cIt\u2019s not the hearings or political squabbles I\u2019ll remember. I\u2019ll remember his laugh. I\u2019ll remember the commanding voice that made him the most compelling orator in Congress. I\u2019ll remember his hand coming toward mine to let me know that a piece of advice was headed my way, once I stopped talking.\u201d Historian Peniel Joseph echoed the thoughts of many when he deemed Cummings\u2019 passing \u201ca major loss to American politics\u2026It is especially poignant for Cummings\u2019 constituents (and the rest of us) to be suddenly faced with the task of mourning a man of his history and stature at a time when both the civil rights activism and public service he embodied seem by many to be under attack.\u201d President Trump should be extremely concerned, wrote SE Cupp. He\u2019s at risk of losing his party\u2019s support \u2013 and his presidency \u2013 after abandoning Kurdish allies by pulling American troops out of Syria. Cupp broke it down this way: \u201cIt should tell us something that Republicans, who are usually so protective of this President\u2026have spoken out so vocally and unilaterally against him when it came to Syria.\u201d She warned that \u201cif he decides not to listen, it\u2019s an excuse for Republican lawmakers, who may have secretly been looking for an opportunity, to break ranks, and at the worst possible time for the President \u2013 when impeachment is actually on the table.\u201d This decision was so \u201cincoherent, contradictory and harmful,\u201d observed Frida Ghitis, that it is all the more \u201cimperative that we find out what was behind it.\u201d Ghitis was emphatic: \u201cUnder normal circumstances, we might shake our heads at Trump\u2019s decision; call it a horrible mistake and make the best of it. But these are not normal circumstances, and this is not just any poor tactical move. This foreign policy travesty demands answers.\u201d In the National Review, Jim Talent offered a different view. \u201cI don\u2019t see the criticism,\u201d he opined, arguing that the President simply used the options he had in Syria. After Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, announced a ceasefire and agreement with Turkey, David Andelman argued that \u201cwith a single stroke,\u201d Trump has re-aligned the Middle East, having \u201ceffectively brought a newly resurgent and potent triad \u2013 Syria, Russia and Iran\u2014to the very doorstep of their declared enemy, Israel, and given aid and comfort to a longtime and persistent foe, Hezbollah, in Lebanon.\u201d Another smart take: \u2013 Retired general Wesley Clark: Syria pullback looks like an open door to disaster Writing anonymously at her request, the wife of a Special Operations soldier who has served throughout the Middle East addressed a letter directly to Kurdish soldiers. For her, they are not nameless or faceless abstractions. Her husband told her of how the Kurds helped him and other soldiers stay safe during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, she wrote. \u201cThank you for your friendship,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor keeping your word and fighting alongside us, for staying the course year after year. Thank you for keeping my husband safe so he could come back home to me and my children. You have my sincerest prayers today that you too may safely return to yours. Thank you to your families that sacrificed without you, so you could make this partnership happen. I pray we return to your side, that we stand by you, and that this has not all been in vain.\u201d For at least 24 hours this week, all you had to say was \u201cthe photo\u201d and many people would know just what you meant. The image of Nancy Pelosi, standing up and staring down the President at a table ringed by white male political leaders, pinged around the internet and the evening news. Trump tweeted it and called her \u201cunhinged;\u201d the House speaker one-upped him by making it her Twitter wallpaper. The image became what Molly Roberts described in the Washington Post as \u201ca Rorschach test for an America cleaved into two. Tell us what you see, and we\u2019ll tell you which world you\u2019re living in.\u201d \u201cWe see you, Nancy Pelosi,\u201d wrote Roxanne Jones \u2013 \u201cwe cannot look away from that photo, cannot stop sharing it across social media, or, thinking about what it means for us \u2013 all the women who have found themselves in a similar position in workplaces across America.\u201d For Jones, the photo also was, for many black and brown women, \u201ca painful reminder of the privilege that white men, and, yes, white women, lord over all of us in the workplace.\u201d At the fourth Democratic debate, held in Ohio on Tuesday night, there was no doubt who the candidates believe is their new frontrunner: Senator Elizabeth Warren. Writing in CNN Opinion\u2019s live commentary blog, David Axelrod outlined the perils of being out front: the upstarts come at you. Axelrod noted the strong hits Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg had for Warren and concluded that \u201cshe will be left to parry attacks like the ones her opponents launched tonight.\u201d Commentators had much to say about the Democratic faceoff. SE Cupp and Scott Jennings zeroed in on Warren\u2019s non-answer on how to pay for Medicare for All; Tara Setmayer thought Mayor Pete Buttigieg seemed  \u201cpresidential.\u201d Republican Alice Stewart and Democrat Joe Lockhart ranked the winners coming out of the evening \u2013 listing Warren and Klobuchar, respectively, at the top. Debate coach Todd Graham graded Bernie Sanders as the debate\u2019s star, with Kamala Harris \u2013 and her powerful moment on the subject of abortion \u2013 as a close second. Writing before the debate, Fatima Goss Graves insisted that in this and future debates, moderators must step up to hold candidates to account on issues too often dismissed as \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d \u2013 like abortion, childcare, equal pay and sexual harassment. Writing for Bloomberg Opinion, Joan C. Williams diagnosed this balkanizing of identity-based issues as a systemic problem for Democratic candidates. Separating race and class when presenting their agendas won\u2019t work, she pointed out: \u201cIn the matchup with a Republican racial-fear message, a Democratic colorblind economic message loses.\u201d More smart takes \u2013 Julian Zelizer: Here is what we really need to be debating \u2013 Aaron David Miller: Trump is re-writing the rulebook on incumbency Dipayan Ghosh observed that Tuesday\u2019s debate also \u201cfeatured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley.\u201d The moment between Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, fueled in part by a new Facebook policy that the company \u201cwould not seek to fact-check or censor politicians,\u201d opening a \u201cfrightening new world for political communication \u2014 and for national politics\u2026in which leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion.\u201d The debate previewed for Ghosh \u201cwhat will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg was quick to strike back against Facebook\u2019s critics; in a speech at Georgetown and an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, he argued that Facebook \u201cstands for free expression.\u201d In the Guardian, Siva Vaidhyanathan rebuffed Zuckerberg\u2019s claim, contending that Zuckerberg \u201cwants our discussions to be as abstract and idealistic as possible. He wants us not to look too closely at Facebook itself.\u201d Morgan G. Ames, writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, debunked as a \u201cmyth\u201d the idea of \u201ctechies\u201d to be \u201cmoral or thought leaders\u201d in the first place. The killing of Atatiana Jefferson by a police officer in Fort Worth left communities across the country feeling less safe. Sharon Grigsby wrote in the Dallas Morning News that she felt \u201cangry and outraged.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for this to stop,\u201d wrote veteran law enforcement officer Cedric L. Alexander. Police departments must start asking themselves key questions or face loss of their very legitimacy. \u201cWho are we hiring?\u2026 How are we training our officers?\u2026Who is supervising them?\u2026 Without the answers, we cannot begin to restore the legitimacy of law enforcement in our neighborhoods and in our nation.\u201d Last week, after backlash against Elizabeth Warren brought pregnancy discrimination into the national conversation, we asked our readers to weigh in. I wrote about and compiled your amazing stories, which ranged from the 1960s, when it was perfectly legal to, say, ask a female job candidate the date of her last period (just to make sure she couldn\u2019t be pregnant), to the present day, when pregnancy discrimination is technically illegal but rears its head for men and women alike. Readers shared stories of not just working parenthood but miscarriage, adoption and difficult pregnancies. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans \u2013 past and present \u2013 who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers. As reader Sarah S. wrote to us, \u201cI\u2019m due in January. Things need to change.\u201d Another smart take: \u2013 Elizabeth Yuko, writing for #NationalPeriodDay: Just say it. I\u2019m menstruating \u2013 Kara Alaimo: As a new mom, I found Meghan\u2019s interview gut-wrenching \u2013 Peggy Drexler: This may be the secret to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter\u2019s amazingly long marriage \u2013 Errol Louis: Trump supporters\u2019 video carries stomach-turning message \u2013 Ford Vox and Arthur Caplan: The Surgeon General is shirking his job \u2013 Allison Hope: This health care ruling could endanger untold numbers of LGBTQ Americans \u2013 Christopher Douglas: The GM workers\u2019 strike probably isn\u2019t worth it (for CNN Business Perspectives) The HBO show just concluded its first season, and Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons deemed it not only a successful and well-written comedy but also a critique that skewers pro-Trump evangelicals\u2019 real-life hypocrisies. Whether considered alongside the political proclivities of Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr., Franklin Graham and Ralph Reed (among others) or taken on its own, Graves-Fitzsimmons declares the show\u2019s first season a \u201cjaundiced satire [that] offers a mirror to the hypocrisies of big-dollar evangelicalism in America today. Many of today\u2019s most prominent leaders would give the Gemstones a run for their money in making a gold-plated joke of evangelicalism.\u201d Graves-Fitzsimmons, a progressive Christian writer and activist, reflected: \u201cStill, I find hope in seeing more and more Americans recognize the Gemstones of the world as the antithesis of what it means to follow Jesus Christ.\u201d",

Read more opinion on CNN. Hope took center stage during CNN\u2019s Climate Town Hall Wednesday night. The optimistic message that the 10 presidential candidates managed to find for tackling our greatest existential threat was this: Addressing climate change isn\u2019t about preventing the worst, it\u2019s about mustering our energy and creativity to win a better future. We watched the participants for seven hours straight put forth the most ambitious climate plans we have seen in a generation. At a deeper level, we witnessed the rebirth of a positive, creative, and powerful environmentalism for the Democratic Party \u2013 one rooted in the lives, values, and needs of millions of ordinary people impacted by climate change who want a better future. The green economy can create a ladder up and out of poverty, and the candidates described in detail how they will make it happen. From electrifying our nation\u2019s cars, trucks, and buses to installing community-owned solar and wind turbines to rebuilding our nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, we can create economic opportunity and green-collar jobs even in the most depressed areas in our country. Here are seven things that gave us hope: No one had to waste time on Wednesday debating whether climate change is happening. Every single candidate on that stage was taking the climate crisis seriously and had a plan to tackle it. The town hall may not have shifted voters\u2019 opinion of who they will support, but one thing is certain: the preparation candidates had to do before taking the stage had clearly helped them to become more informed about climate change and more equipped to face one of the greatest challenges of our time. The audience probably learned a few things, too. This wasn\u2019t a hypothetical discussion about how to prevent a future climate threat. This was a series of conversations about what is happening to people right now and what they will do if elected president to help struggling Americans. Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar proposed solutions to support farmers with incentives for winter cover crops that help sequester carbon in the soil. Many candidates, including Julian Castro, talked about the need to invest in environmental justice for communities of color. Harris on Trump: Lead or get out of the way Resiliency plans to help people facing flooding in the Gulf Coast and fires in the West were strong topics. And we heard several candidates emphasize the importance of supporting coal miners and impacted workers during the transition to a clean energy economy. It was a conversation grounded in the lived experience of everyday people with a focus on improving people\u2019s lives. Candidates seemed more ready and more willing to hold polluters accountable than ever before. Every candidate recognized that the cost of pollution is too high. American taxpayers are subsidizing fossil fuel industry profits in dollars, sickness, and lost lives \u2013 a cost candidates hope to recover through a price on carbon that would force the largest polluters to pay to clean up their own mess. Beyond that, multiple candidates said they would end Citizens United and crack down on big money\u2019s corrupting influence in politics. Warren: This is what fossil fuel wants us talking about Sen. Kamala Harris, when asked whether she would sue a company like Exxon Mobil, said, \u201cI have sued Exxon Mobil.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that while she\u2019s not opposed to people making a profit, she is opposed to them doing it at the expense of others. She would create and enforce strict rules for companies to protect clean air and water for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, Andrew Yang said it\u2019s time to end fossil fuel subsidies and put those dollars to work for the American people. Environmental justice was a theme throughout the town halls, with most, if not all of the candidates pledging to invest funds directly into low-income communities and communities of color to ensure all neighborhoods have clean air, clean water and are climate resilient. This is a major shift that signals just how far the environmental movement has come. Joe Biden: We can take millions of vehicles off the road Booker talked about how green solutions can tackle climate and bring healthy foods to urban neighborhoods. Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would invest in expanding public transit service, which would take millions of cars off the road and help people in isolated neighborhoods reach jobs, education, and health care more affordably and efficiently. Pete Buttigieg called climate change a question of social and racial justice and educated viewers on the historic practices of redlining which forced black and brown communities into neighborhoods now more prone to pollution and vulnerable to climate change impacts. All of this left us with hope that we can close the divide between the eco-haves and eco-have nots to build a better future for all. Throughout the night candidates faced questions about how they would address the fears coal miners and fossil fuel workers have about losing their jobs. Almost every candidate recognized we can\u2019t leave anyone behind. Klobuchar shared that her grandfather was a coal miner and said these workers need support during a difficult transition. Senator Bernie Sanders was more specific, saying that \u201cthe coal miners in this country, the men and women who work on the oil rigs, they are not my enemy \u2026 we\u2019re going to guarantee them an income for five years and the education they need (for the jobs of the future).\u201d Last night, Warren put the longstanding fears that green jobs won\u2019t be good jobs to rest, saying she would create more than one million new manufacturing jobs that are \u201cgood jobs, union jobs, not just jobs that pay less, not jobs that are an afterthought, but real jobs.\u201d She described a vision for a new economy that doesn\u2019t measure success by the profits of those at the top, but also by the conditions of every worker who powers the economy. Bold ideas and campaign promises are great, but the next president must recognize they will inherit a deeply divided country. They need to have the vision and leadership qualities it will take to heal divides, build broad public support for the solutions we need most, and work with Congress to pass real, lasting reform. We\u2019ve already seen how easy it is to undo executive actions when administrations turn over, so legislation will be a critical path for long-lasting change.  The good news is, several candidates understand this. Booker said he has been able to find \u201ccommon purpose\u201d with unlikely allies. Klobuchar, when answering a question about what type of carbon pricing measures she would support, said she will need to see who is in Congress to see how far she can take it, signaling an inclination to work in a pragmatic, bipartisan manner. Biden touted his record on being able to build bipartisan support as well. Meanwhile, Buttigieg said, \u201cwe have to actually unify the country around (climate solutions). That means bringing people to the table who haven\u2019t felt they have been part of the process.\u201d These are signs we are on the right track. In the stroke of one election, Americans can fight climate change and put the country on course to building a better future for all.",

Lindsay, is chairman of the board, emeritus, at Adelphi University and a senior adviser for the Committee to Protect the Journalists. He has written for The American Scholar, the Los Angeles Review of Books and Essays in Criticism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. Some days, America gets a reassuring sign that President Trump has a sense of the responsibility and stature of the office he holds. When he spoke of \u201cthe love, the respect for the office of the presidency\u201d he encountered in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, or when he called upon China to be \u201chumane\u201d in dealing with the Hong Kong protesters or when he said that while no one could surpass his support for the Second Amendment, he did not want guns in the \u201chands of a lunatic or a maniac,\u201d he thereby acknowledged the place the presidency holds in confronting violence and the prospect of chaos. And yet those moments are short-lived. It is never long before the President\u2019s communications become prickly and personalized, combatively thin-skinned. Something deep and reflexive seems to overtake him. The presidency never fully inhabits him nor inhibits him. We saw this in Texas after the El Paso shooting, where the community at large, bruised by past statements and the day\u2019s horror, never felt words or gestures of presidential comfort and sympathy that were offered in the hospital. Shock, anxiety and anger naturally had taken hold, and perhaps because the White House wanted to avoid emotional displays of hurt, resentment and demands for action on gun control, Trump never spoke in public. And once again, the ground of disagreement quickly became a launching pad for disparagement. What infuriates Trump is an accusation or a call for accountability, any comment that points toward his words or actions as a cause for what has gone wrong. Israel's ban on Omar and Tlaib is a big mistake It feels hopeless to think that Trump will ever admit that anything he may have said or done has helped to fray the material of civility and ignite the chemistry of estrangement among young men, especially white young men. His claim that \u201cmy rhetoric brings people together,\u201d which he absurdly mustered with a straight face, betrays his pathological aversion to taking responsibility for his own acts. This behavior runs to all things. The shiver this week running through the stock market and bond prices, the specter of recession and the role that erratic moves on tariffs have played, are met by the President blaming it entirely on the Federal Reserve. To read of Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledging after the report of the Ethics Commission that he made mistakes in a case involving a Canadian company or to see the sign held up in the Hong Kong airport by protesters asking that their mistakes in causing inconvenience to travelers be forgiven are reminders of what we won\u2019t hear from our President. Trump's reelection nightmare We saw this over and over again with regard to Russian interference in our elections. The President claims no part at all in encouraging it and moreover has taken no measures to meet his high responsibility for preventing fully documented Russian efforts to sabotage our basic instrument of democracy. He cannot do so because in his mind there can\u2019t be the slightest admission that he or his election team have done anything wrong or benefited from Russian actions in the 2016 election \u2013 or that in any way, his victory might have been tainted. We have reached a point where the convolutions of President Trump\u2019s mind, his adherence to Roy Cohn\u2019s never-give-an-inch legal advice and the fact that everything is seen now through the prism of the 2020 reelection campaign combine to dampen any hope of enlarging the President\u2019s sensibilities, which would take him outside of himself.  He seeks justification in his opponents, whom he characterizes as promoting open borders, encouraging racial divisiveness and employing political opportunism.  As with his efforts to vilify the media, Trump\u2019s character and way of thinking continue to harden in their antagonism.  And Trump delights in being small, in stooping to conquer, as seen by how he convinced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reject the application of two congresswomen to visit Israel. Our nation is now bound in knots tied by the inseparable politics and psychology of its president, each force tightening the other and diminishing every day the dignity, integrity and persuasiveness of the holder of our highest office.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his solely own. View more opinion at CNN. Scholars say that the identification of crimes against humanity began in the late 18th century with cries against the slave trade or against atrocities such as those in the Belgian Congo.  The concept was recognized formally in 1915 when the Allied Powers issued a declaration condemning the mass killing of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.  And of course they were formally prosecuted in the Nuremberg Trials after World War II.  These are heinous crimes, often genocides, against a set of targeted people, and prosecuted at an international level. These actions were arguably legal under the regimes in which they were carried out but not in the eyes of the world. On a much different scale, we should be thinking of crimes against democracy \u2013 actions perhaps legal in letter but not in fostering the basic concepts, values and processes of democracy, and particularly, American democracy. If we look back in US history, we can see examples of this. Poll taxes, grandfather clauses and impossible literacy tests aimed at restricting former slaves from voting lasted in this country for almost a hundred years before the Supreme Court found them unconstitutional. Newer forms of voter suppression may not all be unconstitutional but nevertheless fall within this definition of crimes against democracy. 2020 election is a test America can't afford to fail Some crimes against democracy, like voter fraud and vote manipulation (e.g., changing the results reported via computer hack), are also actual crimes. Certainly, voter manipulation from a foreign power, as was the case during the 2016 presidential election, would fit into this category . When these types of crimes directly affect a vote, as the examples above do, they are easy to spot. But it is harder when one thinks about how they might apply to actions of a legislative body. We\u2019ve seen how this unfolds when officials choose their party over democratic values and processes.  For example, when the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature, in a lame duck session after the election of a Democratic governor in 2016, significantly stripped the powers of the governorship, and Wisconsin did the same in 2018, that should be a crime against democracy \u2013 not prosecutable but an offense nevertheless. Is Justice Roberts the new SCOTUS swing vote? When the Democratic senators in Wisconsin left the state borders in a 2011 boycott because they were outvoted by the Republican majority on an anti-union measure and wanted to deny a quorum,  and Oregon Republican senators did the same in 2019 to avoid climate change legislation, shouldn\u2019t those stunts constitute a crime against democracy? Gerrymandering congressional districts in extreme contortions to serve clearly partisan ends, while beyond the reach of the courts to correct according to recent Supreme Court decisions (Rucho v. Common Cause and Lamone v. Benisek), are, in my opinion, crimes against democracy.  Again these are actions that both Democratic (Maryland) and Republican (North Carolina) dominated legislatures have undertaken, but they are wrong and should be corrected. What about the abject refusal to consider the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice for a full year? Or government officials calling those who constructively criticize the government or engage in peaceful dissent as \u201cenemies\u201d? Or directing racial hate against a sitting member of the legislature? Let 16-year-olds vote This country needs to take its democratic processes more seriously.  I\u2019ve argued before that democratically elected representatives should follow a Golden Rule of Democracy: ruling as if you will not be in charge one day \u2013  adopting laws and policies that will apply to you when you are no longer in the majority.  Our political parties in the past few decades have not appeared to have considered that possibility. But such \u201ccrimes\u201d are not limited to elected officials or candidates.  We, as citizen-sovereigns and the atomic elements of a democracy, have an obligation to do our part to serve the democratic process.  That means voting and serving on juries when called.  Should we think about one\u2019s failure to do either as a kind of crime or misdemeanor against democracy? In Australia and Brazil  there are consequences for not voting.  There may be good reasons not to vote, but it does hurt our democratic system that the voter turnout in the US is lower than in other developed countries. Perhaps labeling such acts of apathy as a crime against democracy (here, no doubt a misdemeanor) is enough to point out the importance of participation, while not forcing it.  The US needs to take more seriously not just actual crimes, not just partisanship, but crimes against democracy itself.  We need to take seriously, first, civic education, so people of all ages but particularly the young, emerging voters of the future understand what citizenship is.  We need debate across socio-economic and cultural lines to work out political differences.  And we need to demand more of our elected officials, as well as ourselves, in serving the over-arching principles of representative democracy that gave rise to the United States Constitution.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. The Conspiracy Theorist-in-Chief is at it again. I\u2019m speaking, of course, about President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to retweet a baseless conspiracy theory about the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein. I\u2019m not going to repeat the tweet because it\u2019s pure nonsense.  But suffice it to say that the President is giving the imprimatur of the Oval Office to someone who suggests that Trump\u2019s past political rivals, the Clintons, could be behind Epstein\u2019s fate. Avlon: The conspiracy theorist-in-chief is at it again As normalized as he\u2019s made this kind of insanity, we must all again confront the fact that the President of the United States is fomenting hate, and division, and disinformation. This appears to be less about strategy and more about impulse. Donald Trump has promoted conspiracy theories before, most notably beginning his political career by pumping up the racist birther conspiracy theory about Barack Obama in 2011. During the 2016 campaign, he baselessly suggested that the father of his primary rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, was somehow involved in the assassination of JFK. This didn\u2019t stop Cruz from sucking up to Trump after the election. This time, however, the President\u2019s conspiracy theory comes less than two weeks after a news report revealed an FBI intelligence bulletin from the bureau\u2019s Phoenix, Arizona office (and obtained by Yahoo News) warning that \u201cconspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists\u201d should be considered as potential terrorist threats. The report, dated May 30, 2019, according to Yahoo, says that \u201csocial media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access.\u201d Tapper: Trump often uses Twitter to amplify the worst of us By that standard, the President of the United States has become one of the most powerful forces for promoting misinformation today. When the President spreads these theories, he\u2019s not just asking questions \u2013 as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway suggested last weekend \u2013 he is amplifying their message from the bully pulpit. And that leads some folks \u2013 including the unhinged or uninformed \u2013 to believe it. What\u2019s doubly shameful is that President Trump has access to the world\u2019s greatest intelligence services. But too often he is disinterested in fact-based views that push against his pre-conceived notions. For example, the New York Times reports that the President doesn\u2019t want to receive briefings on efforts to secure America\u2019s election system against further Russian attacks. This is not just a dereliction of duty, it would seem to undercut the oath of office he took to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. On Saturday, a former acting solicitor general of the United States, Neal Katyal, tweeted that it was \u201cliterally unfathomable\u201d that the President would retweet such a thing.  \u201cIt would be outrageous for even a member of the local city council.\u201d It would. But in some ways that\u2019s the point.  You wouldn\u2019t tolerate someone in your life \u2013 much less a public official at any level \u2013 who lied multiple times a day, but we all have to live with this President and his decisions. Booker: Trump spreading conspiracies is 'dangerous' Some folks might take comfort in the idea that the effects of Trump\u2019s worst impulses are often contained. As one senior national security official told my colleague Jake Tapper, \u201cEveryone at this point ignores what the President says and just does their job. The American people should take some measure of confidence in that.\u201d But that\u2019s only comforting if you adjust your expectations to a bizarro world where senior national security officials view the commander in chief like a malevolent child. Atlantic columnist David Frum puts it in stark terms: \u201cThe days of \u2018taking Trump seriously, not literally\u2019 have long since passed. By this point, Trump is taken neither seriously nor literally. His words are as worthless as Trump Organization IOUs.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing: the 40-or-so percent of Americans who support President Trump do believe him \u2013 or they choose to dismiss what he says by engaging in paroxysms of whataboutism; deflecting by denouncing socialism or \u201cthe squad\u201d or, somehow still, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Chappaqua\u2019s most famous retirees. Others seek refuge in the mantra \u201cdon\u2019t pay attention to what he says but what he does,\u201d and then quickly pivot to the economy. Scaramucci says he does not support Trump's reelection But the President\u2019s supporters cannot simply do Trump a la carte. If you endorse the President, you are endorsing what he says, as well as what he does. You\u2019re saying that this all is consistent with your vision of how presidents should behave. If that\u2019s your argument, try to imagine any other president publicly accusing a predecessor of murdering someone. I\u2019ll wait. And if you think that he may be a bully, but he\u2019s your bully, watch out. One of his most loyal supporters, Anthony Scaramucci, just got kicked to the curb for cautioning the President on dividing the country along racial lines. He failed the 100% test and was publicly attacked by Trump, just like the first Senator to endorse his campaign, Jeff Sessions, and many, many more. As Scaramucci said, \u201cEventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country.\u201d By now it should be clear that there is no bottom to this President\u2019s willingness to destroy democratic norms. He will divide to conquer. He will lie reflexively and promote conspiracy theories until it starts to seem normal. It isn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t a reality show. This is our country.",

Jones is co-author of \u201cSay it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.\u201d She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia\u2019s 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN. President Trump is a racist who encourages white supremacy \u2013 that\u2019s the battle cry for many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Beto O\u2019Rourke, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. And for many Americans, myself included, it\u2019s satisfying to finally hear out loud what we\u2019ve felt all along. But will it really matter in 2020? Politics is not black and white. And Trump is fighting back by denying he\u2019s a racist divider. Despite the rise of hate crimes and a number of mass shootings that have targeted specific groups including Latinos, black and brown communities, Jews and Muslims, it seems too simple to make Trump the poster boy for white supremacy. It\u2019s been too easy to label his supporters redneck, rural Americans. Because in focusing solely on our racial and religious divisions, we ignore the vast power and influence of big-money backers such as billionaire real estate mogul Stephen Ross, who have quietly supported Trump from the very beginning. Ross\u2019 role in the terrorizing of our democracy should not be ignored. Monied men like Ross have enabled President Trump to divide and conquer America with his toxic rhetoric, fear-mongering and biased policies. I hold them all accountable for the daily terror that so many communities feel every day. Ross, who owns the Miami Dolphins and serves as the chairman and majority owner of the Related Companies, which oversees Equinox Fitness, SoulCycle and BlinkFitness, held a Trump reelection fundraiser at his Southampton, New York, home Friday. The price of admission? Guests will pay up to $100,000 for a picture with the President, or $250,000 to listen in on a roundtable discussion. Clearly, the color green \u2013 not black or white \u2013 holds the most clout when it comes to holding court with Trump. Dolphins WR Kenny Stills says he's received death threats since criticizing team owner Stephen Ross Miami Dolphins wide receiver Kenny Stills, an outspoken figure on social justice issues, was quick to criticize his boss. Ross is also founder of a non-profit that works to \u201celiminate racial discrimination, champion social justice and improve race relations,\u201d at least according to its mission statement. Stills took to Twitter to blast Ross, tweeting, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a non profit with this mission statement then open your doors to Trump.\u201d Ross responded to critics Wednesday and defended his role in being an \u201cactive participant in the democratic process.\u201d The statement read, \u201cI have been, and will continue to be, an outspoken champion of racial equality, inclusion, diversity, public education and environmental sustainability, and I have and will continue to support leaders on both sides of the aisle to address these challenges.\u201d Stills had it right. It\u2019s hard to imagine how you can support both sides of white supremacy and racism, neither of which are political issues to be voted up or down. And yet, repeatedly we hear this sorry defense from Trump and his followers. Two Miami Dolphins kneel for National Anthem Unlike Ross, Stills has been consistent in his message of racial and social justice. For years now, Stills has taken a knee during the National Anthem before football games, joining the protests begun by former NFL player Colin Kaepernick that sparked national outcry and ugly criticism from President Trump. Stills isn\u2019t the only one feeling duped \u2013 news of Ross\u2019 support for Trump prompted a widespread call to boycott Equinox and SoulCycle. Please count me in. I want a refund. Who knew when I signed up for my first SoulCycle class years ago after hearing then-first lady Michelle Obama rave about the soulful, fun spin classes that my dollars would be associated with Trump in any way. At least I was in good company \u2013 even Oprah and Chelsea Clinton have promoted the trendy exercise class. Had Ross\u2019 support for Donald Trump been public knowledge, I would have kept my money and gone elsewhere. Shannon Coulter, who manages the protest group Grab Your Wallet, urged her followers to contact the businesses under The Related Companies and speak out. But it remains to be seen whether his companies will suffer any financial repercussions. The real reason Megan Rapinoe sets Donald Trump off I\u2019m hoping the power of social media will win out here and that Ross will lose business for his blatant, two-faced politics. Listening to the constant calls for impeachment and the claim by some Democrats who say Trump is unfit for office, one might imagine a 2020 win might be a stretch for Donald Trump. Don\u2019t be fooled. The money tells a different story. To date, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, including groups connected to the campaign, has raised $237 million, according to a Washington Post report. The President\u2019s re-election campaign is set to outpace his fundraising in 2016. And with a little help from friends like Ross, the financial forecast for Trump\u2019s 2020 run looks great. Ross, who cited his 40-year relationship with Trump on Wednesday, had high praise for Trump when he appeared on Bloomberg in 2016. While he had some hesitation about Trump as president, Ross said, \u201cHe\u2019s great. He makes people feel good about themselves. If you\u2019re spending time with Donald alone, you cannot not like Donald.\u201d I\u2019m not sure many Americans have met the feel-good Donald. No matter. For now, at least, Ross is standing by his man.  That\u2019s the problem with big-money influence in politics. It allows privileged, powerful men like Stephen Ross to be blind to the fears, hopes and dreams of everyday Americans.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In this weekly column \u201cCross-exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. Federal law defines \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d but inexplicably does not make it a crime. Because there currently is no federal law criminalizing domestic terrorism, some mass casualty attacks \u2013 including certain indiscriminate mass shootings \u2013 can fall between the cracks and leave federal agents and prosecutors without a crime to investigate and charge. Lawmakers can and should close this gaping loophole immediately to address the growing threat posed by terrorists who commit mass casualty attacks inside the United States. After Sept. 11, 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which added a technical definition of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d to federal law books: illegal acts that are \u201cdangerous to human life\u201d and intended to \u201cintimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d or influence government by \u201cintimidation or coercion\u201d or \u201cmass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\u201d But while the new law gave federal agents additional powers to investigate domestic terrorism cases, it did not make domestic terrorism a freestanding federal crime. Nearly all mass shootings and other violent attacks (including murder and attempted murder) currently can be charged under state laws, but only some can be prosecuted under federal law.  For example, federal prosecutors have vast tools to charge attacks relating to international terrorism \u2013 but those laws require some connection to a foreign country. In other words, they do not address the purely domestic actor. Federal prosecutors also can charge a federal hate crime where a defendant commits an attack motivated by \u201crace, color, religion or national origin\u201d of the intended victims. For example, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter has been charged with federal hate crimes, and the El Paso shooter could face the same charges based on evidence that he targeted Hispanic people. But the federal hate crime law does not apply to mass attacks driven by motivations other than \u201crace, color, religion or national origin.\u201d Tackle white supremacy as terrorism, experts say Similarly, federal prosecutors might be able to charge a mass attacker, depending on the methodology employed.  Federal prosecutors charged serial pipe bomber Cesar Sayoc with various offenses relating to explosives and weapons of mass destruction. But such charges do not apply in cases involving attacks committed with firearms. Current law therefore leaves federal prosecutors with no applicable charge in certain types of mass casualty events. To take an extreme example, the horrific 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, likely could not have been charged as a federal crime had the shooter survived. There was no international aspect of the attack, so federal terrorism charges would not have applied. The shooter did not appear to act out of racial or other motive covered by the hate crime law. And the shooter used a firearm but not an explosive or weapon of mass destruction. The Newtown shooter certainly could have been charged with the state crime of murder for every life taken, but the feds likely would\u2019ve been unable to charge the shooter with anything. A new statute could give federal prosecutors a hook to charge such cases. That is significant because, as formidable as many state-level law enforcement agencies are, the FBI remains the nation\u2019s premier investigative law enforcement agency.  While the FBI can assist on purely state-level investigations, the agency within the US Department of Justice is likely to dedicate more resources to a case offering the potential for federal charges. What I learned when white supremacists came after me A new statute also could result in stronger sentences. Sayoc was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his pipe bombing spree, but had there been a domestic terrorism statute in place carrying a higher mandatory-minimum sentence (of 25 years or life, for example), he would\u2019ve faced harsher and more certain punishment. President Donald Trump and other political leaders have mentioned other possible legislative changes to address mass shootings. Some bipartisan consensus appears to be forming around legislation to expand background checks. Such legislation would close a loophole allowing purchases without background checks at gun shows and over the internet, but also likely would be met with resistance from the National Rifle Association and aligned interests. Trump also has endorsed the imposition of the death penalty \u201cquickly, decisively and without years of needless delay\u201d for certain hate crimes and mass murders. But support for the death penalty is dwindling across the United States, and there is little concrete evidence that the death penalty deters violent crime. Of all the proposed legislative responses, creation of a new federal domestic terrorism statute should be a no-brainer for politicians across the ideological spectrum. There is little political downside, and plenty to gain by standing as a leading voice against staggering acts of violence. And, as homegrown mass attacks emerge as a grave and growing threat, the need for federal legislation specifically punishing domestic terrorism has become impossible to ignore. Michael, Canada: The Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization relating to hush money payments. Can state prosecutors in New York indict a sitting president? A state-level prosecutor can indict a sitting president, but the big question is whether such a charge would survive when challenged by the sitting president in court. Longstanding federal Justice Department policy counsels against indicting a sitting president, though the policy memo itself acknowledges that no court has ever ruled on the precise issue. But state prosecutors operate separately and independently from the federal Justice Department, so the policy is not binding on state attorneys general or district attorneys, who charge and enforce state law. Ex-prosecutor outlines probe's danger to Trump If a state attorney general or district attorney did indict a sitting president, the president almost certainly would move immediately to dismiss the indictment.  A sitting president likely would raise the same core argument articulated in the Justice Department memo: that such an indictment would unduly \u201cinterfere with the president\u2019s unique official duties,\u201d effectively paralyzing the executive branch. A sitting president also likely would argue that state-level charges \u2013 which can be brought by elected prosecutors of the opposite political party \u2013 are susceptible to political motivation, or at least the appearance of such. Indeed, an attorney for the Trump Organization already has called the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office subpoena a \u201cpolitical hit job.\u201d In the Trump Organization case, the Justice Department reportedly will bring no additional charges relating to a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Michael Cohen is the only person charged with a campaign finance crime relating to this payment, though the Southern District alleged that Cohen acted \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1\u201d \u2013 Trump \u2013 who, as mentioned above, cannot be charged under Justice Department policy. (Trump\u2019s lawyer responded, \u201cWe have maintained from the outset that the President never engaged in any campaign finance violation.\u201d) But according to The New York Times, the Manhattan District Attorney appears to be taking a different approach. The Trump Organization reportedly booked the $130,000 hush money payment as \u201clegal fees\u201d paid to Cohen. If so, then Trump Organization officials might have violated a New York state law that criminalizes falsification of business records. Any person at the Trump Organization who made or authorized such a false entry could face state charges \u2013 though it is an open question whether such charges ultimately would stick to the sitting president. Jeff, Colorado:  Will impeachment proceedings help House Democrats get witnesses and other evidence they need, despite roadblocks put up by the White House? Yes, the existence of impeachment proceedings will be essential to the lawsuits that House Democrats have filed, and will file, to obtain evidence over the objections of the White House and Justice Department. House Democrats have sued in federal court to obtain the grand jury materials underlying special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. Grand jury information usually is secret, but can be disclosed if \u201cpreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d House Democrats argue that there is in fact a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d because articles of impeachment \u201care under consideration as part of the [Judiciary] Committee\u2019s investigation, although no final determination has been made.\u201d Don McGahn could decide Trump's political fate Expect the Trump administration to use House Democrats\u2019 own hedging against them and to argue that mere consideration of impeachment, without something more formal, is insufficient. House Democrats, in turn, can strengthen their legal hand by passing a resolution formally opening an impeachment inquiry, or at least by declaring unequivocally that an impeachment inquiry is underway. Expect to see similar legal arguments in the House Democrats\u2019 effort to enforce their subpoenas on former White House counsel Don McGahn and other witnesses. If, for example, House Democrats can point to a formal resolution opening an impeachment inquiry, they can make a strong argument in court that McGahn\u2019s testimony is central to that inquiry. If, on the other hand, there is no formal action, but rather a series of disconnected, hedged quotes from various House members, the legal argument to compel McGahn\u2019s testimony is substantially weaker. Kristina, Wyoming: How long will it take for congressional lawsuits, filed to obtain grand jury materials and enforce subpoenas, to work their way through the courts? Even in the fastest plausible scenario, it will take several months to resolve the legal battles between Congress and the executive branch. In the lawsuit filed by House Democrats to obtain grand jury material from Mueller\u2019s investigation, for example, the parties will file written briefs in District Court (the trial-level federal court) in Washington DC in September.  At the earliest, the court will hear oral argument in October. Even if the District Court decides quickly, it will issue its ruling sometime in late October or November.  New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler recently predicted that \u201cwe will probably get court decisions by the end of October, maybe shortly thereafter.\u201d  He\u2019s likely right, but the District Court\u2019s decision won\u2019t be the end of the case. Whichever side loses automatically can \u2013 and almost certainly will \u2013 appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  Even with an expedited schedule, it will take several more months for the parties to submit briefs and conduct oral argument, and for the Court of Appeals to issue its ruling. That should take the timeline to December 2019 or beyond. And it still won\u2019t be over. Whichever side loses in the Court of Appeals can request review (called \u201ccertiorari\u201d) in the US Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court is not required to hear a case, and is very selective \u2013 typically taking fewer than 2% of all cases seeking review. If the Supreme Court does take the case, tack on many more months for written briefs, oral argument and decision.  And even if the Supreme Court declines to hear the case, it takes some time to issue a formal rejection. Bottom line: Congressional lawsuits likely won\u2019t be decided until well into 2020. 1) In the wake of FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s order to conduct nationwide threat assessments, what can law enforcement do to better identify and stop potential mass-shooting threats? 2) Will New York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill follow the recommendation of an administrative judge and fire Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner? 3) Now that a majority of House Democrats favor an impeachment inquiry, will House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Nadler take official action?",

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. Jeffrey Epstein dodged justice the first time he faced criminal charges for trafficking and molesting children, exploiting a combination of wealth, influence, vile attack-the-victim tactics and an incompetent prosecutor, then-US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and current US Department of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. This time, however, Epstein is likely cooked. He faces charges likely to keep him behind bars for the rest of his life. The famously aggressive and independent Southern District of New York (where I worked for eight-plus years) has indicted him on charges of running a sex trafficking ring in which he allegedly sexually abused dozens of girls. Neither SDNY nor a public spotlight will permit a hush-hush sweetheart deal like Epstein got in Florida. The big question is, as the SDNY takes down Epstein, who else will go with him? When he first faced sex trafficking charges in Florida in 2007, Epstein skated. His powerhouse team of attorneys somehow worked with Acosta to craft an agreement that was staggeringly unjust. Epstein faced decades behind bars but Acosta let him go with a plea to two minor state-level charges (for which he was sentenced to 13 months behind bars but served most of it on work release). The deal also inexplicably immunized Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators. In 14-plus years as a prosecutor, I\u2019ve never even heard of the concept of giving a free pass to a defendant\u2019s co-conspirators. Worse, as a federal judge ruled recently, Acosta violated the rights of Epstein\u2019s victims by entering into the sweetheart plea deal without notifying them first, as the law requires. The New York indictment was unsealed Monday and details allegations that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein ran a trafficking outfit in which he paid hundreds of dollars to girls as young as 14 to have sex with him at his homes in New York and Florida and worked with employees and associates who would lure these girls there and paid some of them to recruit others for similar abuse. CNN has reached out to Epstein\u2019s lawyer for comment. In a press release, the US Attorney\u2019s office said, \u201cEpstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a daily basis.\u201d Trump's labor secretary, Alex Acosta, should resign over handling of sex-offender case Things now look bleak for Epstein. Simply being charged by the SDNY is, in itself, a defendant\u2019s nightmare. According to Justice Department data, the conviction rate on federal charges is typically over 90%, and the conviction rate in federal human trafficking cases is even a tick higher than that. Much of the case likely will center on testimony from Epstein\u2019s victims. While Epstein\u2019s attorneys in Florida cowed Acosta in part through a vicious campaign to attack the victims, the SDNY needs to stand firm. I\u2019ve done sex trafficking cases, including a trial based largely on the testimony of victims. In my experience, victims typically have no reason to lie, and juries can and will believe victims, particularly if their voices are supported by other evidence. Knowing the SDNY, they\u2019ve likely got other corroborating evidence \u2013 perhaps phone records, financial documents, e-mails or texts or travel records \u2013 to back up the victims. Epstein has three choices now. First, he can go to trial; the vast majority of defendants who go to trial in federal court get convicted, which almost certainly would send the 66 year-old Epstein to jail for the rest of his life. And a trial will certainly cause what prosecutors call \u201ccollateral damage\u201d: other wrongdoers \u2013 Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators and enablers in the alleged sex trafficking ring \u2013 will be named publicly, and the proof of their conduct will come out. Reporter describes interviews with Epstein's accusers Second, Epstein can plead guilty without cooperation. But it seems unlikely that the SDNY will give Epstein anything remotely approaching the absurdly soft deal he got in Florida.  Given the severity of the charges, I\u2019d be surprised if SDNY prosecutors let Epstein plead to anything less than a decade behind bars, without his cooperation. Third, Epstein can cooperate. This is Epstein\u2019s best chance to reduce his sentence significantly. In the SDNY, however, cooperation is all-or-nothing: a cooperator must tell prosecutors everything he knows about his own conduct and the conduct of others, including on the charged crimes and everything else. When I was with SDNY, I had cooperators originally charged with drug offenses who ended up providing information about murders. Cooperators cannot pick and choose and cannot provide information selectively. That\u2019s simply how it works in the SDNY. (Just ask Michael Cohen, who received a blistering sentencing letter from the SDNY because he was willing to answer some, but not all, of their questions). So if Epstein does cooperate, he will have to name names. It remains to be seen whether the SDNY even wants to cooperate with Epstein, given his grotesque conduct. We do not know if Epstein will cooperate, but even if he does not, others will very likely be implicated. It seems clear from the indictment that others helped Epstein run his alleged sex trafficking operation and otherwise participated in it. At least some of those names will come out in court proceedings, public filings, potentially trial and perhaps additional indictments. And it\u2019s worth noting that the Epstein case is being handled by the SDNY\u2019s Public Corruption Unit \u2013 in my experience, human trafficking cases usually are handled elsewhere in the office \u2013 which strongly suggests that public officials could be under a microscope here.  Anybody who helped Epstein in any way needs to get a lawyer and get scared. Glen, Minnesota:  I\u2019ve always heard of the checks and balances in our government. What checks are there, if any, on a Supreme Court decision? There are Constitutional checks on the Supreme Court itself, but not on its decisions. Systemically, the Constitution gives the Executive Branch (through the President) the power to nominate justices to the Supreme Court, while the Legislative Branch (Congress) can confirm or reject those nominations. The Legislative Branch also holds constitutional power to impeach Supreme Court justices. But there is essentially no check on the decisions reached by the Supreme Court. There is no higher court and no way parties can appeal to some other court. At times, the Supreme Court leaves the door open to future revision of its own decisions, pending further developments. We saw this recently when the Court ruled against inclusion of a citizenship question on the census, but gave the Trump administration a chance to come back and attempt to show a legitimate legal basis to include it. That involves the Supreme Court leaving its own door open, not some other body of government imposing its will on the Court. The real problem of Trump's citizenship question Ultimately, what the Court says, goes \u2013 whether the President or Congress like it or not. An executive order, which Trump has contemplated on the census issue, simply does not override a Supreme Court decision under our Constitutional structure. The only way a Supreme Court decision can be overridden is with a constitutional amendment (the most notable example being the 14th Amendment, which in 1868 overturned the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision by granting citizenship to all those born in the US, regardless of color). The Supreme Court also can overrule its own prior decisions, as it did in 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education overturned the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case which had upheld racial segregation under the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine. Supreme Court reversals of its own precedent are rare, and often take many years, as judicial and social norms evolve. As former Justice Robert Jackson famously noted of the Supreme Court, \u201cWe are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.\u201d Mamood, Canada:  How does the justice system handle situations where a witness given immunity protects a defendant by confessing to a crime? It sounds like a twist from a Hollywood courtroom thriller, but this happened recently in the controversial military prosecution of  former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher for murder. The prosecution called to the stand a medic who testified under a grant of immunity \u2013 meaning that the medic\u2019s own trial testimony cannot be used to prosecute him in the future \u2013 that he saw Gallagher stab the victim. But the medic then testified unexpectedly, and contrary to his own prior statements, that he, not Gallagher, killed the victim by suffocating him during medical treatment. The jury acquitted Gallagher on the murder charge and all others except one relatively minor offense for which he was sentenced to no additional jail time. The prosecutor now has a few options available. First, if the prosecutor can prove that the medic lied on the stand, then he can charge the medic with perjury (indeed, Gallagher\u2019s prosecutors are considering a perjury charge against the medic). Immunity does not cover perjury; it essentially means \u201cwe will not prosecute you based on your own trial testimony, unless you lie.\u201d And if the prosecutor can prove that Gallagher, or any other person, encouraged the witness to lie, then that person can be charged with witness tampering. The medic also can theoretically be charged with murder, but that charge cannot be based on the medic\u2019s own trial testimony, under the grant of immunity. If, however, the prosecutor can find other evidence of the medic\u2019s guilt \u2013 for example, if somebody had taken a cellphone video showing the medic actually suffocating the victim \u2013 then the medic can be charged with murder. But the prosecutor cannot use the medic\u2019s immunized trial testimony against him to prove that charge. Dan, New Mexico: How can the Supreme Court justify its decision to permit gerrymandering even if the stated purpose is for one party to gain a more favorable election outcome? The Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 vote along ideological lines \u2013 conservatives John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in the majority and liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissenting \u2013 that the federal courts have no role in reviewing \u201cgerrymandering\u201d (the process of drawing political districting maps, often for political advantage). The Court deemed gerrymandering a \u201cpolitical question\u201d best left to elected lawmakers and \u201cbeyond the reach of the federal courts.\u201d In non-legal terms, the Supreme Court ducked. The Court found that the specific districting maps before it (from Maryland and North Carolina) were \u201chighly partisan, by any measure\u201d and \u201cblatant examples of partisanship driving districting decisions.\u201d Yet the Court concluded that gerrymandering is up to elected policymakers, and that there is no reliable way for federal courts to determine precisely how partisan is too partisan. The dissent takes heated issue with the majority, calling the decision \u201ctragically wrong\u201d because extreme partisan gerrymandering poses a threat to fundamental constitutional rights \u201cto participate equally in the political process.\u201d The dissent also notes that federal courts have monitored partisan gerrymandering for many years and that \u201c[f]or the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities.\u201d As the Supreme Court notes, its decision does not necessarily open the door to unchecked partisan gerrymandering, because state legislatures, Congress and state courts can exercise oversight. But the federal courts \u2013 which are well-positioned to limit extreme gerrymandering because they stand above and apart from local or state politics \u2013 are now out of that business. 1. Who else will be implicated in Epstein\u2019s alleged sex trafficking ring? 2. Will Trump issue an executive order purporting to override the Supreme Court on the census issue, and will the Administration take other steps to continue its legal fight to include the citizenship question?  3. Will Congress finally go to court to enforce the subpoenas that Don McGahn and others thus far have defied?",

She is also the editor at large of Shareblue Media and co-host of the SiriusXM radio show Signal Boost. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinions on CNN. Like many watching the 2020 presidential race this closely this early, I don\u2019t have a favorite yet. My goal this primary season is to help make sure that the women running for President are taken as seriously as the men. So Elizabeth Warren\u2019s recent rise in polls is exciting, mostly because of what it can mean about the electorate. Indeed, the phrase I hear most often from my fellow progressives, in conjunction with the giant, sprawling, year-long search for a Democratic nominee to take on Trump in 2020, is this: \u201cI am surprised by how much I love Elizabeth Warren.\u201d After 2016, it was easy \u2013 and not just for progressives \u2013 to be depressed about our nation\u2019s ability to pick a strong leader. Hillary Clinton was the far more capable of the two major candidates on Election Day, and she still lost. She had laid out the most progressive policy agenda ever outlined by a Democratic nominee \u2013 and still she was regularly and unfairly excoriated (even by Democrats) for not speaking to the issues important to working people. It was tough to picture voters believing in another smart woman with big ideas. And as expected, when Elizabeth Warren began running, her obvious intellect was reported as a liability \u2013 it could make her unrelatable, school-marmish, the dreaded unlikable. We watched, meanwhile, as the same cheerful nerdiness was lauded in Pete Buttigieg \u2013 no one suggested learning Norwegian in college to read an author who hadn\u2019t been published in English would make him less palatable to the Rust Belt middle class. But with one bold policy proposal after another \u2013 from the Ultra-Millionaire tax to affordable universal child care (including a calculator function it seemed like no one on social media could escape), Warren is winning people over (despite \u2013 until very recently \u2013 consistently receiving less coverage). She is doing this by painting a picture of a post-Trump America that actually addresses the issues that got us Donald Trump in the first place. Call Doc Brown! Someone needs to bring Joe Biden back...to the future The Democratic party is engaged in a debate that loosely pits socialism against capitalism: Warren falls under the capitalist banner. But her approach there is both canny and grounded. By focusing on the financial pressures of motherhood that keep women from earning up to their potential, for example, she\u2019s recognizing that American capitalism is dependent on women performing the unpaid labor of child bearing and rearing. And by proposing policies squarely aimed at reducing the racial wealth gap, she\u2019s demonstrating an understanding that our capitalist economy was built on the exploitation of black labor and generations of discrimination against black and brown Americans. So, when Warren talks about reordering the economy to benefit the workers, she\u2019s talking about making it work for people whose challenges it has never truly considered. That resonates with the women who leave millions on the table because their time and labor is required to raise the next generation. It resonates with black people who work even harder than their white peers but can\u2019t crawl out of debt and build their net worth without the generational wealth that\u2019s been stolen through centuries of slavery and discrimination. Trump's 2020 campaign kickoff message: It's about you It resonates with young people who know that student debt and the rise of the low-pay, no-security gig economy means they won\u2019t be financially solvent for at least a decade, maybe more. Now it seems the biggest hurdle Warren faces is literally in the minds of Democratic voters \u2013 it is \u201cperceived electability.\u201d Democratic voters overwhelmingly rate beating Trump as extremely important in 2020, and are more likely to choose a candidate they believe can do it. As of today, the week before the first debate, Elizabeth Warren is capturing the heart of the Democratic party.  A pair of recent polls show Warren\u2019s rise is the newest trend to shake up the Democratic pack. But those who have warmed to her still don\u2019t seem to believe their neighbors will warm to her enough to vote for her, too. The problem with this thinking is that we are notoriously bad at predicting this far out who we\u2019re going to elect. There was so much love for Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t until largely white Iowa voters declared en masse that they would in fact vote for him that many Democrats (including prominent black Americans) felt comfortable being open in their support. Once they perceived that Obama was electable, they did the work of getting him elected.  Elizabeth Warren spent the first six months of her candidacy issuing bold policy declarations, making calls to individual voters, sharing her compelling hardscrabble personal story, and electrifying crowds by having a plan. She\u2019s convinced a healthy amount of the electorate that she\u2019s the person they want to see sworn in when this is all over. If those people start to believe that the support she enjoys is a strength \u2013 and could mean she\u2019s their best chance to win the whole thing, then we might have a new Democratic frontrunner.",

Follow her on Twitter @ashtonlattimore. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Awareness of the United States\u2019 abysmal statistics on black maternal mortality has been growing \u2013 in large part thanks to Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 focus on the issue. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren rolled out a plan to offer \u201cbonus\u201d funds to hospitals that reduce their rates of maternal mortality among black women \u2013 and to penalize those that don\u2019t confront the problem. And, earlier this month, Sen. Kamala Harris led the charge to introduce a Senate resolution designating April 11-17 as Black Maternal Health Week, and 50 House Democrats joined to form the Black Maternal Health Caucus. All the attention to the problem is necessary and justified, but as a black woman who\u2019s five months along in my pregnancy, it brings unwelcome reminders of the risks to me and my baby. That\u2019s a dark thought to intrude upon an otherwise joyful time, but whenever I read the news or scroll through Twitter, it\u2019s inescapable. Being pregnant already brings with it a familiar array of anxieties and discomforts, but knowledge of the dismal state of maternal health for women like me is yet one more burden I must bear. So, how does this manifest on a day-to-day basis? At the same time I\u2019m trying to remember which kinds of fish contain too much mercury, I\u2019m also wondering if I need to memorize the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism in case I need to advocate for myself \u2013 the way Serena Williams did, as she suffered the life-threatening postpartum complication. While I\u2019m searching Amazon for the best prenatal workout videos to accommodate my growing bump, I\u2019m also spending hours trying to research which obstetricians and hospitals have better outcomes for black women to figure out where I should deliver. Since this kind of data is difficult to find, and hospitals can decline to respond to surveys on the issue, I\u2019ve instead found myself sifting through anecdotal stories from local mothers in Facebook groups and on pregnancy forums. And, as I\u2019m mulling over whether my husband and I need to shell out for a double stroller with a 2-year-old and an infant on the way, I\u2019m also planning for the considerable expense of hiring a doula who can help facilitate a smoother birth. My fears aren\u2019t abstract. I\u2019m an only child because my own mother nearly died from complications arising from my birth, and the statistics haven\u2019t improved much since then. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the maternal mortality rate is worse today than it was 25 years ago, and, according to the Centers for Disease Control, black women are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes \u2013 including infections after birth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (high blood pressure), and severe postpartum bleeding. Studies show that health care providers are as infected with racial bias as any other cohort in American society, routinely underestimating and undertreating black patients\u2019 pain and failing to take our symptoms seriously. And though I\u2019m fortunate to have health insurance and access to high-quality medical facilities when far too many black women do not, the risks to black mothers and babies persist across income and education levels. Given those realities, to be black and pregnant at this moment is to feel caught uncomfortably in an in-between space \u2013 after society has recognized the breadth of the problem, but before large-scale reforms to address it are implemented. The expectation that black women will resort to self-help when systemic change is slow in coming is a familiar one for those of us in marginalized groups: While the gender pay gap persists, women are told to lean in and learn to negotiate to make up the difference; as racial gaps in education continue to defy large-scale efforts toward improvement, black children are taught they need to be \u201ctwice as good\u201d to get ahead in the world. Serena Williams: What my life-threatening experience taught me about giving birth On the issue of black maternal health, groups like the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an advocacy and research organization focused on black maternal health, rights and justice, have stepped up not only to call for large-scale policy reforms, but also to do work with a more immediate impact, such as offering trainings for clinicians, midwives, doulas and other maternal care service providers on how to provide respectful, holistic care to black mothers. I\u2019ve also tried to help other black women in my own small way. As one of the first of my friends to have a baby, during and after my first pregnancy I wrote and shared with them an informal guide on everything from managing pregnancy symptoms and birth preparation tips, to perspectives on engaging a doula and postpartum self-care. The animating force behind my work was the knowledge that until necessary systemic reforms are put into place, black women have to fend for ourselves \u2013 and for each other. But I shouldn\u2019t have to do all that just to give my friends and our babies the chance to survive and thrive in the world. At such a vulnerable, exhausting and hopefully joyful time in our lives \u2013 one when we\u2019re constantly admonished to avoid stress \u2013 black mothers should be able to trust that we can lean on others, especially medical providers, to assist in our care.  So, while it\u2019s heartening to see politicians and others beginning to recognize the significance and urgency of black maternal health issues, it\u2019s imperative that the solutions we look toward include long-term systemic fixes, but also shorter-term stopgap measures that can help black women whose pregnancies will have begun and ended before the next presidential election comes around. That might mean funding grants to allow more women to afford better prenatal care and hiring doulas to help them navigate the system \u2013 or providing increased data and transparency on which care providers and institutions are safest for black women right now. With those kinds of immediate reforms, policymakers could begin to lighten some of the mental and logistical burden on black mothers-to-be who are carrying so much already.",

View more opinion on CNN. Twenty-seven years ago, on the night of April 29, 1992, my life changed forever. Before that night, I was working the late shift at a home for people with major mental illness. That\u2019s where I was when I turned on the TV to watch Dennis Miller\u2019s show. Yeah, that Dennis Miller. Yeah, he had a liberal talk show back then. I liked it. The rest of the night changed my life for good, propelling me into political life. Miller\u2019s\u2019 face was visibly ashen, even on the cheap screen, and he didn\u2019t tell jokes. He was shocked. Los Angeles was in violent civil uprisings after a jury had acquitted Sgt. Stacey Koon and officers Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell and Timothy Wind of using excessive force against Rodney King. My own face went ashen, in turn. Along with much of America, I had seen the video of those officers beating King. As a white woman, it had not occurred to me then that anyone would conclude that the beating was OK. I immediately switched channels to CNN and watched their coverage of the uprisings all night, weeping. The video of officers beating King was among the first of its kind to go national. Its violence was shocking to a lot of white people. For the first time, we saw on our TV screens what people of color had known and been telling us for decades and we had had the privilege not to believe: that police officers could beat and harass and damage people of color with impunity. When citizens film police: Does anything change? In the events of that late April, I saw that white people had not only been the police officers but also most of the jury. I saw that white people had made a decision, again, that dehumanized black people. I saw that this decision implicated all white people, that racism was a white people problem. It was about us, and it was up to us to do our part to end it. That night I made a decision that has shaped everything I have done since: I dedicated myself to learning more about racism and learning how to take action against it. I listened to and learned from people of color what true support looks like (hint: they do not need white people to save them). What I have learned in the intervening years has also helped me make better sense of what happened on April 29, 1992. It has also helped me understand the 2016 election and what we white people are facing in 2020. After that night, I chose to pursue sociology instead of psychology. I began to participate in local politics rather than study it. I chose to run for city council and eventually mayor. Those choices continue to propel my work as a writer, speaker, adviser and consultant. One of the things I learned really hit home as I governed in Minneapolis as council member and mayor and it hits home now as we stare down the barrel of the Trump presidency: Race is an ever-changing category that those in power have adapted to their own ends over time, as needed to protect government and economic systems. Why the 1992 L.A. riots matter today Supreme Court cases in the last century made it clear that in America, what we mean when we use the word \u201crace\u201d has always been a moving target. Being \u201cwhite\u201d has had the highest rewards and yet the most precarious boundaries \u2013 people of Irish and Italian descent were included in whiteness only 150 years ago. Before that, they were denied jobs and housing because of their \u201crace.\u201d That\u2019s what America\u2019s predominant approach to race does \u2013 it allocates resources and makes us think it is personal rather than systematic. Especially on the far side of the civil rights movement, white people often think racism is about individual people acting out of racial bias \u2013 so if they don\u2019t feel racial bias, they feel absolved of any responsibility for racism. That belief neatly occludes a history of governance and policy-making designed to get better outcomes for whites. See, for example, redlining and its legacy or school segregation and funding and its legacy. Those of us who are white are taught not to acknowledge race and how it works in our systems. Scholar Robin DiAngelo, who coined the term \u201cwhite fragility,\u201d has laid out the case that white people are in denial of whiteness itself \u2013 and the privileges that go along with it. DiAngelo characterizes this as a failure of racial literacy, a failure to properly understand how race functions in American society. Why Virginia's chaos has deep roots As long as we are peering through the lens of whiteness our future will look like our present \u2013 which looks frighteningly like our past. That has grave implications for those of us who would like to see a new President in January, 2021. The media, political operatives, and political analysts have focused ongoing attention and discussion on a narrow band of white 2016 voters in the Midwest/Rust Belt who are credited with giving Trump the electoral college victory. It\u2019s not wrong to focus on working-class white voters and their economic problems; their problems are shared by lots of Americans. The problem is that, as a result, the attention also prioritizes their chosen solutions to the problems, solutions that included support for Donald Trump\u2019s policies targeting of immigrants of color, magnifying racial resentment, and reasserting whiteness as the natural and preferred default \u201cgood\u201d in American life. Charlottesville wasn't about Robert E. Lee, Mr. President. It was about racism What if instead of treating a small group of white voters as the most important, we focused on the people who did not vote at all in 2016? Voters who were underrepresented in the 2016 election have been voting in higher numbers in every subsequent election, often making the difference in special elections and the midterms. What if we focused on the voters whose voices have been animating progressive politics for decades? Women of color, especially black women. Young people. Doug Jones knows they matter, for example. The newly blue Orange County knows. What if, instead of deciding to acquiesce to the underlying racism of some white voters because some say it\u2019s the only way to win, Democrats appealed to the hope and community-based policies of younger voters and voters of color? What if white journalists, editors, and commentators acquired new ways to examine the electorate and our country? We would come to understand that racial equity is not charity \u2013 and that to aspire to be \u201ccolor blind\u201d is an insult to the history of people of color and indigenous people in this country. The invitation and responsibility facing white people now is to see our own whiteness, to release the false sense of security it gives us and reconnect with our underlying humanity.  What I have learned in the last 27 years, a gift of the decision I made that night in 1992, is that if we decenter whiteness and recenter true connection and community, our entire country will be stronger and better for everyone \u2013 including white people. We have a chance to do just that as we decide who to support for president in 2020.",

His book, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Religious Left: Politics, Television, and Popular Culture in the 1970s and Beyond,\u201d will be published in the fall of 2019 by Columbia University Press. The views expressed here are his. View more opinion on CNN. Since the 2016 presidential election, images, memes and stories involving the infamous television character Archie Bunker, the notoriously blunt, occasionally racist patriarch of Norman Lear\u2019s iconic 1970s show \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d have been circulating on the internet and across social media. For many, his reappearance indicates a sad state of affairs when it comes to American politics. To them, Bunker famously embodied the same brand of resentment, anger and misunderstanding that seems to saturate the populace at the expense of rational, sustained dialogue. To others, Archie\u2019s image functions as a rallying cry of sorts, one that gave frustrated working-class whites a symbol to identify with and support during the 1970s. The seventies were a difficult time economically for the nation \u2013 Archie included. His foreman jobs were drying up while others seemed to be stepping ahead of him in the proverbial line. But while Bunker, portrayed by Carroll O\u2019Connor, has become a more familiar sight on Facebook these past few years, the initial conservative reaction to and appropriation of Bunker on behalf of a \u201csilent majority\u201d remains largely forgotten in the annals of television history. \u201cArchie for President\u201d bumper stickers, T-Shirts, and buttons were made following the show\u2019s premiere on behalf of a fictional character who spoke to the anxieties of countless working- and middle-class families across the country \u2013 anxieties more recently embodied in the figure of a real-life President, Donald J. Trump. Jimmy Kimmel's 'All in the Family' and 'Jeffersons' special will air in May \u201cAll in the Family\u201d both confronted and contributed to our polarized moment by placing a bigot in front of America in the name of satire. Many laughed at Archie, the show\u2019s larger didactic aspiration. But many also laughed with him. This historical tension demands greater attention in our own moment, especially when we see its echoes playing out in contemporary politics. These resonances between then and now are apparently evident to the show\u2019s creator as well. On a recent episode of his late night television show, host Jimmy Kimmel announced that he and \u201cAll in the Family\u201d creator Norman Lear would be working together in producing a live television special that would reimagine episodes of both \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and \u201cThe Jeffersons,\u201d the latter being one of Lear\u2019s more successful spin-offs (All in the Family had a total of five). A star-studded lineup awaits the show\u2019s viewers including Will Ferrell, Jamie Foxx, and Wanda Sykes. Nixon no fan of Archie Bunker For the special\u2019s producers, including Lear, the production is less about the show itself, and more about the fact that socially relevant programming can still be made today \u2013 even on network television. \u201cThey have said over and over again that these two shows were meant for the \u201970s and would not work today,\u201d Lear observed. \u201cWe disagree with them and are here to prove, with two great casts depicting \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and \u201cThe Jeffersons,\u201d the timelessness of human nature.\u201d As of late, such programming has largely migrated to premium channels and streaming services, but back when \u201cAll in the Family\u201d reigned supreme, sitcoms including the likes of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d made contemporaneous events part of their weekly plots. As such, both the women\u2019s movement and anti-Vietnam movement received free publicity packaged as political critique in prime time. Norman Lear recalls network clash over 'Maude' abortion episode In short, the two shows\u2019 reappearance on network television speaks to the value that Lear himself finds in situational comedy, and the various contributions he\u2019s made to American television history. In fact, he takes great pride in his ability to speak to, and program in, the drama that is the human condition. For literary critic Geoffrey Wolfe, \u201cIt was just this power to shift from tears to laughter, and mean it, that tapped into that huge, unprecedented audience.\u201d In essence, if you weren\u2019t crying or laughing, than you weren\u2019t truly living. Unlike those who identified with Bunker, Lear and company have brought the show back, Bunker and all (played by actor Woody Harrelson), to remind us that television does not simply have to be a series of flashing colors and complex circuitry. Television can also have a didactic purpose \u2013 one that seeks to educate as much as it wants to entertain. For Lear, it has always been the duty of television to not only make people laugh, but also to report on the times in which it finds itself. The question for us to consider collectively is whether we are ready to acknowledge the complex racial legacy of \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d and the role that such a legacy continues to play in our contemporary politics. Lear: 'All in the Family' could not air today In other words, Archie\u2019s reappearance in public life is noteworthy because it is troubling. Lear did not place a bigot in front of American audiences because he agreed with Archie\u2019s claims; he did so because Archie\u2019s views were not meant to endure in the public eye. In fact, many at the time, including actor Carroll O\u2019Connor, thought they were ultimately destined for the dustbin of history. \u201cThe lesson is \u2013 if you think this way, change,\u201d O\u2019Connor admitted in an interview in Ebony Magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson. But we don\u2019t come out and say so, because that is a very bad way to teach.\u201d By bringing attention to bigotry, Lear hoped to combat its nefarious character in an age of culture war, but the results of his intentions have been less than clear. While the show may have helped confront disagreement and polarization at the time, and it most certainly did, it also contributed to them at the same time by relying on satire to deliver a message of understanding and racial tolerance. As a powerful tool of social commentary, satire only works if its audiences understand it as such. Otherwise, satire can often cultivate the very thing it seeks to examine critically, such as bigotry and racism.  It will be quite revealing to see how Archie is portrayed in this live iteration of the show in 2019. Will Archie be as coarse and honest as he once was? Which episodes will be chosen? What will be their respective plots? Will we come to see Archie in a different light? And will contemporary standards and practices allow such programming and content to grace their airwaves in the age of the alt-right? I sure hope so, because if so, we could finally have a conversation about what continues to divide us, and why, in an age of intensified division and polarization. The networks once did \u2013 we\u2019ll see if they\u2019re willing to do so once more.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Marianne Schnall is the author of \u201cWhat Will It Take to Make a Woman President? Conversations About Women, Leadership and Power\u201d and the founder of Feminist.com and the What Will It Take movement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. A record six women are running for president on the Democratic side: Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson. This unprecedented number, along with the historic surge of women who ran and were elected to office in the 2018 midterms, is a hopeful indication that women are beginning to make headway on the long and difficult path toward parity in politics. But when it comes to fundraising \u2013 which, like it or not, is often synonymous with a candidate\u2019s viability in our current political system \u2013 female candidates have historically struggled to raise as much money as men. While the 2018 midterms showed us that the tide may be beginning to turn in terms of women\u2019s fundraising efforts, we must be aware of the challenges women still face when raising money \u2013 and what we can do to make the presidential playing field as even as possible. When comparing some of the first-day fundraising totals of the 2020 candidates who disclosed their numbers, the male candidates came out far ahead of the female candidates. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke made headlines as he brought in the largest first-day haul out of any 2020 Democratic candidate so far. Raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours from donors in all 50 states, O\u2019Rourke bested Sen. Bernie Sanders for the title of having the most first-day donations. It's Kamala Harris' race right now Yet the female presidential candidates\u2019 first-day numbers were significantly lower, with Harris raising $1.5 million and Klobuchar raising $1 million. While there is an apparent fundraising gap in the first-day totals, things look a little more gender balanced when examining the top two first-quarter fundraising totals for the Democratic presidential primary candidates. Though Sanders is at the front of the pack with $18.2 million, Harris rose into second position with an impressive $12 million. As I explored what stands in the way of more women entering politics in my book, \u201cWhat Will It Take to Make a Woman President?\u201d I found that men and women alike identified fundraising as one of the most significant contributors to the lack of women in political office. Strong Democratic women are Trump's kryptonite Whether because of cultural biases against women in leadership positions, female candidates viewing the prospect of fundraising as a significant hurdle to running, women feeling uneasy asking for money or general incumbency challenges, women have been at a disadvantage on the fundraising front. As renowned feminist activist Gloria Steinem reflected during our conversation on her own experience fundraising for female candidates, historically women have struggled to raise funds: \u201cMoney is a huge barrier. I\u2019ve raised money for candidates who, if I\u2019m raising money for them, probably are all the same on the issues. But if I\u2019m raising money for a man running for the Senate, someone will give me $1,000; if it\u2019s a woman, they\u2019ll give me $200 or $300. Not consciously, but unconsciously.\u201d There is reason to be hopeful. A recent report by the Center for Responsive Politics concluded that, at least for House Democrats, women raised more money than men overall by the end of the 2018 midterm cycle. But, the report cautioned, black women still faced clear disadvantages in fundraising, particularly from large individual donors. That said, the fact that Harris has raised $12 million so far may be a sign that gender and racial biases are beginning to shift. We are seeing further evidence of this positive trend of increased political interest and support for female candidates of color (and their growing influence as organizers and voters) play out in races across the country and in countless milestones achieved. Just look at the historic wins for women of color in the midterms election and the recent election of Chicago\u2019s first black female mayor. What woman presidential candidates are facing We\u2019ve also seen what can happen when women\u2019s collective power and potential are tapped. In Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 bid for president, she raised $47.5 million during her first 2\u00bd months as a presidential candidate, and of the more than 250,000 contributors who donated to her campaign, 61% were women. Although Clinton is an extraordinary example and her numbers may be an exception, her campaign showed us that contributions from female supporters can make a big difference. But there are also the more recent notable examples of females, such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who won their 2018 primaries even though they raised far less than their opponents. Ocasio-Cortez raised $300,000, while her opponent, Joseph Crowley, raised $3.4 million, and Pressley was at nearly a 2-to-1 fundraising disadvantage against Michael Capuano. These remarkable wins suggest that money may also be losing some of its influence in politics. That said, if we want to maintain the momentum behind fundraising efforts for female candidates, there are concrete steps we can take. Be aware. Let\u2019s be careful not to assume that women don\u2019t still face inequities and unique challenges when running for elected office. We need to be aware of \u2013 and raise awareness about \u2013 the cultural and structural obstacles, including sexism, biased media coverage and a lack of access to adequate funding, that still put female leaders at a disadvantage. Contribute to campaigns. Voters must step in not only to help with campaigns but also to make financial donations to female candidates they believe in. Women voters already seem to be increasing their political engagement and giving, as evidenced in the 2018 election cycle. Though men still made up the vast majority of donors, there were significant increases in women\u2019s contributions: 34% of congressional campaign contributions to all candidates came from women, and 45% of campaign contributions for Democratic female candidates came from women.  Push for campaign finance reform. Changing the value structure in political campaigns is critical to opening up opportunities for more women to run and win. A long-term solution is campaign finance reform \u2013 a movement to reduce the involvement of money in politics and restrict the amount of money that individuals and interest groups can contribute to political campaigns \u2013 which would help to ensure that we do not determine candidates\u2019 worth or potential primary success based on their fundraising numbers alone. As Rep. Barbara Lee told me, \u201cThis environment of money and politics is obscene. We have to get the public financing of campaigns to level the playing field. \u2026 It\u2019s been a man\u2019s world and so they have the access to the resources, in many ways, much more than women. So, we\u2019ve got to have a campaign finance system that really allows for equality.\u201d We all have vital roles to play in creating equality in political races. And we can do this by advocating to reduce the influence of money in politics, encouraging more women to run for office (if not making the leap into politics ourselves) and supporting women candidates we believe in.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua A. Geltzer, formerly senior director for counterterrorism and deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council, is executive director and visiting professor of law at Georgetown Law Center\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and an Arizona State University Future of War Fellow at New America. Dipayan Ghosh, formerly US privacy and public policy adviser at Facebook and former technology and economic policy adviser in the Obama White House, is the Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own; view more opinion at CNN. Last week, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development took Facebook and the broader internet industry by surprise and storm with a remarkable allegation: that the company has engaged in discriminatory practices that engendered and perpetuated bias against marginalized classes of the American population \u2013 such as non-Christians, immigrants, and minorities \u2013 by displaying housing ads only to selected audience segments in unfair ways. This charge of housing discrimination might seem like something of a peripheral matter, given core concerns about social media that relate to interference with democracy, terrorist radicalization and social polarization. But HUD\u2019s charge takes direct aim at Facebook\u2019s fundamental business model: the company\u2019s digital advertising management platform and the algorithms underlying it, which collectively enable commercial entities to splice and select the demographic audience segments they wish to target with ads based on race, gender and politics, among other factors. That makes HUD\u2019s lawsuit an important step at reining in online practices that can otherwise betray decades of important legal and regulatory progress in defending civil rights. Snapchat ramps up advertising and vows to be better at privacy than Facebook HUD\u2019s suit is the US government\u2019s most potent legal and ultimately economic statement so far against the principal business model of the consumer internet \u2013 a business model that has enabled leading internet companies to become among the most profitable, wealthy and powerful corporations in the world. That business model relies on the uninhibited collection of personal information on each and every individual user of the platforms operated by these firms, including YouTube, Google Search, Amazon\u2019s shopping service, and Facebook services such as the News Feed, Messenger and Instagram. The business model also relies on algorithms to develop behavioral profiles on individual users, to curate content in each user\u2019s social feed, and \u2013 most crucially for turning huge profits \u2013 to target digital ads at each user most likely to appeal to that particular user. It\u2019s this fundamental commercial regime that HUD has put squarely in the crosshairs with its suit. And, if these allegations yield reforms at Facebook that go above and beyond what Facebook recently accepted in order to settle a somewhat similar suit that had been filed against it by several advocacy organizations, commercial operators may no longer be able to use platforms like Facebook to engage in the type of micro-targeting that has yielded such great profits for the tech industry. That\u2019s a good thing given that online micro-targeting as practiced till now has, in essence, facilitated an end run around legislation and regulation protecting civil rights by barring discrimination in areas like housing. Most critically, the government\u2019s suit, especially on the heels of the company\u2019s recent settlement, could prove a key push down a slippery regulatory slope for Facebook \u2013 and the rest of the consumer internet and digital advertising industry. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook won't delay livestreams after New Zealand massacre HUD\u2019s allegation that Facebook enabled discrimination through its digital advertising platform by allowing the targeting of racial groups, gender groups, religious groups and others means that, at a minimum, the company will have to become far more careful about how it designs and operates its advertising platform going forward. Vulnerable groups can be targeted not only through the clear and immediate designations made by advertisers, data brokers and ad platform companies like Facebook, but also by proxy; one can, for instance, conclude with fairly high probability that residents of a certain region might be of a certain race or religion and, similarly, that individuals with preferences in certain forms of media and entertainment are likely of a certain gender. So, as Facebook continues to operate and refine its advertising platform, the company will need to consider whether it\u2019s directly or indirectly allowing advertisers to do what laws like the Fair Housing Act were introduced to stop them from doing. That\u2019s a far cry from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s onetime mantra of \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d \u2013 a departure that\u2019s all for the best, given how much seems broken already in our digital age. Furthermore, it\u2019s likely that other companies will also have to factor the HUD\u2019s lawsuit into future product design. Given ongoing HUD inquiries into advertising practices at Google and Twitter, it is quite possible that the Trump administration will bring enforcement actions against other firms across the digital advertising sector. And the pressure to change the fundamentals of how these platforms operate could go far beyond the use of data for ad targeting that\u2019s the subject of HUD\u2019s allegations. Twitter responded to the inquiry and told CNN Business it doesn\u2019t allow discriminatory advertising on its platform, while Google said it prohibits ads based on \u201csensitive\u201d categories including race, ethnicity, religion and disability. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg calls for more regulation of the internet Ever since the revelations that Russian disinformation operators leveraged platforms like Facebook and Twitter to mislead American voters throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, the pressure has been mounting, and with the 2020 presidential campaign in full swing the industry\u2019s patchwork of post-2016 reforms may begin to look insufficient. Facebook disabled the capacity for advertisers to pipe information from data brokers into Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting platform, in an apparent response to criticisms of how that capacity can be abused. But there were still notable attempts at election interference in the 2018 midterm elections, with Russian tactics shifting in emphasis away from social media accounts with massive followings and toward greater numbers of accounts, each with smaller followings. All told, HUD\u2019s allegations amount to an overdue direct challenge to a core aspect of the tech industry\u2019s business model. There\u2019s good reason for that challenge: By facilitating the spread of disinformation, exhortations to violence and more, that business model has seemed on a collision course with the flourishing of our democracy and even our national security.  It\u2019s telling that, just two days after HUD filed its suit, Zuckerberg penned a rare op-ed in The Washington Post, inviting government regulation. Zuckerberg called for clearer guidance from government about harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.  If HUD has its way, companies like Facebook will need to address a more fundamental intervention by the government: one that reorients the business model that sits at the heart of the consumer internet, a business model that has repeatedly contributed to challenges to our democracy That\u2019s what we need if we are to preserve vital civil rights protections in the digital age.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. What a big double bill it was \u2013 President Donald Trump taking the world stage for a nuclear summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, just as his former fixer-lawyer, Michael Cohen, was appearing before a Congressional committee for a one-man revue about schemes, lies and porn-star payoffs. Two shows, same theme, wrote Frida Ghitis: a President exposed. \u201cA clear portrait of a morally hollow presidency.\u201d \u201cCohen described a man devoid of principles and determined to win in pursuit of money, power and prestige,\u201d Ghitis said. \u201cAnd, in Hanoi, we saw the risks of having such a man as President.\u201d She was referring, in part, to Trump\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d betrayal of an American citizen, Otto Warmbier, when Trump told the world that he accepted the dictator\u2019s word that Kim didn\u2019t know North Korea had fatally tortured Warmbier.  \u201cTrump has a well-established affinity for dictators, and he\u2019s known for taking their word over that of his own experts,\u201d she noted, citing his absolutions of Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman. Dealmaker Trump left Vietnam empty-handed. But Nathan Park insisted it\u2019s Kim Jong Un who should be feeling the pressure now. \u201cTrump and his unconventional approach to diplomacy represented the best chance for North Korea to win any concession from the United States.\u201d And the explosive allegations on Capitol Hill  (\u201can administration beginning to teeter,\u201d wrote Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times) could mean that Kim doesn\u2019t have much time. Trump might have felt sunnier about things earlier in the week when he tweeted about a Fourth of July bash he was planning at the Lincoln Memorial, featuring an \u201caddress by your favorite President, me!\u201d  But Dean Obeidallah wondered: \u201cPerhaps, come July 4th, Trump wants the American people to show him the same \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018great fervor, as Trump put it, that North Koreans have for Kim?!\u201d Reyna Grande arrived in the U.S. from Mexico speaking not a word of English. On the first day of school, \u201cmy 5th-grade teacher pointed to the farthest corner of her classroom and sent me there. She ignored me for the rest of the year.\u201d Grande and her siblings soon became English dominant, rejecting their mother as \u201ca symbol of what we didn\u2019t want to be \u2013 a working-class, uneducated, non-English-speaking immigrant.\u201d Grande later regretted what she did. And it bothered her for years, until she had children of her own and did something about it.  Hers is a moving and thought-provoking story. Read it and tell us your own stories of speaking a different language in America. CNN founder Ted Turner was joyful over Tuesday\u2019s House passage of a sweeping public lands and conservation bill, but added, \u201cthere is much left to be done.\u201d  \u201cI urge all of us who care about this beautiful country, whether it be because you like to hunt, fish, hike, swim, paddle, watch wildlife, farm, or ranch, to look for those ways that we can connect with each other, and together, protect and steward this land that we all love.\u201d Elijah Cummings, Democrat and chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said lawmakers questioning Michael Cohen Wednesday were after the truth, which the witness insisted he was providing about Donald Trump.  \u201cHe is a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat,\u201d said Cohen, who is facing prison time for lying to Congress earlier. \u201cLiar, liar, pants on fire,\u201d said Arizona Republican, Paul Gosar. For real. Republicans certainly stuck to their \u201cpartisan food fight,\u201d David Axelrod noted. But \u201clistening to Cohen today describe the tasks Trump assigned to him, it occurred to me that lying was an essential demand of the job,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cWho do you assign such tasks? A Boy Scout? A nun?\u201d Republicans have a point, wrote Scott Jennings: \u201cif you lie to Congress once, why are you allowed to come back and try again?\u201d His advice: \u201cIgnore Cohen\u2019s petty personal asides. Ignore the partisan Democrats bloviations. And wait for a reliable narrator \u2014 Robert Mueller \u2014 to give us the truth.\u201d Not really, wrote Holman W. Jenkins, in the Wall Street Journal: \u201cthe Mueller report will settle nothing.\u201d And when the elite media allows the extent to which the FBI meddled in the 2016 presidential race to surface, he maintained, Trump will get reelected. If he doesn\u2019t? Cohen struck an ominous note as the hearing ended.   He said he feared that if Trump loses re-election, \u201cthere will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d  It was a thought that echoed former Obama administration official, Joshua Geltzer, writing for CNN days earlier\u2014and the reason that \u201cfour key sets of governmental actors across the United States\u201d should commit now to steps to thwart Trump if he refuses to step down. More good reads on the hearing: Andrea Gonzalez-Ramirez, in Refinery 29: The Freshman Congresswomen Did Their Damn Job At Cohen\u2019s Hearing Michael D\u2019Antonio: I was one of the 500 people Michael Cohen threatened. Three powerful men made headlines for sickening reasons last week. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and ex-hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein\u2013were linked to separate sex-trafficking investigations, and rapper R. Kelly was charged with criminal sexual abuse. (Kraft says he is innocent and pleaded not guilty to soliciting prostitution, Epstein got his plea deal in 2008 and R. Kelly denies the allegations.) What do the accusations have in common? \u201cThe systematic exploitation of young girls and women who often are poor, vulnerable, ignored and silenced,\u201d wrote Roxanne Jones. \u201cEach of these cases points to a disturbing story of just how easily justice is denied to certain women in America, and how invisible these women remain \u2013 often in their own communities \u2013 despite all the high-profile marches and equality movements.\u201d Raul Reyes wrote that Trump\u2019s Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, needs to resign: he was the Miami US Attorney who cut the deal\u2013kept hidden from Epstein\u2019s victims\u2013 that let Epstein dodge a life sentence.  Epstein served just 13 months in the private wing of the Palm Beach County jail.  A federal judge recently ruled federal prosecutors broke the law on Acosta\u2019s watch.  Acosta\u2019s betrayal is \u201cworthy of bipartisan outrage and should offend every American father and mother,\u201d Reyes wrote. CNN\u2019s town hall with Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday night showed him picking up where he left off in 2016, Errol Louis wrote. But his talking points about income inequality, health care, education and corporate greed\u2014are now Democratic boilerplate.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that Bernie went centrist; instead, the center moved toward him.\u201d Can he persuade voters he\u2019s the best salesman for ideas now copied by others? And those Democratic ideas\u2014like the Green New Deal and Medicare for all\u2013 cost money, wrote libertarian economist Jeffrey Miron and Laura Nicolae. With huge debt levels, \u201crestoring fiscal sanity in the United States requires significant cuts to federal entitlement spending.\u201d On Friday, Washington\u2019s Gov. Jay Inslee became the 13th Democrat to throw a hat in the ring for 2020. Noting the huge Democratic presidential field, along with the 14 candidates who ran in Tuesday\u2019s mayoral election in Chicago and the 17 who vied for public advocate in New York, Jill Filipovic saw encouraging signs of America\u2019s \u201cmove away from political apathy\u201d February, a month ordinarily devoted to celebration and reflection on black history, this time delivered a \u201cdizzying national reckoning\u201d on racial reality, wrote historian Peniel Joseph:  \u201cPoliticians in blackface, a white actor who confessed to murderous racist impulses, a black actor who,\u201d authorities say \u201cfaked his own hate crime, films about race touching off a firestorm at the Oscars and white fragility about confronting racism unfolding in real-time in the House of Representatives during the Michael Cohen hearing.\u201d That last comment referred to Republican Rep. Mark Meadows asking HUD official Lynne Patton to stand behind him during the Cohen hearing to somehow prove that Trump is no racist. Rep. Rashida Tlaib rebuked him for using a black woman as a prop. Meadows\u2019 indignant self-defense, wrote Kashana Cauley in the New York Times, might have been more convincing if not for his repeated comments in 2012 about sending President Obama \u201cback home to Kenya.\u201d  Tlaib apologized, but she got it right the first time, Cauley said. (It was left to Rep. Elijah Cummings to calm the waters after the flare up, a rare moment of \u201ccivility and grace in Washington,\u201d noted Jen Psaki.) A road film about an erudite black pianist and the coarse, big-hearted white man chauffeuring him through the segregated South in the early 1960s beat out the edgier \u201cBlacKKKlansman\u201d and the box-office smash \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\u2013and many were not happy, wrote Gene Seymour. \u201cSimply put, a vote for \u2018Green Book\u2019 represented relative safety and reassurance, while either \u2018Black Panther\u2019 or \u2018BlacKKKlansman would have signaled the opposite: a bolder, brasher and more assertive reflection of Hollywood\u2019s changing racial profile.\u201d Upside?  Spike Lee won for best adapted screenplay and Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler were the first African Americans to win Academy Awards for costume and production design respectively, both for \u2018Black Panther.\u2019 \u201cYou want evidence of change? Here\u2019s a hint: It\u2019s not always staring at you from the screen,\u201d wrote Seymour. Others were less sanguine: \u201c\u2019Green Book\u2019 is the worst best picture Oscar winner since \u2018Crash,\u2019\u201d wrote Justin Chang, in the LA Times: \u201ca shopworn ideal of racial reconciliation propped up by a story that unfolds almost entirely from a white protagonist\u2019s incurious perspective.\u201d Even people who make big bucks can hate their jobs, as Charles Duhigg wrote in a  New York Times Magazine piece headlined: \u201cWealthy, successful and miserable.\u201d That\u2019s not new, wrote Peggy Drexler.  So why does it seem worse today? The stakes are higher, as are the expectations. And \u201can era of self-care and self-empowerment has led many to believe they are entitled to have it all,\u201d she said. What to do?   Seek meaning elsewhere: \u201cfamily time, volunteering. Assign meaning to more than work.\u201d \u2022 Holly Thomas applauds Emma Thompson for pulling out of an animated film after its production company hired John Lasseter\u2014accused of sexual harassment while he was at Pixar\u2013as animation chief. \u2022 Jeffrey Sachs, on the case for the new Medicare for All bill. \u2022 Michael Zeldin and Julian Zelizer, on why America may not get the answers it seeks from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN and The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. It almost sounded like compassion \u2013 compassion for the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \u2013 when President Donald Trump explained that Kim \u201cfelt very badly\u201d about what had happened to Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old American student taken prisoner by Kim\u2019s henchmen for 17 months. Gone were Trump\u2019s charges that Kim runs a \u201cbrutal regime,\u201d which he stated when Warmbier was returned to the Unites States in 2017\u2013 in a coma. He died less than a week later. At a press conference in Hanoi on Thursday, Trump said of Kim, \u201cI will take him at his word.\u201d It was another demeaning moment not only for Trump, who has gushed about the tyrant on several occasions, but also for America. And it was made even more humiliating for the United States when the President heaped additional praise on Kim\u2019s \u201cgreat leadership,\u201d which he said will bring much success to his country. Jim Acosta: This moment was striking and bizarre To be clear, he was referring to a regime that a United Nations investigation concluded commits crimes against humanity that \u201centail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds\u201d \u2013 violations of a gravity and scale \u201cthat (do) not have any parallel in the contemporary world.\u201d That\u2019s whose word Trump accepts. That\u2019s the leadership Trump calls great. Of course, this does not mean that Trump should never meet and be civil with dictators. But gushing is optional \u2013 and, in his case, it appears appallingly sincere. Trump has a well-established affinity for dictators, and he\u2019s known for taking their word over that of his own experts. He took Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s word over that of his own intelligence professionals regarding Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. He took Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s word that he was not involved in the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Meanwhile, the CIA believes the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing. On Khashoggi, the Trump approach appears to be 'ignorance is bliss' But it is with Kim that he has shown the most obsequious behavior, a school-boy crush. \u201cWe fell in love,\u201d he explained, as he sought to make a deal with the dictator in 2018. Trump appears more interested in burnishing his own reputation as a negotiator \u2013 better than his predecessors \u2013 than in almost any other consideration. This week, the two major news events \u2013 Trump meeting Kim in Hanoi, and Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen testifying before Congress \u2013 provided a clear portrait of a morally hollow presidency. Cohen described a man devoid of principles and determined to win in pursuit of money, power and prestige. And, in Hanoi, we saw the risks of having such a man as President. Many were skeptical of a second summit. But Trump had ignored the advice of experts, who tried to tell him a good personal relationship was not enough to persuade Kim to fully surrender his nuclear arsenal. He went with his gut, poorly prepared \u2013 a well prepared summit doesn\u2019t end without even a minor face-saving document \u2013 and had another face-to-face meeting, an approach that has so far helped to cement Kim\u2019s rule by bolstering his standing at home and in the international community. A man who was a pariah on the global stage is now a quasi-respected figure, honored by the praise of, and high-profile summits with, the US President. Collapse of Vietnam summit highlights dangerous fault lines But let\u2019s not forget that North Korea is a dangerous country. It has attacked South Korea time and again and has built a deadly nuclear arsenal. A new risk emerged as Trump turned North Korea into a symbol of his negotiating prowess \u2013 one he tries to use to compare himself favorably to former President Barack Obama and others before him. Early on in his presidency, Trump threatened \u201cfire and fury\u201d against Kim. In his first State of the Union in 2018, he even mentioned human rights, a topic he appears now to have wholly forgotten. \u201cNo regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally and brutally than the cruel dictatorship of North Korea,\u201d he declared, explaining that \u201ccomplacency and concessions\u201d aggravate the risks, and vowing, \u201cI will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.\u201d But then he saw an opportunity to make history, to build his art-of-the-deal brand. As a deal with Kim looked harder to reach, though, Trump made major concessions. According to CNN, he even weighed dropping the fundamental demand that North Korea provide a full accounting of its nuclear and missile programs. The move suggested to experts that, as almost anyone but, apparently, Trump believes, Kim has no intention of getting rid of his nuclear program. Several months later and Trump still seemed determined to get a deal. But it was not to be, at least for now. That\u2019s because while Trump may think he\u2019s cleverly manipulating Kim with his embarrassingly high praise, it is Kim who has Trump\u2019s number. Kim demanded that the US lift economic sanctions before he would dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear facility. If Trump had agreed, the world would have laughed.  Instead, Trump walked away. That came as a relief to those of us who feared a truly disastrous deal. And, yes, he has managed to reduce the temperature in the relationship, lowering the risk of nuclear confrontation for the time being. But in so doing, he has also made the world cringe \u2013 unnecessarily praising a ruthless ruler, and forever tarnishing America\u2019s image as an (admittedly flawed) advocate of human dignity for all. Trump\u2019s performance in Hanoi helps explain why even though Cohen, a convicted liar, has serious credibility problems, his testimony in Congress rang true. Trump has shown the world that principles play a minimal role, if any, in his conduct. He defended and praised the man whose regime\u2019s brutality led to the death of Warmbier, a young American student guilty of the most minor of infractions. It was a shameful day for America.",

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow and is the author of \u201cMy Brother Moochie: Regaining Dignity in the Midst of Crime, Poverty, and Racism in the American South\u201d (Other Press). Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. A white man who helped spread the racist conspiracy that Barack Obama wasn\u2019t really American put a black woman on display, as though at a slave auction, to defend the white man who did more than anyone else to take birtherism national against legitimate charges of racism. Then, that white man reacted with outrage and hurt when a woman of color called him out for what he had done. Though North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows said Thursday he does not support his 2012 comments about sending then-President Obama \u201cback to Kenya,\u201d his stunt during Wednesday\u2019s public hearing with Michael Cohen wasn\u2019t the most revealing moment of the ugliness and complexity of American racial politics that unfolded before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Wednesday. The most illuminating moment came after Meadows told Lynne Patton, a HUD official, to stand like a mute prop so he could literally point to her presence to declare that President Donald Trump couldn\u2019t be racist because a black woman like Patton likes Trump. It was when Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a black man, felt the need to call Meadows a good friend and got a Palestinian-American woman, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, to say that though she was criticizing Meadows\u2019 behavior, she wasn\u2019t claiming he was a racist. The scene harkened back to what was a frequent occurrence in the antebellum South to what historians sometimes refer to as the \u201cMagnolia\u201d and \u201cSable\u201d curtains of race relations. Though it was a time when white people utterly dehumanized black people, white people also convinced themselves that black people believed they were beloved members of the white family and appreciated the guidance of their wiser, more moral counterparts. That lie could only be sustained with the cooperation of black people, who went along with the ruse mostly to fend off white fears about slave rebellions. Patton\u2019s role was particularly instructive, given that she willingly went along with Meadows\u2019 disgusting act. Panelist scorches Meadows for 'laughable' display Literal slavery wasn\u2019t at stake Wednesday, of course. But the exchange, in which Meadows loudly cried foul, said he had black family members and that Cummings was a good friend even after Meadows had \u2013 as Tlaib rightly pointed out \u2013 just committed an ugly, racist act in the committee room, is the latest example of the racial divide that remains in effect in the United States more than a century and a half after the Civil War. It\u2019s no coincidence that Meadows represents North Carolina, where I, too, have lived and where that uneasy existence has never not been in effect \u2013 it\u2019s just changed forms. That\u2019s why, as crazy as it might sound to rational-thinking Americans, Meadows likely genuinely felt hurt by charges of racism, even though he was caught on video multiple times during the 2012 election cycle talking about sending Obama back to Kenya and is one of the most high-profile members of a Republican Party that with  \u201calmost surgical precision\u201d (in the words of the appellate judges who struck them down as unconstitutional) crafted laws to make it harder for black people to vote. In Meadows\u2019 thinking, you can do all that and still not have a \u201cracial bone\u201d in your body \u2013 as long as you have a black person or three to trot out when necessary to vouch for your \u201cgood white man\u201d bona fides. I understand it, because for a long time, I was one of those black people trotted out by supposed white friends who invoked my name any time someone called them racist, including my nearly two-decade-long membership in a mostly white evangelical church. Baldwin: This is not just about hearing, but listening And I used to let them, even after I knew they had crossed into racism or defended a church structure that all but ensured white church members would be the leaders and black ones relegated to following. It felt necessary in order to maintain relationships I knew would mean daily interactions I couldn\u2019t avoid \u2013 and in some ways still cherished. When I began to call them out, they acted as though I had betrayed them, in the same way Meadows acted betrayed even though he had done the dirty deed. It\u2019s just that Meadows didn\u2019t count on Tlaib calling him out, because he didn\u2019t know that Tlaib, a freshman member of Congress whose Palestinian-American heritage tracks from outside the Deep South, didn\u2019t get the memo about the Magnolia and Sable curtains, even as Meadows knew he could count on Cummings to ensure the curtains wouldn\u2019t be fully torn asunder. That speaks to a deeper, developing divide within the Democratic Party. Some members, such as Tlaib, Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Rep. Brenda Lawrence, each of whom called out Meadows\u2019 racist act during the hearing in various ways, have made it clear they have no plans to play by the Magnolia-Sable rules, while Cummings and other Democratic stalwarts still see some usefulness for it. That\u2019s why Democrats are struggling between being frank about Trump voters \u2013 people who knowingly put a bigot in the White House \u2013 and speaking hard truths about current racial divides and soft-pedaling their views about voters who chose Trump in 2016 but might be persuaded to choose differently in 2020.  It\u2019s the kind of tension that bubbles up occasionally during a racial awakening and reckoning. It\u2019s a sign that the long-awaited grappling with the complexity of race has begun and won\u2019t end any time soon.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a consultant to Priorities USA Action, which was a pro-Obama super PAC before it was a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. To write an appreciation that fully captures Harris Wofford\u2019s amazing life is too big a task for this space. His canvas is too large, his story too sweeping, his causes and accomplishments too vast. Suffice to say, if you believe in racial equality, if you share the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., if you admire the Peace Corps, are stirred by the memory of JFK, thought the presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were successful, if you champion the education of women, and believe we can achieve greater unity and community through national service, you should know about Harris Wofford, who left us this week at age 92. After touring India after Gandhi\u2019s death, Wofford and his wife, the estimable Clare Lindgren Wofford, wrote a book in 1951 urging a Gandhian strategy of nonviolent civil disobedience to break segregation. During the Montgomery bus boycott of 1956, he took his ideas straight to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., writing him a letter advising that: \u201cSome jail-going, at least by selected members of your body, would be a wonderful thing for this country and for the world. And I would think if enough of you, in the right cheerful spirit, rode the buses, and went to jail rather than to submit to segregation, the whole silly house of cards might now crumble on bus segregation.\u201d He was one of the first white people to graduate from Howard University Law School, and played a role in the 1957 Civil Rights Act \u2013 the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. Critics rightly pointed out that the bill was weak tea \u2013 it largely left the savagery of segregation intact.  But it did establish the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and the US Commission on Civil Rights. More important, it was a start, and Wofford was a pragmatic idealist: he believed in progress, not perfection. Working in JFK\u2019s campaign, Wofford was instrumental in persuading the candidate to call Coretta Scott King to offer encouragement when her husband had been jailed in Georgia. Mrs. King feared for her husband\u2019s life. At Wofford\u2019s urging, JFK shone a light on King\u2019s dark cell. Robert Kennedy phoned the Georgia judge who\u2019d locked up King, and soon King was a free man and Kennedy (who had voted against even the weak 1957 Civil Rights Act) won the support of African-American voters in his razor-thin victory over Richard Nixon. After serving in the Kennedy White House as special assistant for civil rights, Wofford joined his close friend Sargent Shriver in standing up the Peace Corps. Nearly 58 years later, 230,000 Americans have gone overseas to serve their sisters and brothers in 141 countries. He was an early supporter of, and key adviser, to both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama on their paths to the presidency. Clinton later chose Wofford to lead the Corporation for National and Community Service; Obama bestowed the Presidential Citizens Medal on him. Former senator announces marriage to man At nearly every critical juncture of the last 70 years, it seems Harris Wofford was present at the creation. But he was no mere Zelig who happened to be in the neighborhood when history was happening. Far from it. For seven decades he was deeply engaged in the effort to form a more perfect union. I played a bit role in this amazing man\u2019s life. When Sen. John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican, died tragically in 1991, Gov. Bob Casey appointed Wofford to his seat. Wofford asked me to be his campaign manager in the ensuing special election, a quixotic bid to be the first Democrat to win a Pennsylvania Senate seat since 1962. His opponent was Richard Thornburgh, a popular former two-term governor then serving as President George H.W. Bush\u2019s attorney general. In our first poll, Thornburgh led by 47 points. He didn\u2019t have 47% \u2013 he was leading by 47%. Six months later, Wofford won by 10 points \u2013 a 57% swing. He wasn\u2019t a great fundraiser or an oratorical magician, and he hadn\u2019t mastered the dark arts of negative campaigning. He won his upset-landslide through the rarest of political gifts: vision. A fellow political consultant likes to say, \u201cThose who speak of vision possess it not.\u201d Wofford never touted himself as a visionary \u2013 but that is what he was. He foresaw full equality for African-Americans when segregation was the law of the land, and he marched with Dr. King from Selma to Montgomery to help make it so. Volunteers honor U.S. Peace Corps' 50th He envisioned a Peace Corps that would project America\u2019s moral strength as powerfully as the Army he\u2019d served in projected our military strength, and he moved to Ethiopia to make it so. He envisioned a health care system in which, as he said in his 1991 campaign, \u201cIf a criminal has a right to a lawyer, a sick person should have the right to a doctor\u201d \u2013  and he centered his campaign on it to make it so. He envisioned a national day of service honoring his friend, Dr. King. \u201cA day on, not a day off,\u201d he called it, and sponsored legislation to make it so. He endorsed Barack Obama\u2019s election early and worked enthusiastically to make it so. He envisioned laws that cared not a whit who you fall in love with and marry, and at age 90 married Matthew Charlton in a ceremony rich with family, poetry and song. How to best commemorate such a life? For me the answer is clear: service.  f I try to find a constant in his peripatetic, multifaceted life, it is service. Wofford did not believe in the politics of self-absorption. He did not believe in declaring moral superiority then going home. He believed we are here to serve one another, and that the way to move the country to higher ground was to begin on the common ground of service. From his days in the Army, to his years in the civil rights movement, the Kennedy administration, leading Bryn Mawr College as its president, as Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of labor and industry and a US senator, running the Corporation for National and Community Service, and so much more, Wofford believed we bring out the best in ourselves only when we serve others.  If he were here, he would tell the large and impressive crop of Democratic presidential candidates the same thing he told Bill Clinton in 1992: Make national service central to your campaign and to your presidency. Earning educational benefits by serving \u2013 as young people currently can do in the military, the Peace Corps, and AmeriCorps \u2013 ought to be an option for every American. The divisions in our country, he would say, can\u2019t be solved by mean-tweeting each other. They can only be solved by coming together, working together, serving together. So deep was Wofford\u2019s commitment to national service that, after his 1994 loss to Rick Santorum, he reached out to his foe to persuade him to support service. During the \u201994 campaign, Santorum had derided Wofford\u2019s vision as an excuse \u201cfor hippie kids to stand around a campfire to hold hands and sing \u2018Kumbaya\u2019 at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\u201d Five years later, Santorum\u2019s Senate office was praising both service and Wofford. \u201cThe programs have changed and Harris Wofford has pushed it in a new direction,\u201d said Santorum\u2019s spokesperson at the time. \u201cIt gets people out of government service and into small nonprofits, where they are more facilitators than bureaucrats.\u201d Harris spent more than seven decades not just on the right side of history, but on its leading edge. I can think of no better way to honor this visionary than for Democrats \u2013 and Republicans \u2013 to make service to country a central goal of this Congress and the next election.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. I was a proud supporter of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primaries because of his bold, progressive stances on issues that I still believe represent the best path forward \u2013 not only for the Democratic Party but for the future of our entire nation. Yet I knew Sanders wasn\u2019t perfect. On issues of racial justice, for instance, he was inadequate at best. And, of course, there was the \u201cBernie bro\u201d culture surrounding his campaign, which was, frankly, off-putting. This is all to say that I never put Sanders on a pedestal.  But I\u2019m afraid many Sanders fans are just now learning the problem with imagining your candidate to be beyond reproach. That so many were and still are adamant about the infallibility of their hero candidate, to the point of downright harassing anyone who scrutinized let alone criticized Sanders, makes his apparent mistakes all the more stinging. Bernie Sanders has a problem Bernie Sanders has insisted that he didn\u2019t know about the multiple claims of women within his 2016 campaign infrastructure who complained about sexual harassment as well pay inequity, according to New York Times reporting. In a statement to CNN, Sanders\u2019 campaign committee acknowledged that some HR actions were taken during Sanders\u2019 campaign, but did not go into detail on the allegations that triggered them.  Even if we give Sanders the benefit of the doubt and believe he was unaware of the complaints, he definitely knew about his \u201cBernie bro\u201d supporters, who pointedly and repeatedly attacked female Hillary Clinton supporters online. In an interview with CNN, Sanders said of his \u201cBernie bro\u201d following during the 2016 primary, \u201cI have heard about it. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d  then adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t want that crap. We will do everything we can, and I think we have tried.\u201d But he clearly didn\u2019t try hard enough, as even Sanders\u2019 own campaign manager made sexist remarks about Hillary Clinton.  And the culture, in general, continued. I\u2019m not saying Sanders and his senior team similarly turned a blind eye to sexual harassment within his campaign, but a pattern of denying responsibility while problems persist is emerging. Sanders is now making gestures to fix things, stating that if he runs for president again, he\u2019ll do better, while simultaneously refusing to take ownership, let alone responsibility, for the problem. Sanders says he was not aware of sexual harassment allegations on 2016 campaign, apologizes to women Talking to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper after the allegations came to light, Sanders apologized to women who \u201cfelt harassed\u201d saying, \u201cI am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources,\u201d and claiming that his 2018 Senate re-election campaign had \u201cthe gold standard\u201d when it came to its principles. And, above all, as an excuse for his lack of proper oversight of his campaign, Sanders claimed that he was too busy \u201crunning around the country\u201d campaigning for president \u2013 an argument that doesn\u2019t seem, well, very presidential. I guess we\u2019re supposed to think the \u201cgold standard\u201d for preventing harassment is mandatory training and having an independent firm for women to turn to when they feel harassed? No, the gold standard is taking responsibility for the culture you as a leader create and doing everything in your power, rhetorically and otherwise, to root out toxicity within it. I realize I\u2019m being hard on Bernie Sanders here.  Deal with it. I don\u2019t hold Donald Trump, for instance, to the same standard \u2013 nor does anyone in North America, as far as I can tell.  Bernie Sanders explicitly presented himself as a champion of progressive values, so the bar is inevitably higher for him to live up to what he preaches.  Since I raised these issues on CNN\u2019s airwaves, my Twitter feed has been filled with Bernie supporters accusing me of attacking one of our own. But this isn\u2019t about blind loyalty \u2013 this is about accountability.  And if our principles actually mean anything, we have to apply them to ourselves first and foremost.  Look, I don\u2019t know what actually went on in Sanders\u2019 campaign.  Few of us truly do. But I know that if Sanders took these allegations seriously, not just for the sake of optics but because he genuinely cares about the culture and climate his leadership creates, he would have been less defensive and would have given a clear, emphatic and heartfelt apology. Sen. Sanders, if you\u2019re reading this, try something direct and earnest, like: I honestly didn\u2019t know this was happening inside my campaign but I wish I had because I would have done then what I\u2019m doing now: Apologizing wholeheartedly for the culture that existed within at least parts of my campaign and doing everything in my power to make sure sexual harassment and pay inequity never, ever happen again in any fashion in any organization I\u2019m involved with.  What these women are describing is unacceptable. The buck starts with me and I\u2019m going to do better going forward.",

It\u2019s the first major announcement of what will likely be a crowded Democratic primary in the 2020 race, and potentially the most diverse in history. Watching Warren\u2019s announcement video, you can see her priorities are clear: she wants economic and racial justice and recognizes that the two are neither identical nor severable (unlike too many others on the populist left who believe class is a singular unifying force and racism is a secondary \u201cidentity politics\u201d issue solvable by economic changes alone). She recognizes that equality of opportunity isn\u2019t just about what class you were born into; it\u2019s also about how race and gender shape individual opportunity and mobility. Most strikingly, she doesn\u2019t issue a milquetoast call for unity and change, or demonize some amorphous threat to American families and prosperity. No, she names and shames her villains, from big banks who push for their own deregulation, to self-interested and moneyed politicians who cut their own taxes at the expense of the rest of us, to hate-mongers on Fox News and in the White House who peddle racism and misogyny to stir up an angry, bigoted Republican base. That\u2019s a kind of honesty at the expense of political feel-good-ism that we haven\u2019t seen much of in recent presidential politics. With the vision laid out in her video, Warren has staked out what might just be the ideally unifying position for Democratic voters, at least some of whom are still smarting from (and waging proxy wars out of) the 2016 primary, in which Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders. But while Warren may in theory be the perfect candidate to heal that rift, she\u2019s still a woman \u2013 and that remains more of a liability than we may want to believe. I am a Native American. I have some questions for Elizabeth Warren In 2016, many of the most vocal Bernie Sanders supporters were also some of the most vocal Clinton detractors, feeding into right-wing attacks and amplifying the narratives we now know were also pushed by Russian operatives seeking to sway the election for Donald Trump. Elections are almost never won and lost on a single factor, but this dynamic almost certainly contributed to Clinton\u2019s loss. Along the way, Clinton supporters suggested that their candidate was subject to wildly disproportionate criticism in part because she is a woman, and pointed out that even on the left, many are subconsciously and reflexively hostile to female ambition and pursuit of power. Many of Clinton\u2019s detractors on the left met these observations with howls of indignation. It wasn\u2019t that she was a woman, they said \u2013 it\u2019s because it was her. And then, inevitably, something along the lines of: \u201cI would vote for Elizabeth Warren if she were running.\u201d Well, now she is, so let\u2019s see how that plays out. My prediction: a lot of the same people who swore they weren\u2019t sexist because they would support a hypothetical Warren run will not in fact throw their weight behind an actual Warren run. Sen. Warren exploring a run for president in 2020 They should \u2013 and so should Clinton fans. Or at the very least, we should all welcome a candidate like Warren into the inevitably crowded field. For some, her disputing the president\u2019s characterization of her racial identity was a huge misstep, playing into bad race science and undermining the right of Native Americans to decide tribal identity for themselves. Fair enough \u2013 although, if we are really being fair, Warren didn\u2019t claim tribal membership or an allegiance to race science, and was rather trying to validate an oral family history that the President had smeared as a lie. In any case, one video intended to share her family history and shut up our bully of a President should hardly be disqualifying. Maybe Warren really isn\u2019t your candidate \u2013 that\u2019s okay, too. By the looks of it, there are going to be a great many contenders. She certainly faces an uphill battle based on gender, and those of us on the left should be particularly attuned to the ways in which another eminently qualified woman will inevitably be attacked and undermined for her appearance, her voice, and even a cherry-picking of her record not similarly applied to progressive men in the field. But Warren has done us all an immense favor by kicking her campaign off the way she did: she is setting the narrative, and insisting it focuses on class and race, economic inequality and gender inequality, and all of the ways in which our identities, and America\u2019s history of racism and sexism indelibly shape who has opportunity, when and how.  It\u2019s a brilliant beginning, and even if she doesn\u2019t ultimately earn your vote, Warren has drawn the lines of the race \u2013 and launched from a crucial starting point.",

            "article_content": "Voters in Kansas City, Missouri, decided to remove Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s name from a historic boulevard that was renamed in January to honor the civil rights leader. In a special election Tuesday, the measure to change Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. back to The Paseo Boulevard received about 65% of the vote, according to figures released by the city\u2019s Board of Election Commissioners. The vote came after months of debate between groups intent on honoring King\u2019s legacy and some residents who didn\u2019t want to lose their neighborhood\u2019s identity. The Paseo, as many locals call it, is one of the oldest boulevards in the city and runs north to south through a predominately African American section of the city. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind doing something to honor Dr. King, but we don\u2019t want you to take Paseo away from us to do it,\u201d said former City Councilwoman Alissia Canady, who represented much of the area until her term ended in August. She helped organize the Save The Paseo group, which collected almost 3,000 signatures to get the name change on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. Canady voted against the MLK name change in January, but it passed by an 8-4 vote. \u201cThat really infuriated the neighborhood because they felt it was a backdoor approach that deviated from the process and took away their voice,\u201d Canady said. That caused tensions between residents and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Kansas City, which worked for three years to get the boulevard named after King. \u201cThese boulevards are treasured in Kansas City and rightfully so,\u201d said Vernon Percy Howard Jr., the group\u2019s president. On this day in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech He said Tuesday\u2019s vote makes Kansas City once again one of the few major cities that does not have a road honoring King. \u201cFor 51 years since Dr. King\u2019s assassination, no one in this town moved forward to advance or develop any kind of plan or program to honor Dr. King in a major way,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThere is a park that is embarrassing in the central core of Kansas City that\u2019s not well kept and very small and insignificant with respect to any of its beauty, its architecture, its land space, its footprint and all of that.\u201d Howard said he was surprised by the resistance to change. \u201cI am shocked at the vigor and hostility that has been expressed from some African Americans, who view that that generic name has more weight or carries more significance to them than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who shed his blood and died for our right and our ability to own homes, to obtain loans, to have equal employment opportunities, to be protected from racial discrimination in the workplace in housing, in public transportation and so forth,\u201d he said. He also blamed gentrification of the area and an influx of money from white investors for the opposition. \u201cIt is the epitome of white privilege and systemic and structural racism that a predominately white group would actually have the audacity to determine or dictate in a predominately African American community who, or what they should honor, and where and how,\u201d Howard said. Canady, who is black, called that a deflection. \u201cThe majority of the property owners on Paseo are black, the residents and property owners are black,\u201d she said. \u201cThe majority of the businesses, the majority of the residents are black. So this is black leaders oppressing the voices of black property owners.\u201d She said they weren\u2019t respectful to the wishes of the community. \u201cThey were trying to do a good thing, but they went about it the wrong way,\u201d she said. Canady said she favored naming the city\u2019s new airport terminal after King, or an east-west street because it would run through black and white neighborhoods. University of Tennessee geography professor Derek Alderman and his research team have been building a database of streets named after MLK for more than 20 years. He says they have identified 955 streets named for King in 41 states as well as Washington and Puerto Rico as of December 2017. That includes streets that use his full name or variations such as MLK or M.L. King, but not streets that are simply named King because they may not reference the civil rights leader. \u201cI can confidently confirm that among the top 50 most populated cities (as of 2015 estimates), Kansas City is now one of just three cities without a street named for Dr. King. The other two cities are San Jose, California, and Omaha, Nebraska,\u201d he said. Those cities do have public buildings named for King, he said. Howard and his supporters said they still think naming a road after King is the best way forward. Mayor Quinton Lucas was on the city council in January and supported the MLK name change. He told CNN affiliate WDAF on Wednesday that his job now is to bring the community together, so that residents can honor King. \u201cPeople want to make sure that we engage with enough different community stakeholders and I think it\u2019s fair to say that this did not happen, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of in the position we are now,\u201d he told the station. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t so much a repudiation of the Dr. King name or any ministers involved. It\u2019s instead saying, \u2018Let\u2019s make sure we work together and get it done right.\u2019\u201d",

The Pentagon has been ordered by President Trump to work up potential responses to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities. But defense officials won\u2019t be moving too quickly. The President wants to wait for Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders\u00a0to decide on a response before any action is taken.

Twenty-two years ago today Hong Kong was handed over to China by the British. Protesters marked the anniversary by trying to smash their way into Hong Kong\u2019s government headquarters. Young, masked protesters used metal bars and trolleys as battering rams to try to break the doors of headquarters as riot police watched from the inside. Hong Kong has been in political crisis for weeks after mass demonstrations started over a controversial extradition bill. The city\u2019s chief executive has pulled the bill, but the protests have continued. Click here to keep up with the latest on today\u2019s unrest. If the Democrats thought the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s first official impeachment-related hearing would refocus the public\u2019s attention on ex-special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, they were sadly mistaken. Two former White House aides who had been subpoenaed didn\u2019t show up. And the one witness who did appear \u2013 former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2013 stonewalled and frustrated the Democrats on the panel so much that chairman Jerry Nadler threatened to hold him in contempt. During his appearance, Lewandowski did confirm\u00a0one of the buzzier parts of the Mueller report: that President Trump told him to order\u00a0then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the Mueller investigation so it would only look for future election-meddling \u2013 and stop probing his 2016 campaign. But Lewandowski didn\u2019t carry out Trump\u2019s order. What happened yesterday shows just how much the Democrats are struggling to hold Trump accountable, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says.\u00a0Their probes have been stymied by\u00a0White House claims of executive privilege, uncooperative witnesses who still support Trump and lawsuits that are bogged down in court. People have been paying lots of attention to the fires in the Amazon, but there\u2019s a group of fires on the other side of the world we all need to keep an eye on, too. About 800,000 acres of ecologically rich land have been burned in Indonesia, engulfing the region in a thick toxic haze. The unhealthy air has reached Singapore and Malaysia, too. The blazes are the result of slash-and-burn techniques to clear land, the same practices that led to the fires in the Brazilian Amazon. Indonesia\u2019s National Police arrested 185 people in connection with the fires. Governments in the region are scrambling to find solutions, with Indonesia and Malaysia using cloud-seeding methods to try to artificially start rain. Houston braces for heavy flooding this morning, after the fast-moving Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall yesterday in southeast Texas. Imelda is now a tropical depression and could dump 6 to 10 inches of rain across the region. That would be the heaviest rainfall Houston has seen since Hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Bermuda is dealing with Hurricane Humberto. The Category 3 storm is expected to pass dangerously close to the island territory tonight. Cokie Roberts was a broadcast journalism legend, but she was so much more than that. Roberts \u2013 who died yesterday at age 75 \u2013 was also a prolific writer, authoring a number of books and a syndicated newspaper column. More importantly, she was a trailblazer who tore down barriers for female journalists during her career of more than 40 years. The three-time Emmy winner was best known for her work with ABC News, but her top-notch reporting and keen political analysis were also on display on NPR and PBS. In a statement announcing her death, ABC News President James Goldston said, \u201cCokie\u2019s kindness, generosity, sharp intellect and thoughtful take on the big issues of the day made ABC a better place and all of us better journalists.\u201d Don\u2019t show me the money Virginia\u2019s basketball coach was in line for a big raise after winning the national championship.

President Trump seemed to point the finger more forcefully at Iran as being behind\u00a0the weekend drone attack on a Saudi oil field. He also insisted he doesn\u2019t want a war with Iran, all the while talking up America\u2019s military might. So, it\u2019s just not clear at this point what the US response would be, if any, if it were indeed proven that the Iranians were behind the devastating attack, which knocked out almost half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil capacity. Iran denies any involvement in the drone strikes. Oil prices have fallen slightly after skyrocketing after the attack. It\u2019s Election Day \u2013 again \u2013 in Israel. Voters there are hitting the polls for the second time in five months after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government. Once again, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party is in a tight race with the Blue and White Party, led by Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival, Benny Gantz. Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, is doing all he can to fire up his right-wing base and playing up his close relationship with US President Donald Trump, who is quite popular there. But, CNN correspondent Oren Liebermann notes, Trump\u2019s popularity may not be enough to get Netanyahu over the finish line this time. A House Judiciary Committee hearing today might be missing a little something \u2013 the witnesses. The panel, which is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment against President Trump, has subpoenaed ex-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House aides\u00a0Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter. But Dearborn and Porter probably won\u2019t be there to testify because the White House asserted immunity for them. Lewandowski is expected to attend, but he may not say much because the White House has told him not to answer questions about his conversations with the President where executive privilege could be invoked. Democrats on the committee reject the Trump administration\u2019s immunity and executive privilege arguments, with committee chairman Jerry Nadler calling them \u201cshocking and dangerous.\u201d There\u2019s a shortage of police in Minneapolis, and that law enforcement absence is being felt in the city\u2019s downtown district.

            "article_content": "The impeachment drama closing out 2019 and ringing in 2020 is emblematic of a year and political era where the value of truth and fact is being eroded. President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have profited by feeding misinformation to an eager, partisan audience through a conservative media filter to discredit the charges against him. Democrats have tried to counter his spoiler tactics by amassing an detailed case against the President over his pressure on Ukraine for political favors. The strategy has precluded a debate between the two parties over whether Trump\u2019s behavior infringes the values and conduct long expected of Presidents \u2013 since Democrats are working from facts and Republicans frequently simply refuse to recognize incriminating evidence. The President\u2019s insistence that his behavior is \u201cperfect\u201d and his tight hold on conservative voters has even deprived GOP lawmakers of a face-saving defense that was once used by Bill Clinton\u2019s partisans \u2013 that what he did was unacceptable but not impeachable. The contest between facts and details and the President\u2019s alternative narratives might also offer a 2020 election preview, when Trump is likely to offer an expansive view of a historically successful presidency that might not bear much relation to reality on many points but could prove deeply attractive to voters \u2013 especially thanks to the apparent ongoing strength of the US economy on Trump\u2019s watch. In an age when partisans can find news coverage to suit their facts, it\u2019s no surprise that GOP senators have neither the interest nor political space to criticize the President, let alone censure him or kick him out of office. One of the most remarkable features of the impeachment saga is how even congressional institutionalists like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been willing to cede control of their party to Trump. Republicans are sticking to a simple strategy to save Trump\u2019s presidency that\u2019s guided them throughout the impeachment crisis: avoid talking about and unearthing new evidence of his conduct at all costs. That approach is anchoring the Republican position as Democrats demand more witnesses, documents and transparency in a pre-holidays showdown over the terms of the Senate trial of Trump expected to begin in early January. McConnell has said he is working closely with the White House counsel on arrangements for the trial \u2013 leading to claims he has ditched a duty to be an independent juror. The President is also leading the rhetorical charge ahead of the Senate trial. \u201cPelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the US Congress, and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate, and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once, she will do it again!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. The role of the House of Representatives in impeachment is to investigate and charge a President. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, the trial is the duty of the Senate alone. With Congress out of town until next year and Trump at his Florida resort, the battle over impeachment degenerated into a series of transcontinental tweets and soundbites. \u201cPresident Trump blocked his own witnesses and documents from the House, and from the American people, on phony complaints about the House process. What is his excuse now?\u201d Pelosi asked in a tweet on Monday. The emerging scenario in the Republican-controlled Senate ahead of the Trump trial mirrors what happened in the Democratic-run House. There, Democrats called witnesses who testified that Trump leaned on Ukraine\u2019s President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 rival, using military aid as well as the prospect of a White House visit as leverage. Republicans spun counter-factual narratives and tried to speak about almost everything but Trump\u2019s actions in Ukraine. The trouble is, new information keeps pouring out. Over the weekend, it emerged that a White House budget official put a freeze on nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine within 90 minutes of Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. The revelations emerged in emails released by the Office of Management and Budget in response to a FOIA request by the Center for Public Integrity. They suggested that new details that could damage the President might emerge from new document disclosures during the Senate trial. But McConnell, stuck in an impasse with his opposite number \u2013 Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2013 over the shape of the trial, is declining to engage, arguing that the Senate is not in the business of making the Democrats\u2019 case and that the trial is hardly the place for fresh evidence. McConnell is far keener to hammer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for failing to transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate, a course of action apparently meant to bolster Schumer\u2019s hand. \u201cWe can\u2019t take up a matter we don\u2019t have. So hopefully it\u2019ll be on the way over at some point,\u201d McConnell deadpanned in a news conference with Kentucky reporters on Monday. Opening a new transparency offensive Monday, Schumer issued a fresh call for documents from the White House, State Department and other agencies. \u201cThere simply is no good reason why evidence that is directly relevant to the conduct at issue in the articles of impeachment should be withheld from the Senate and the American people,\u201d Schumer said. The pre-holiday showdown reflects an understanding on both sides about what the next stage of impeachment is really about \u2013 given the certainty that there is no two-thirds majority in the Republican-led chamber to convict Trump of the high crimes and misdemeanors with which he\u2019s charged. It\u2019s in the interest of Democrats to leave an impression after the trial that Republicans covered up abuses of power and constitutional chicanery by the President that they can argue to 2020 voters should deprive him of a second term. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a trial not having documents and witnesses,\u201d Schumer said Monday. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have documents and witnesses, it\u2019s going to appear to the American people that it\u2019s a sham trial.\u201d Republicans need to get out of the trial after thwarting such Democratic goals and by sparing the President damage that could backfire on vulnerable swing state Republicans seeking reelection. McConnell\u2019s unwillingness to expand the case reflects the fact that the pattern of evidence unearthed during the impeachment process has not helped the President. If White House officials had information that would clear him of abusing his power over Ukraine, McConnell might be keen to hear from the likes of former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. McConnell\u2019s arguments have been bolstered, however, by the decision by Democrats not to take court action to challenge Trump\u2019s refusal to allow key witnesses to testify. House Democratic leaders reasoned that such action could take months \u2013 even years \u2013 and argued that the President represented a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the Constitution. They instead opted to charge Trump with obstructing Congress in the second article of impeachment. McConnell seized on that decision on Monday to justify his reluctance to agree to Schumer\u2019s demands for witnesses in the Senate trial expected to start early next year. \u201cWhat the House could have done is to go to court to try to compel the attendance and they didn\u2019t do that,\u201d McConnell said on Fox News on Monday. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do that. They just blew right through that and accused the president of doing something improper by simply invoking executive privilege which every President has done.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House still seeks former White House counsel Don McGahn\u2019s testimony and secrets from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, saying that Mueller\u2019s work is relevant in a Senate trial of President Donald Trump and that the President could face more articles of impeachment in the future because he is still under investigation The arguments made to an appeals court on Monday amount to a broad catalogue of Democrats\u2019 thinking about the two historic investigations of the President \u2013 the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine investigation that led to the President\u2019s impeachment \u2013 and how they fit together. The arguments come as Democratic members of Congress publicly push the White House to turn over more documents and to allow witnesses to appear for testimony during a Senate trial. The Trump administration and Republican Senate leadership have refused both requests. \u201cThe Committee\u2019s investigations did not cease with the House\u2019s recent impeachment vote,\u201d the House wrote to an appeals court on Monday. Both the House and the Justice Department on Monday wrote a series of arguments to the circuit court, addressing how the impeachment of the President affects both the House\u2019s need for McGahn\u2019s testimony and the Mueller details. The Justice Department, representing the White House and McGahn as well as its own interests, has broadly argued that the courts shouldn\u2019t step in to give the House the information it seeks. The fight over McGahn\u2019s testimony could either lead appeals courts to strike down or endorse the White House\u2019s claims of absolute immunity for former and current officials who receive congressional subpoenas. That type of ruling could have major implications for a Senate trial, no matter its focus. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee said it has needed McGahn to testify and that it needed to review the Mueller grand jury information as part of possibly impeaching Trump for obstruction of justice. But Trump hasn\u2019t been impeached for obstruction of justice \u2013 such as on the findings from Mueller that he attempted to obstruct the Russia investigation that came after McGahn gave key statements to criminal prosecutors. Trump wasn\u2019t charged with a crime, though Mueller outlined several legal reasons why Trump allegedly obstructed justice. Instead, the attorney general and then-deputy attorney general chose not to prosecute Trump. The House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power related to his pressure on Ukraine for a political favor and for obstructing Congress, including not allowing former White House officials to testify, just like the White House has done with McGahn. McGahn has refused to testify to the House Judiciary Committee since April about what he witnessed Trump say and do regarding the Russia investigation. Mueller reported that McGahn spoke to prosecutors and the FBI several times about Trump\u2019s direction to fire Mueller, among other things. \u201cUnderstanding President Trump\u2019s history of obstruction would be important to the House\u2019s presentation of the evidence and the Senate\u2019s consideration of the second Article of Impeachment,\u201d obstruction of Congress, the House wrote to the DC Circuit Court on Monday. \u201cFor example, if McGahn confirms to the Committee that the President ordered him to fire Special Counsel Mueller\u2014an event that President Trump has publicly disputed\u2014 and then tried to cover it up, that testimony would constitute powerful evidence of the pattern of obstructive behavior described in the second Article,\u201d the House writes in the new filing in DC Circuit Court. Separately, \u201cIf McGahn\u2019s testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House, the Committee will proceed accordingly\u2014including, if necessary, by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment,\u201d the House wrote. If McGahn were ordered by a court to appear for congressional testimony under a subpoena, he may still be able to use the President\u2019s assertions of executive privilege to decline to answer some questions. The Justice Department, representing McGahn, countered on Monday that the courts should stay out of the dispute. It\u2019s especially problematic for the courts to resolve the testimony standoff, the Justice Department argues, while the Senate tries the President for obstructing Congress. \u201cIndeed, if this court now were to resolve the merits question in this case, it would appear to be weighing in on a contested issue in any impeachment trial. That would be of questionable propriety whether or not such a judicial resolution preceded or post-dated any impeachment trial,\u201d the Justice Department wrote just after midnight early Monday. \u201cThe now very real possibility of this Court appearing to weigh in on an article of impeachment at a time when political tensions are at their highest levels \u2013 before, during, or after a Senate trial regarding the removal of a President \u2013 puts in stark relief why this sort of interbranch dispute is not one that has \u2018traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Politically, more articles of impeachment against Trump seem unlikely at this time. But in court, the House has argued to keep the McGahn case alive so it can keep its investigative options open and gather more information during the Senate trial. On Monday, the House committee wrote that it wants the information collected by Mueller\u2019s grand jury for the upcoming Senate impeachment trial. The information may speak to a \u201cpattern of soliciting foreign election interference and obstructing government investigations of his misconduct.\u201d The House added on Monday that its Judiciary Committee is considering legislation that could change how the White House and Justice Department interact regarding civil and criminal matters. The committee is also considering placing reporting requirements on \u201cforeign offers of assistance,\u201d according to the filing. But the Trump administration said the House should no longer need grand jury secrets following its impeachment vote last Wednesday. Trump was impeached for his dealings with Ukraine and not his attempts to obstruct the Mueller investigation or other Russia-related findings, the Justice Department argued in another filing to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals Monday. \u201cNeither article of impeachment adopted by the House, however, alleges high crimes or misdemeanors stemming from the events described in the Mueller Report,\u201d the Justice Department writes in its latest filing. \u201cAccordingly, nothing appears to remain of the Committee\u2019s alleged need for the grand-jury materials in the Mueller Report.\u201d Previously, the House highlighted that it wants the grand jury details, such as testimony from the convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, because transcripts and other documents could show Trump lied to Mueller about his knowledge of his political adviser\u2019s efforts with WikiLeaks during the campaign. The court filings on Monday come in two of the most potentially significant court cases that could be resolved during Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings. Both the McGahn and grand jury secrets cases are set to be heard by three-judge panels on January 3 at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington. The House won both cases in the lower court. Historically, federal courts try to stay out of clashes between the executive branch and Congress, or Congress and the Justice Department have negotiated before an appeals court settled disputes over administration witnesses. Yet a trial-level judge in Washington, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, ruled in late November that McGahn would have to testify. The White House couldn\u2019t claim a blanket immunity to override a congressional subpoena of a former official, the judge wrote. Separately, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court wrote that the House\u2019s investigation of the President was valid, and in some ways continued the work of the Mueller grand jury. Howell ruled that the House could view the secret Mueller grand jury information.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Jared Golden, a freshman Democrat who represents a Maine congressional district President Donald Trump won in 2016, said in a statement Tuesday that he will split his vote on articles of impeachment, voting to approve the article accusing Trump of abuse of power and against the article on obstruction of Congress. In a lengthy statement posted to Facebook, Golden said Trump\u2019s \u201cactions are a realization of the Framers\u2019 greatest fears: foreign corruption of our electoral process, and a president willing to leverage the powers of his office to benefit his own reelection. This action crossed a clear red line, and in my view, there is no doubt that this is an impeachable act. For this reason, I will vote for Article I of the House resolution to impeach President Trump for an abuse of power.\u201d But, the congressman said, \u201cwhile the president\u2019s resistance toward our investigative efforts has been frustrating, it has not yet, in my view, reached the threshold of \u2018high crime or misdemeanor\u2019 that the Constitution demands. For that reason, I will vote against Article II of the House resolution regarding obstruction of Congress.\u201d Golden is the first House Democrat to announce a split decision on the articles of impeachment, which will receive a final vote on the House floor on Wednesday amid the historic impeachment push. Democrats who represent districts won by Trump in the 2016 presidential election face a tough decision over how to vote on the articles, but so far most have announced they plan to vote in support of impeachment. Over the past several days, the vast majority of those 31 members have thrown their support behind both articles. Only one Democrat \u2013 Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2013 has said definitively that he plans to vote against both articles, but he is also expected to soon switch parties to become a Republican, though he has not yet publicly confirmed the move. Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota may also vote against the articles, but has not yet said how he plans to vote. In his statement, Golden called impeachment \u201ca gravely serious issue\u201d and said he wants the public to \u201chave the opportunity to hear why I plan to vote the way I do straight from me.\u201d \u201cWhile I do not dispute that the White House has been provocative in its defiance and sweeping in its claims of executive privilege, I also believe there are legitimate and unresolved constitutional questions about the limits of executive privilege, and that before pursuing impeachment for this charge, the House has an obligation to exhaust all other available options,\u201d he wrote.",

            "article_content": "Even before Donald Trump is impeached, the partisanship of his looming Senate trial is casting doubt on whether polarized Washington can hold a President to account \u2013 now and in the future. Democrats on Sunday accused Republicans of subverting bedrock values on which America is founded after Republican Senate leadership abandoned any notion that they had not pre-judged the case. Furious exchanges came three days before the Democratic-led House is expected to vote to saddle Trump with the historic shame of impeachment over his demand for favors from Ukraine. The bitterness underscored how the saga has deepened divisions highlighted by Trump and how his power over the GOP is causing party lawmakers to ignore or deny the grave charges against him. Democrats concerned about McConnell's White House impeachment coordination The President, meanwhile, fulminated on Twitter all weekend, inciting fresh political uproar to intimidate vulnerable House Democrats and to electrify the base he needs for reelection. But there were also signs that the last few weeks have inflicted lasting political damage on the commander in chief as a new Fox News poll showed fully half the American voters back impeachment. Trump is facing two articles of impeachment \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress \u2013 over his pressure on Ukraine, including for a probe into one of his Democratic 2020 challengers, Joe Biden. The House rules committee will meet Tuesday to discuss next steps for a full House vote to make Trump the third impeached President as early as Wednesday. An already fevered atmosphere over impeachment deteriorated further during the weekend after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was working closely with the White House counsel to prepare for a Senate trial next year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made it clear in a letter to McConnell Sunday night that he prefers a Senate impeachment trial with witness testimony and new documents. In the letter obtained by CNN, Schumer, a New York Democrat, called for at least four witnesses to testify, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton, senior adviser to the acting White House chief of staff Robert Blair and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey. McConnell spokesman David Popp said Sunday night that \u201cLeader McConnell has made it clear he plans to meet with Leader Schumer to discuss the contours of a trial soon. That timeline has not changed.\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Republicans earlier Sunday of ignoring their duties under the Constitution in prejudging the evidence in an already all-but-certain push to acquit Trump. \u201c(Senators) have to pledge to do impartial justice. And here you have the majority (leader) of the Senate, in effect the foreman of the jury, saying he\u2019s going to work hand in glove with the defense attorney,\u201d Nadler, a New York Democrat, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s in violation of the oath that they\u2019re about to take, and it\u2019s a complete subversion of the constitutional scheme.\u201d On Saturday, Republican Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in Doha that he wasn\u2019t pretending to be a \u201cfair juror.\u201d He went further on Sunday, saying he wanted to dispense with the Senate trial as quickly as possible. \u201cI (have) clearly made up my mind. I\u2019m not trying to hide the fact that I have disdain for the accusations and the process. So I don\u2019t need any witnesses,\u201d Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Graham is among a number of Republicans who want to resolve the trial as soon as possible, given the almost certain lack of a two-thirds Senate majority needed to convict Trump. Republicans have done little to directly repudiate damning evidence from senior officials unearthed by the House impeachment investigation. They have instead accepted Trump\u2019s claims that his behavior was \u201cperfect\u201d and now argue that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense since it is not a crime \u2013 even though foreign interference in a US election was perhaps a fear that preoccupied the founders more than any other. They have also criticized the way Democrats ran the impeachment inquiry in the House. 'I'm not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here': Graham predicts Trump impeachment will 'die quickly' in Senate Republican senators seem to want to avoid the possibility that Trump\u2019s hopes to put up favorable witnesses in a televised show featuring his pet conspiracy theories could besmirch the dignity of their chamber and backfire politically. But Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who called Trump a \u201cclear and present danger to democracy,\u201d argued that the Senate should call witnesses in the trial in order to properly consider the case made on the other side of Capitol Hill. \u201cI think there are any number of witnesses that should be called in a Senate trial, and many witnesses the American people would like to hear from that the administration has refused to make available,\u201d Schiff said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think we see clearly what\u2019s going on here with the comments of Lindsey Graham and others, and that is they don\u2019t want the American people to see the facts,\u201d Schiff said. But on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky argued that Trump was well within his rights to hold back nearly $400 million in US military aid to Ukraine over concerns about corruption in the former Soviet state. \u201cWhen the Democrats say, \u2018oh, we damaged national security\u2019 by holding up for 55 days \u2026 money that was going to Ukraine, I say, well, we shouldn\u2019t do it in the first place,\u201d Paul, a skeptic of most foreign aid, said. Claims that Trump was primarily concerned about corruption in Ukraine are likely to take center stage in the Senate trial. But their credibility is challenged because the President did not actually mention such wider worries in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He did specifically ask for an investigation into Biden. And a crackdown on corruption has not been at the center of administration foreign policy in any other nation. Trump is showing every sign that he will become even more unrestrained after he is impeached. He met Friday with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2013 who is just back from Ukraine on a mission to dig for dirt against Biden \u2013 the exact conduct that helped trigger the impeachment drama in the first place. And on a weekend Twitter tear, the President picked up on a new Republican line of defense that there was no case to answer because he asked Zelensky to do \u201cus\u201d a favor \u2013 as in the US \u2013 rather than a personal favor for himself. \u201cA PERFECT phone call. \u2018Can you do us (not me. Us is referring to our Country) a favor.\u2019 Then go on to talk about \u2018Country\u2019 and \u2018U.S. Attorney General,\u2019 \u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Impeachment Hoax is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which has been going on for 3 years. We will win!\u201d Trump\u2019s claim is however undermined because his request to Zelensky referred to a conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2020 election. Freshman Democrats push for Amash to be impeachment manager in Senate trial, source says It is not clear why that favor \u2013 relating to a personal political obsession of Trump \u2013 would be in the national interest. A conventional interpretation of US interests in Ukraine would center on supporting a government under siege from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Trump also tried to persuade Democratic New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who is against impeachment, to switch sides. If Van Drew crosses the floor, he would be greeted as a hero by Republicans. But Democrats will argue he is quitting because his opposition to impeachment has alienated his own party supporters. Five of Van Drew\u2019s staffers quit Sunday night, saying they can \u201cno longer in good conscience continue our service,\u201d according to a resignation letter obtained by CNN. A sixth also resigned. It is not a surprise that partisan feelings are shaping the impeachment end game \u2013 after all, by its nature, it is a political process prone to shaping by public opinion. And Democrats have offered Republicans an opening by declining to challenge Trump\u2019s refusal to provide key witnesses and testimony under a claim of absolute executive privilege in the courts, reasoning it would take too long. Yet the partisan approach of the GOP underscores the fact that for most Republicans, even admitting any kind of wrongdoing by the President would be akin to political suicide. That\u2019s why this impeachment drama \u2013 unlike Bill Clinton\u2019s 20 years ago \u2013 has not involved calls for an apology from the President for his own side or any discussion about whether he has transgressed, albeit in a way that does not merit impeachment. The absence of such discussion is one reason why this impeachment showdown could have a long legacy as it will effectively enshrine a precedent of a President using executive power to lean on a foreign country for his personal political gain. And the Republican chorus that Trump did nothing wrong and a refusal to even examine an impeachment case suggests a blueprint for future scandals. The party of an unrestrained President could henceforth spare him or her from scrutiny as long as they control the Senate and there is no super majority to convict.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is looking to survive impeachment the same way he built his powerful presidency \u2013 by assaulting facts and seeking to expand the limitations of the office he is accused of abusing. On the day that Democrats proposed two articles of impeachment against him, the President and his courtiers laid down a fresh fog to obscure the evidence that incriminates him. The President also issued a mocking defense of his conduct at a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night \u2013 arguing that the charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress are \u201cnot even a crime.\u201d \u201cEveryone said this is impeachment-lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country, by far. It\u2019s not even like an impeachment,\u201d Trump said. Read: The most important documents related to the Trump impeachment inquiry Attorney General William Barr, meanwhile, reprised his role spinning his boss out of trouble, dismissing his own department\u2019s watchdog report that debunked Trump\u2019s repeated claim that a \u201cDeep State\u201d coup tried to bring him down. Barr also breathed fresh life into another of Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories \u2013 that the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was unjustified and rooted in political bias by Obama administration officials. \u201cI think our nation was turned on its head for three years, I think, based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by an irresponsible press,\u201d Barr said Tuesday in an interview with NBC News. The comments reflected the tendency of the Trump administration to deflect damning facts and to create new narratives that the President and his fans find more appealing. Trump\u2019s never-ending stream of misinformation, half-truths and conspiracy theories seems designed to confuse voters and to create ambiguity and uncertainty about the outcome of investigations in a way that leaves even the closest observer unsure about the facts. One expert in the work of such propagandists is former World Chess Champion and Russian political dissident Garry Kasparov. \u201cThey know that, you know, they can get people exhausted, they exhaust critical thinking,\u201d Kasparov told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper last week. \u201cI always call Putin (a) merchant of doubt. But now seeing what\u2019s happening in America, it\u2019s when just Republicans managed to turn the whole political process in this alternative reality. It\u2019s like a post-truth world.\u201d For Trump, it all started in the opening hours of the administration when he sent then-press secretary Sean Spicer out on a mission to mislead reporters about the size of his inaugural crowd. According to the latest Washington Post count, Trump has made more than 13,400 false or misleading claims in office. Trump\u2019s incessant torrent of attacks \u2013 on Twitter and on camera, amplified by conservative media outlets \u2013 has helped to insulate him against the consequences of his actions. Though former special counsel Robert Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s team and Russia, he did find alarming evidence that the President expected to profit from Russian election meddling. But Trump\u2019s verbal barrage politicized the former FBI director\u2019s once unblemished public reputation and helped swamp his findings and draw the sting from their ultimate impact. Democrats unveil two articles of impeachment against Trump The President is using the same tactic in the impeachment inquiry, and has been partially successful in drowning out the consequences of damning testimony about his pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The relentless wave of disinformation complicates the task of Democrats seeking to build a public case against the President. And it shapes a new narrative which Trump\u2019s supporters and media cheerleaders can buy into and adorn. That\u2019s what is happening when Republicans like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy spread conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the US election in 2016. They are not only reflecting the strength of Trump\u2019s hold on Republican voters and capacity to get lawmakers to toe the line. They are blurring the public record. Given such head-fakery, the Democrats\u2019 failure to convince seemingly any Republicans of Trump\u2019s wrongdoing hardly seems surprising. Another parallel between the climax of the Mueller report and the findings released by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz into the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation is in the role of Barr. In both cases, the attorney general downplayed the most damaging aspects of the report for Trump and played up highlights that fit best into the President\u2019s political narrative. And with the Horowitz report, Barr went a step further, declaring that his own investigation, conducted by US Attorney John Durham, will offer a more definitive version of the decisions made by the FBI in the Russia investigation. \u201c(Horowitz) is not definitively ruling that there was no bias. I think that\u2019s why we have Durham,\u201d Barr said Tuesday. His comments raise doubts about his and Durham\u2019s independence and could open him to claims he is leaning on the investigation to provide a finding more palatable to the President. Fact-checking Bill Barr's comments on the Russia investigation IG report Barr\u2019s return to the spotlight sheds insight into a more subtle tactic that the President is using to stave off impeachment \u2013 his concept that there are few limits to his permissible actions. The attorney general is an enthusiast of a concept of an all-powerful presidency. He effectively auditioned for the job in an unsolicited memo to the White House that assailed Mueller\u2019s theory on obstruction of justice. On Tuesday, Barr dismissed the second article of impeachment drawn up by Democrats, arguing that Trump was within his power to reject multiple witnesses and document requests based on a claim of \u201cabsolute immunity.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the case where somebody, including a branch of government, is asserting a legal privilege that they have under the law that that constitutes obstruction,\u201d Barr said. In many cases, Trump and his defenders do not present a detailed counter to the facts of the impeachment case. They simply argue that everything Trump did was within his rights. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, for instance, said Tuesday: \u201cThe President will address these false charges in the Senate and expects to be fully exonerated, because he did nothing wrong.\u201d It should be noted that this version of a hyper-powerful executive smashing Washington\u2019s establishment power structures was what helped win Trump the White House and retains a strong appeal to his supporters. Trump\u2019s dual-pronged tactic to fight impeachment with untruths and power grabs is best illustrated by the key piece of evidence in the case \u2013 the rough White House transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. By boasting that the conversation is \u201cperfect,\u201d Trump is gaslighting Americans about what is in the transcript. Democrats in the impeachment investigation point out that Trump asks Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d after he brings up future purchases of US arms. Trump also asks the Ukrainian President to talk to Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani about investigations into conspiracy theories about Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business in Kiev. Several officials testified to the televised Intelligence Committee hearings that they were troubled by the call and its constitutional implications. But by describing the call as \u201cperfect,\u201d Trump is also implicitly arguing that he is perfectly within his rights as President to pressure a foreign leader for a political favor. Such an interpretation of the role of the presidency suggests that there are few limits to the authority of the office \u2013 and that such behavior is beyond Congress\u2019 power to hold a commander-in-chief to account. \u201cHe has obstructed Congress at every single stage,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cHe has said that Article Two (of the Constitution) gives him the power to do anything he wants. We cannot allow that to happen,\u201d Jayapal told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The White House on Friday blasted the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry as \u201ccompletely baseless\u201d and a \u201creckless abuse of power\u201d ahead of a deadline set by House Democrats for the White House to say whether it would participate in the impeachment proceedings. White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler attacking the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, though the message did not explicitly say that President Donald Trump\u2019s counsel would not take part. \u201cAs you know, your impeachment inquiry is completely baseless and has violated basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness,\u201d Cipollone wrote in a two paragraph letter. \u201cAdopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats, and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan, and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d While the letter letter doesn\u2019t specifically state the White House won\u2019t participate, that\u2019s what it means, according to a senior administration official. \u201cThe letter communicates that we will not participate in this process,\u201d the official said. Nadler responded to the White House\u2019s refusal to participate, saying, \u201cIf the President has no good response to the allegations, then he would not want to appear before the Committee.\u201d \u201cHaving declined this opportunity, he cannot claim that the process is unfair,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe President\u2019s failure will not prevent us from carrying out our solemn constitutional duty.\u201d The White House\u2019s decision removes one potential hurdle to the House voting on articles of impeachment before Christmas. After Monday\u2019s hearing where two committees will present their evidence, the Judiciary panel could debate and approve articles as soon as the end of next week. The White House\u2019s Friday letter was not a big surprise, given that the President\u2019s lawyers already declined to participate in the Judiciary Committee\u2019s first hearing. Cipollone concluded the brief letter by quoting Trump\u2019s tweet from earlier this week: \u201cWhatever course you choose, as the President has recently stated: \u2018if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.\u2019\u201d Cipollone sent the letter after Nadler last week gave the White House a Friday deadline to tell the committee whether Trump\u2019s lawyers would participate in the House impeachment proceedings beyond the first hearing. The House-passed rules for the impeachment proceedings gave the President\u2019s counsel the ability to participate in the Judiciary Committee hearings. The rules state that the President and his counsel were invited to attend committee presentations of the evidence \u2014 which are happening on Monday \u2014 as well as ask questions, raise objections, request witnesses or make a concluding presentation. READ: White House responds to impeachment inquiry deadline \u201cThe American people deserve transparency,\u201d Nadler said after the White House said it would not participate in the first Judiciary Committee hearing. \u201cIf the President thinks the call was \u2018perfect\u2019 and there is nothing to hide then he would turn over the thousands of pages of documents requested by Congress, allow witnesses to testify instead of blocking testimony with baseless privilege claims, and provide any exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.\u201d Republicans have accused Democrats of offering the White House any due process only at the very end of the proceedings, after the bulk of the work was conducted in the House Intelligence Committee where the President\u2019s lawyers could not participate. And they argue the process still isn\u2019t fair, given that Republicans have not gotten to call and equal number of witnesses as the Democrats or a requested hearing with Republican witnesses. While the White House indicated Friday that it wouldn\u2019t take part in the House impeachment proceedings, House Judiciary Republicans formally requested witnesses whom Trump and his allies have been pushing to testify. GOP Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia sent Nadler a letter Friday requesting eight witnesses, including House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, the anonymous whistleblower and anyone the whistleblower relied on to prepare the complaint alleging Trump had solicited election interference from Ukraine. Collins wrote that the committee should call \u201ceach of the witnesses listed above to testify before this Committee to ensure a full evaluation of the facts and to cure the procedural and fairness defects injected into these proceedings by Chairman Schiff.\u201d Collins requested that subpoenas be issued for all of the witnesses they had requested besides Schiff. The other GOP-requested witnesses were Democratic National Committee contractor Alexandra Chalupa, Fusion GPS contractor Nellie Ohr, former Burisma board member Devon Archer and the intelligence community employee whom Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman did not identity during his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Many of these witnesses had also been requested by Republicans during the House Intelligence Committee hearings. Democrats blocked those requests, which Schiff dismissed as an attempt to \u201cundertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.\u201d Also on Friday, the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs committees transmitted the final version of their impeachment report to the Judiciary Committee, according to an aide working on the inquiry, along with a copy of House Republicans\u2019 own report rejecting the Democrats\u2019 allegations. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats are signaling they plan to include evidence gleaned from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation as part of the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. The articles have not been finalized, as talks continue to take shape behind the scenes, with no final decisions having been made. . Whether to include Mueller\u2019s findings of obstruction of justice has been debated internally for weeks as some moderate Democrats only got behind an impeachment inquiry because it was narrowly focused on Ukraine. But in a series of steps the House Judiciary Committee took this week, Democrats are now suggesting that the articles of impeachment could go beyond the scope of the Ukraine investigation that has dominated Washington for the past two months. Moreover, Democratic sources say that Trump\u2019s misconduct in office fits a pattern that extends beyond his dealings with Ukraine, meaning there\u2019s a growing expectation in the House that the articles will showcase a body of evidence of what Democrats believe amount to high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats gave their strongest sign to date they are moving in that direction when they announced the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s next impeachment hearing on Monday. At the hearing, lawmakers will hear presentations of evidence from two committees: Intelligence, which investigated the Ukraine scandal, and Judiciary, which took the lead on investigating the episodes of obstruction of justice detailed in the Mueller report. The committee could move to vote on articles of impeachment later next week. Also, at their first hearing on Wednesday, House Judiciary Democrats intentionally raised the Mueller investigation and asked questions about obstruction of justice on multiple occasions, with Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, noting that Trump\u2019s latest actions showed a \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d seen since his first year in office. And the committee also listed three \u201cimpeachable offenses\u201d on a slide inside the hearing room: abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. Democrats debate whether to include Mueller report in impeachment articles Democratic sources say it\u2019s not an accident that they are reintroducing the Mueller report at this crucial juncture in the impeachment proceedings. If Democrats decide to draft three articles of impeachment, abuse of power is likely to focus mainly on Ukraine, while obstruction of Congress could include the President\u2019s efforts to defy subpoenas before both House Judiciary and Intelligence as well as other committees. An article of impeachment that focuses on obstruction of justice, however, is likely to mainly focus on how Trump allegedly sought to undercut the Mueller probe into his campaign and his presidency. \u201cWhen his own Department of Justice tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records, and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses,\u201d Nadler said at the hearing. At her press conference Thursday after announcing Democrats would be proceeding with articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to get into details about the articles or whether it would include elements of the Mueller report. But she also made a point to allege that the Ukraine scandal was the \u201cvehicle\u201d of Trump\u2019s misconduct. \u201cThis has been a couple of years, two and a half, since the initial investigation of the Russian involvement in America\u2019s election, which started much of this and then led to other things,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cUkraine was the vehicle of the President\u2019s action. \u2026 This isn\u2019t about Ukraine. This is about Russia.\u201d There are potential risks for Democrats to expand the scope of impeachment beyond the allegations that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals while withholding US security aid and a White House meeting. Moderate Democrats, particularly those in Trump-leaning districts, resisted moving forward on an impeachment inquiry throughout much of the year, as liberal Democrats pushed for Congress to take up Mueller\u2019s report to launch an impeachment inquiry. That all changed in September when Pelosi announced a narrow impeachment inquiry to investigate the Ukraine allegations, and nearly every House Democrat publicly backed it. \u201cI was opposed to this previous to Ukraine \u2013 be cognizant of that,\u201d said freshman Rep. Max Rose, a New York Democrat who announced his opposition to an impeachment inquiry but later backed one in the aftermath of the Ukraine scandal, on Thursday. Rose said he would wait to see the articles before deciding if he\u2019d vote to impeach the President. Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia was one of seven freshmen Democrats who jointly announced their support for an impeachment inquiry in the wake of the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Still, she\u2019s said that her focus is on other issues, noting that she held a town hall on prescription drug costs with senior citizens in which no one questioned her about impeachment. Asked whether she thought Trump obstructed justice, Spanberger said \u201cthere is a lot of evidence\u201d that the Judiciary Committee is reviewing. Pelosi on Thursday dismissed the notion she was concerned about her moderates facing blowback for impeachment. \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with politics,\u201d she said. Two Democrats voted against the impeachment inquiry last months: Reps. Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. Van Drew said he plans to vote against all the articles of impeachment \u201cunless there\u2019s something that I haven\u2019t seen, haven\u2019t heard before.\u201d He warned Democrats to \u201cbe careful what you wish for\u201d and he added that impeachment \u201cis tearing the nation apart. \u2026 And I want to bring people together.\u201d Van Drew said he would have preferred a censure vote so they could \u201cmove on.\u201d Asked if he\u2019d vote for impeachment, Peterson said \u201cI don\u2019t have an idea what they\u2019re doing,\u201d before walking onto the House floor. Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, who has not ruled out impeachment, criticized Democrats for the \u201crush to judgment\u201d on impeachment. He said it might be enough for him to oppose impeachment. \u201cI think they would be better serving the American people if they slowed down, fought the privilege, got the first-hand people, do the thorough kind of thing that\u2019s been done before instead of a rush to judgment,\u201d Rooney said. Pelosi said the committee chairs will be \u201cmaking recommendations\u201d on what to include in impeachment articles, although Democratic sources say the ultimate decision will be made in a small, closely held group likely to include Pelosi, Nadler and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California. Pelosi huddled in her office Thursday with the six committee chairs who have been investigating the President all year. \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about that because that is what they will be working on,\u201d Pelosi said when asked about including obstruction of justice charges. Schiff declined to say how he would be involved in the drafting of impeachment articles, telling reporters only that he would be \u201cengaged in the process.\u201d On the House floor, lawmakers are expected to be able to vote on each individual impeachment article, raising the prospect that moderates could vote to impeach Trump based on some articles, but still oppose others. In the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, the House approved two impeachment articles but rejected another two. A simple majority is needed to impeach in the House, where Democrats have a 233-197 advantage. Pelosi's impeachment decision puts her on track for epic clash with Trump As the House\u2019s investigation into Ukraine progressed over the past two months \u2014 which was conducted by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees \u2014 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have been pushing for including Mueller\u2019s charges, too. They\u2019ve argued that not including the obstruction of justice episodes would in effect excuse the President\u2019s behavior toward the special counsel probe. While Pelosi isn\u2019t tipping her hand yet, others in Democratic leadership have suggested Mueller\u2019s charges should be included. \u201cObstruction of justice, I think, is too clear not to include,\u201d House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told McClatchy this week. \u201cThis is not a rush to judgment,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on CNN\u2019s \u2018New Day.\u201d \u201cThis has been a long, thoughtful, careful process from a number of different entities, including Mr. Mueller.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "Democrats pivot from investigating President Donald Trump to beginning their prosecution of him this week in the most significant and historic development yet in a fast-moving impeachment battle. The rising stakes come as Republicans on Sunday launched a new offensive to destroy the legitimacy of the Democratic process by claiming that Trump\u2019s enemies are rushing the somber business of making him the third impeached President in order to dodge a voter backlash. The attack could not, however, disguise a public debate in the GOP over how much Trump should engage in the next stage of impeachment, or whether he should await a likely trial in the Senate where a Republican majority could offer him more protection. The White House said Sunday that neither Trump nor his lawyers would take part in the first House Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment on Wednesday. Democratic leaders built a strong case in two weeks of televised witness hearings before the Thanksgiving break that Trump abused his power by attempting to coerce Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 election. Get smart on impeachment But their efforts have not shifted the nation\u2019s tribal political divisions in a way that could seriously threaten Trump\u2019s presidency and cause Republicans to desert him in the Senate trial expected early next year. The action now moves from Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee, expected to vote to release the report of its investigation on Tuesday, to the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler\u2019s panel will draw up articles of impeachment \u2013 effectively the charges on which Trump would be tried in the Senate \u2013 ahead of a full House vote expected before Christmas. The committee will begin its business on Wednesday with an examination of the constitutional grounds for impeachment for which Nadler is yet to release a witness list. But the chairman offered Trump and his lawyers a chance to join Judiciary Committee proceedings, presenting them with a new tactical conundrum. On Sunday evening, White House counsel Pat Cipollone told Nadler that the President and his lawyers would skip the hearing on Wednesday, and would respond later to a Friday deadline about participation in future hearings. \u201cWe cannot fairly be expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will afford the President a fair process through additional hearings,\u201d Cipollone said. Democratic leaders have already said that Trump\u2019s withholding of nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine allegedly in an attempt to force an investigation of a domestic political opponent \u2013 Joe Biden \u2013 could satisfy the offense of bribery included in the constitutional conditions for impeachment. And the President\u2019s refusal to provide key evidence and senior officials for testimony to the investigation could be folded into a separate article of impeachment on obstruction. Democrats are moving ahead without hearing from central witnesses, including Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani who led his off-the-books diplomatic effort in Ukraine, and former national security adviser John Bolton. The legal challenges likely to be required to force such testimony could drag on for months and frustrate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s desire to shield her lawmakers in election year 2020 by swiftly wrapping the impeachment process. And Democrats also say they already have sufficient evidence to impeach the President. Raising the curtain for critical weeks in the political duel over the Trump presidency, Democrats on Sunday argued that the case against the commander-in-chief already merited impeachment. And Republicans intensified their complaints about the fairness of the process and fanned Trump\u2019s disinformation campaign in a way that reflects their challenge in countering the facts of a case that became even more damning just before Thanksgiving. In the latest blow to Trump\u2019s claims of innocence, The New York Times reported last week that Trump released the hold on aid to Ukraine after he was briefed on a whistleblower\u2019s report raising the alarm at his pressure on the former Soviet state. Republicans previously argued that there was no quid pro quo because Ukraine eventually got the money. But the Times report raises the possibility that the congressionally mandated taxpayer payment was only freed up after Trump got found out. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is running for president, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that she had all but made up her mind over Trump\u2019s fate. \u201cI\u2019m someone that wants to look at every single count,\u201d Klobuchar said, but added: \u201cI have made very clear I think this is impeachable conduct.\u201d California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the only lawmaker to have worked on all three modern impeachments, said Trump\u2019s transgressions were worse than those that led to President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. Only lawmaker to have worked 3 impeachment probes says Trump's Ukraine conduct 'more serious' than Nixon's Watergate \u201cIf you take a look at \u2026 what the founding fathers were concerned about, it was the interference by foreign governments in our political system that was one of their gravest concerns,\u201d Lofgren, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said. \u201cNixon\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t fall into that range.  So, in that way, this conduct is more serious,\u201d Lofgren told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. But Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy complained that the Democratic push for impeachment had been unfair from the start. \u201cRounds one and two by Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff are as rigged as a carnival ring toss,\u201d Kennedy said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an appearance in which he again appeared to draw equivalences between Russian and Ukrainian election meddling. Republicans have alleged that Ukraine interfered in 2016 to give a pretext for Trump\u2019s claim he withheld aid because he wanted to investigate political corruption in Kiev. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, slammed Nadler\u2019s \u201cmade for TV event.\u201d He complained that Republicans were not being given sufficient time to draw up witness lists given that the Intelligence committee would not vote on the Schiff report until Tuesday. He said he didn\u2019t know if the White House would participate, but suggested Republicans want to call Schiff himself as a witness \u2013 a step likely to be resisted by majority Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s an internal kind of time frame to try and finish this out by the end of the year because they want to get at this President right now before \u2026 everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year. So we\u2019re rushing this,\u201d Collins said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Nadler\u2019s invitation to Trump to participate in his future hearings raises a dilemma for the White House \u2013 especially after the President last week blasted Democrats as being \u201cderanged\u201d and \u201cmaniacs\u201d for pursuing an impeachment probe. By refusing to take part, Trump\u2019s team would be weakening their own arguments that Democrats are shutting them out of the process. But joining in would offer legitimacy to an investigation the President has dismissed as a sham and a hoax. Nadler may be effectively laying a trap. If Trump\u2019s lawyers were to argue that his conduct does not reach the bar of impeachment they would implicitly be accepting that the President committed some kind of misconduct. How the last chief justice handled an impeachment trial of the President of the United States Trump has warned Republicans not to make such arguments, insisting his conduct \u2013 including a call with Ukraine\u2019s president that shows him asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d and a probe into Biden and his son Hunter \u2013 is \u201cperfect.\u201d Trump\u2019s position increases political pressure on some Republican senators who are vulnerable in reelection races who might consider criticizing the President to give them political cover for a vote to acquit him. One Republican Judiciary Committee member, California Rep. Tom McClintock, said it would be to the President\u2019s \u201cadvantage\u201d to take part in the panel\u2019s proceedings. But he warned Trump had to weigh \u201cenormous catastrophic damage\u201d that could be done to the concept of executive privilege such a step might entail. A White House official last week cast doubt on the sincerity of Nadler\u2019s offer, pointing out that Trump will be in London for the NATO summit during Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Such debate highlights the challenge facing Nadler, a longtime antagonist of his fellow New Yorker Trump, as his committee takes the lead in driving the impeachment narrative. Nadler\u2019s oversight efforts have so far been less successful in shaping a punchy, damaging case against the administration than Schiff\u2019s public hearings, which were disciplined and powerful and managed to largely neuter GOP efforts to disrupt them. The coming weeks may offer the last best chance for Democrats to significantly alter the political temperature in the nation towards impeachment. No, the new CNN poll is not good news for Donald Trump on impeachment Although 50% of respondents approve of impeaching and removing Trump according to CNN polling, two weeks of televised hearings did not significantly change the equation. The situation reflects the fact that perceptions of Trump\u2019s behavior generally follow partisan lines in a nation deeply polarized by his presidency. It also suggests that while Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to use his constitutional authority to pursue his own interests at the expense of the nation\u2019s appears to be an abuse of power, Ukraine is an issue that is remote for many Americans more concerned with considerations driving the 2020 election, including health care, education and the economy.

            "article_content": "Don McGahn\u2019s name hasn\u2019t been in the news much of late. But a judge\u2019s ruling Monday that the former Trump White House general counsel cannot resist a subpoena to testify from Congress in its ongoing impeachment hearings has wide-ranging implications for a number of senior administration officials tied to the Ukraine probe. \u201cHowever busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires,\u201d Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in her opinion, adding: \u201cStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That ruling is in the process of being appealed and could well end up before the Supreme Court. But in affirming the findings of lower courts, what Jackson did is send a clear signal that executive privilege cannot be claimed overly broadly to keep aides and former aides to speak about potential wrongdoing that they either witnessed or were a part of. It\u2019s in keeping with the argument put forward over the weekend by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (California) regarding decisions by McGahn as well as acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to resist House subpoenas to testify on Ukraine. \u201cBecause we have adduced so much evidence of guilt of this President, so much evidence of serious misconduct, any privilege the President would have would be vitiated by this crime-fraud exception,\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. While Trump allies insist that this fight is far from finished \u2013 and they\u2019re right \u2013 it\u2019s important to understand the psychological (not to mention the legal) impact of this decision on those members of the Trump administration who have continued to refuse to testify. Obviously, if you are McGahn, you have to now prepare yourself for at least the possibility that you will be asked \u2013 under oath \u2013 about your role in the potential obstruction of justice by Trump in Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel probe into Russian obstruction in the 2016 election. (McGahn is requesting a week-long stay so he can appeal the ruling.) But if you are, say Guiliani or Mulvaney, this ruling has to give you pause. Yes, McGahn is a former White House employee while Mulvaney and Giuliani currently work for Trump. (Former national security adviser John Bolton, it\u2019s worth noting, is also a former administration official who has not been subpoenaed, but who House investigators *really* want to talk to.) Giuliani and Mulvaney could possibly hang their hats on the idea that Trump\u2019s broad claim of executive privilege could well apply to them as active employees in a way that courts have ruled it doesn\u2019t apply to McGahn. Maybe! But that line of reasoning took a hit on Monday \u2013 and will force anyone with an outstanding subpoena from Congress to reconsider their position at least somewhat in the coming days. \u201cI would actually like people to testify,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \u201cDon McGahn\u2019s respected lawyer has already stated that I did nothing wrong.\u201d  Added Trump: \u201cI would love to have Mike Pompeo, Rick Perry, Mick Mulvaney and many others testify about the phony Impeachment Hoax. \u201c One other ripple from the McGahn decision is this: Schiff now faces a tougher choice in whether to wait out some of these bigger-fish witnesses or move the impeachment process to the Judiciary Committee for the presumed writing of articles of impeachment against Trump. \u201cYes, we\u2019d love to have these witnesses come in, but we\u2019re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out to stall this proceeding, when the facts are already overwhelming,\u201d Schiff told Tapper on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue our investigation. We are going to continue to pursue the documents.\u201d Monday\u2019s ruling seemingly speeds up the timeline on the so-called \u201cstalling\u201d considerably. If McGahn is compelled to testify, there\u2019s a precedent that would make it very difficult for Bolton to avoid testifying. And if McGahn and Bolton testify, suddenly the possibility of Mulvaney or even Giuliani testifying seems a whole lot more real.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge decided Monday that President Donald Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify to the House of Representatives in its impeachment probe, marking the first major ruling about House witness testimony during the Trump administration. \u201cHowever busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires,\u201d Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote. \u201cStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,\u201d Jackson said. The ruling is a blow to Trump and White House efforts to block parts of the impeachment inquiry. It could encourage resistant witnesses from the administration to testify and could bolster any case House Democrats make to impeach the President for obstructing its proceedings or obstructing justice. The Justice Department has filed paperwork to appeal the judge\u2019s opinion, and McGahn\u2019s testimony may be put on hold during the appeals. The department also asked Jackson to pause her ruling pending appeal. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement that it will be up to the witnesses who have defied the committee\u2019s demands to change course if they want to testify. \u201cThe witnesses who have defied Congress at the behest of the President will have to decide whether their duty is to the country, or to a President who believes that he is above the law,\u201d the California Democrat said. READ: Judge rules in Don McGahn subpoena lawsuit Jackson\u2019s opinion Monday is some of the strongest wording yet criticizing the White House\u2019s approach to investigations into Trump. It represents a flex of muscle from the judicial branch, which has largely been used for delays as the House and White House clash over the probe. The ruling blasts the Trump White House and Justice Department in the judge\u2019s own words, but her reasoning largely rests upon decisions made by previous judges, including a district judge who said George W. Bush White House officials had to testify to Congress. Still, appeals could take weeks if not months to resolve, if the matter ultimately heads to the Supreme Court. Federal appeals courts and the Supreme Court haven\u2019t yet firmly resolved questions about executive branch witness testimony before Congress. The Justice Department plans to appeal the ruling in the McGahn case, a department spokeswoman said Monday. \u201cDon McGahn will comply with Judge Jackson\u2019s decision unless it is stayed pending appeal,\u201d McGahn\u2019s private attorney, William Burck, said Monday following the ruling. In this case, McGahn is represented by the Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee has been trying to force McGahn to testify since April about the President\u2019s attempts to obstruct the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The committee says it still has an urgent need to hear from the key witnesses from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Jackson criticized the Justice Department\u2019s broad claims of immunity. \u201cTo make the point as plain as possible \u2026 with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIndeed,\u201d she added, \u201cabsolute testimonial immunity for senior-level White House aides appears to be a fiction that has been fastidiously maintained over time through the force of sheer repetition in (Office of Legal Counsel) opinions, and through accommodations that have permitted its proponents to avoid having the proposition tested in the crucible of litigation.\u201d Jackson also attacked the White House\u2019s assertion that it could block its former officials \u2013 not just current employees \u2013 from testifying. Though the administration has tried to use immunity as a \u201ctrump card,\u201d she wrote, it \u201cshould, at most, be a raincheck, and not the lifetime pass that DOJ proposes.\u201d The ruling stops short of saying White House officials must answer all questions they\u2019re asked before Congress. Instead, the ruling focuses on whether an official like McGahn must appear for testimony once subpoenaed. \u201cIf a duly authorized committee of Congress issues a valid legislative subpoena to a current or former senior-level presidential aide, the law requires the aide to appear as directed, and assert executive privilege as appropriate,\u201d the judge wrote in the 120-page opinion Monday. If McGahn were to appear for testimony, he still may be able to refuse to answer questions, citing executive privilege. Jackson referred to a case involving Bush\u2019s White House counsel Harriet Miers. \u201cAccordingly, just as with Harriet Miers before him, Donald McGahn \u2018must appear before the Committee to provide testimony, and invoke executive privilege where appropriate,\u2019 \u201d Jackson wrote. The judge, in this ruling, makes clear that the House should have subpoena power over other top administration officials, even outside of McGahn\u2019s situation. Other top officials, such as former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, have separately gone to court for guidance on whether they are immune from testimony or must comply with impeachment-related subpoenas. Kupperman continues to fight his case, and is not bound by this decision. Still, Jackson notes in her opinion Monday that even the President himself may not be immune from testimony. \u201cEven with respect to the underlying contention that the President himself is entitled to absolute testimonial immunity, Miers found binding Supreme Court cases that compelled the opposite conclusion,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cA President\u2019s confidentiality interests may sometimes be overridden over his objection,\u201d she added in a footnote. \u201cIt seems unlikely that a President would be declared absolutely immune from compelled congressional process.\u201d This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-California), fresh off the biggest week of his tenure in Congress, sat for an extended interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Schiff talked about the week that was \u2013 three days of public impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct in and around the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy \u2013 in personal and telling terms. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! I went through the transcript and pulled out the most important moments. They\u2019re here. 1) US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s admission that there was a quid pro quo \u2013 Zelensky would get his White House meeting when he publicly announced an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. 2) Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony that she had come to believe that American foreign policy and national security interests had been co-opted by Trump\u2019s personal and political interests. 3) David Holmes, a diplomatic staffer in Ukraine, testifying to a conversation he had with Sondland on July 26 in which the ambassador made clear that Trump was only interested in \u201cbig\u201d things in Ukraine \u2013 like investigating the Bidens. Asked by Tapper whether any witness had directly linked Trump to the holdup in nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for an investigation announcement, Schiff named acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. (Mulvaney has resisted a subpoena to appear in the impeachment proceedings.) \u201cThe President\u2019s own chief of staff, the person who meets with the President every day, on live camera admitted exactly that vis-a-vis the most serious, and that is the military aid,\u201d said Schiff. Mulvaney, in a hugely problematic news conference last month, said \u201cthat\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d when asked about Trump\u2019s desire of Ukraine to investigate corruption. \u201cGet over it,\u201d he told the assembled reporters. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d Schiff\u2019s committee has heard from lots of witnesses in the course of its closed-door and public impeachment proceedings. But with the exception of Sondland, the people who sit at the center of the controversy \u2013 Trump\u2019s personal layer Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former national security adviser John Bolton \u2013 have fought attempts to bring them in. Some observers believe Schiff should wait until he can get some (or all) of these witnesses \u2013 in order to make the impeachment case airtight. Schiff won\u2019t be doing that. \u201cYes, we\u2019d love to have these witnesses come in, but we\u2019re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out to stall this proceeding, when the facts are already overwhelming,\u201d he told Tapper. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue our investigation. We are going to continue to pursue the documents.\u201d Republicans \u2013 and even some Democrats \u2013 are raising questions as to why (and whether) the impeachment investigation needs to be finished and articles of impeachment voted on before the end of the year. The reasoning for that rush is widely attributed to Democratic worries about the impeachment debate leeching into an election year \u2013 and possibly helping Trump by allowing him to make the case that Democrats are so fixated on impeachment that they aren\u2019t getting anything done for the American people. Schiff on Sunday tried out a new message on timing. \u201cThere is a sense of urgency, when you have a President who\u2019s threatening the integrity of our elections, that we need to act now, if we\u2019re going to act, and we can\u2019t allow this obstruction to succeed,\u201d he said. Schiff laid down a marker when it comes to the pending (and likely) legal fight over whether conversations between Trump and Pompeo or Trump and Mulvaney or Trump and Giuliani are protected by executive privilege. \u201cBecause we have adduced so much evidence of guilt of this President, so much evidence of serious misconduct, any privilege the President would have would be vitiated by this crime-fraud exception,\u201d he said. In simpler terms: If there is clear evidence of wrongdoing or misconduct already proven, the President will not be able to hide behind privilege claims. Trump has already made clear that in a Senate trial, where his side can call witnesses, he would aim to force Schiff to testify \u2013 noting that David Kendall, Bill Clinton\u2019s lawyer during the last Senate impeachment trial, was able to cross-examine independent counsel Ken Starr. Apples and oranges, according to Schiff. \u201cI\u2019m not a special counsel,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t work for a separate branch of government. I\u2019m not in the Justice Department. I am more in a position that Henry Hyde was during the Clinton impeachment, or Peter Rodino during the Nixon impeachment, or Sam Ervin. They were not fact witnesses.\u201d Asked about what it would mean if Republicans uniformly opposed any articles of impeachment against Trump, Schiff cast the vote as a matter of conscience \u2013 and history. \u201cIt will have very long-term consequences, if that\u2019s where we end up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if not today, I think Republican members in the future, to their children and their grandchildren, will have to explain why they did nothing in the face of this deeply unethical man who did such damage to the country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment investigation held its third day of public hearings \u2013 featuring National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, a member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff. The afternoon hearing featured former US Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison, the former top Russia and Europe adviser on President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Council. I watched the hearings and took notes \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to! Below, the biggest moments from the hearing, as they happened. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Even before Vindman or Williams had said a word, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (California) sought to warn his Republican colleagues against attacking either of the witnesses. Of Vindman, who received a Purple Heart after being wounded by an IED in Iraq, Schiff said: \u201cWe have seen far more scurrilous attacks on your character, and watched as certain personalities on Fox have questioned your loyalty. I note that you have shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude.\u201d Noting that Trump had attacked both Williams and Vindman, Schiff later added, \u201cI hope no one on this committee will become part of those vicious attacks.\u201d Will Schiff\u2019s warning change how Republicans will handle Vindman and Williams? Probably not. But it makes clear that Democrats will not let any attacks on either witness simply pass. Listening to the opening statement of Rep. Devin Nunes (California), you\u2019d be forgiven if you thought that Tuesday\u2019s hearing was an examination of the national media and its role in politics and policy. Nunes claimed that the media was responsible for, among other things, pushing the idea that Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with the Russians (the Department of Justice decided to open the investigation, not the media) and working with Democrats to drum up controversy surrounding Ukraine (the witnesses called so far in the impeachment investigation have been members of the Trump administration.) Nunes also used his opening statement to defend a series of columns written by John Solomon, a former columnist for The Hill newspaper, raising questions about the conduct of Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine. \u201cNow that Solomon\u2019s reporting is a problem for the Democrats, it\u2019s a problem for the media as well,\u201d said Nunes. (The Hill is in the midst of an investigation into Solomon\u2019s columns.) How much did Nunes actually talk about the facts of the Ukraine investigation or the witness testimony we were going to hear? Uh, not much. Vindman\u2019s personal story \u2013 brought with his twin brother to the United States from Russia at age 3, decorated military service, years of work as a Ukraine expert \u2013 is compelling to read on a piece of paper. It was that much more compelling to hear him relate his life journey in his opening statement while wearing the uniform of the US Army. Vindman\u2019s closing lines were particularly powerful: \u201cI am grateful for my father\u2019s brave act of hope 40 years ago and for the privilege of being an American citizen and public servant, where I can live free of fear for mine and my family\u2019s safety. \u201cDad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision forty years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d You will be seeing and hearing that last line \u2013 \u201cI will be fine for telling the truth\u201d \u2013 a whole lot today and in the days to come. Vindman didn\u2019t mince words when asked why he immediately reported to his superiors his discomfort with Trump\u2019s actions on the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he was previously aware of an \u201calternative false narrative\u201d prior to the call. Pushed on whether those \u201cfalse narratives\u201d were the ideas that a) Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election to aid Hillary Clinton and b) the Ukrainians had not adequately looked into allegations that Joe and Hunter Biden had committed some wrongdoing regarding Ukraine, Vindman confirmed that they were. Neither of those claims, which Trump relayed in his July 25 call with Zelensky, have any basis in known facts. During the Republican counsel\u2019s questioning of Vindman, it came up that he had been asked, on three occasions, by the Ukrainians to serve as their defense minister. (Vindman was born in Ukraine but came to the United States when he was 3.) \u201cI\u2019m an American,\u201d Vindman responded, noting that he had turned down the offers. \u201cI came here when I was a toddler, and I immediately dismissed these offers. I did not entertain them.\u201d He added that he had \u201cnotified my chain of command and the appropriate counterintelligence folks about the offer.\u201d Later, Connecticut Democratic Rep. Jim Himes ripped Republicans for trying to inject the issue into the hearings. Himes said it was a clear effort to question Vindman\u2019s commitment to America and part of a broader attempt by conservatives to suggest he had dual loyalties of some sort. (Later, President Trump retweeted a tweet by an aide \u2013 Dan Scavino \u2013 noting the three offers made to Vindman.) \u201cI want people to understand what that was all about,\u201d said Himes of the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing you say when you have to defend the indefensible.\u201d Twice \u2013 once by Nunes and once by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan \u2013 Republicans on the committee sought to force VIndman to disclose the two people outside of the National Security Council who he briefed on the July 25 call. One, Vindman said, was George Kent, the State Department official who testified last week. The other, Vindman said, was a member of the intelligence community. When pressed to say who that second person was, Vindman demurred \u2013 citing guidance provided by Schiff that the committee would not be involved in the business of outing the whistleblower. Nunes and Jordan objected strenuously, noting that Vindman had said he didn\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower so how could he possibly out him or her? Jordan took it a step further by making clear that he didn\u2019t believe Schiff\u2019s assertion that the California Democrat didn\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower. Around and around they went \u2013 to no resolution. Vindman didn\u2019t say who the second person was, and Jordan and Nunes remained annoyed. Vindman showed relatively little emotion after the first moments of the hearing, when his hands were visibly shaking as he read his opening statement. But he did let his annoyance slip once \u2013 when Nunes referred to him as \u201cMr. Vindman\u201d in asking a question. \u201cIt\u2019s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,\u201d he replied. Trump seized on that moment when talking to reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know him,\u201d Trump said of Vindman. \u201cI don\u2019t know, as he says, \u2018Lieutenant Colonel.\u2019 I understand somebody had the misfortune of calling him \u2018Mr.\u2019 and he corrected them. I never saw the man. I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in. No, I don\u2019t know Vindman at all.\u201d How does this play? My guess is that depends which party you side with. Democrats will see Vindman\u2019s \u201clieutenant colonel\u201d correction as a smackdown of the much-maligned Nunes. Republicans will view it as evidence that Vindman is just an egotistical bureaucrat who doesn\u2019t like Nunes and, by extension, Republicans. As the hearing wound to a close, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-New York) asked Vindman whether his father was a \u201cworrier\u201d and whether he or his father are concerned about the decision to come forward with testimony that put him on the opposite side of the President of the United States. Vindman said that his father was very worried because he came from the Soviet Union, where the consequences for such an action could be severe. Vindman added that he wasn\u2019t worried himself because \u201cThis is America. This is the country I\u2019ve served and defended. That all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\u201d Some members of the audience applauded him for that sentiment. Volker recounted a meeting in May in the Oval Office in which he and others argued to Trump that he should work to build a relationship with the newly elected Zelensky. Volker told the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday afternoon that Trump was not receptive to those urgings. \u201cHe said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible people,\u201d recounted Volker. \u201cHe said, \u2018They tried to take me down.\u2019\u201d Volker said that he became convinced that Trump\u2019s obstinacy was rooted in what he was being told by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Said Volker: \u201cIt was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation about the new President, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view.\u201d Volker dismissed Trump\u2019s belief that Joe Biden was somehow trying to protect his son in Ukraine or that the country possessed the hacked Democratic National Committee server as \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d Volker, who was a witness Republicans had pushed for, offered very different testimony on Tuesday than he did when he spoke behind closed doors with House impeachment investigators. \u201cSince these events, and since I gave my testimony on October 3, a great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light,\u201d Volker told the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cI have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question.\u201d Among the changes: *Volker initially said that investigations into Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories and the release of almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine were not mentioned in a July 10 meeting at the White House. But on Tuesday, Volker said he now knows that the investigations were mentioned. *Volker said in his October testimony that any conversations with the Ukrainians about making an announcement on the opening of an investigation into the Bidens had ended in August. But on Tuesday, Volker acknowledged that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had told a top Ukrainian official on September 1 that he believed the military aid was tied to the announcement of an investigation. Those are both big deals \u2013 and undermine the very points Republicans were hoping Volker would make in the public hearings. Morrison, the former top NSC Russia and Europe adviser, broke some news when he said that he had been told by NSC lawyer John Eisenberg that the transcript of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky had been placed in a more secure server solely because of a \u201cmistake\u201d by the lawyer\u2019s executive secretary. \u201cJohn related that he did not ask for it to be put on there, but that the Executive Secretariat staff misunderstood his recommendation for how to restrict access,\u201d Morrison told the committee. That directly counters what Vindman told the Intelligence Committee earlier today. Here\u2019s the exchange between Vindman and Democratic counsel Dan Goldman: GOLDMAN: Was it intended to be put on the highly classified system by the lawyers or was it a mistake that it was put there? VINDMAN: I think it was intended. But, again, it was intended to prevent leaks and to limit access. Morrison was asked later about the specific instructions given surrounding where the transcript should be placed. He made clear that he was in favor of limiting the number of people with access to it but that he did not specifically request it be put on the server where it ultimately wound up.",

            "article_content": "As prepared for delivery: Thank you, Chairman Schiff, Ranking Member Nunes, and other Members of the Committee for the opportunity to provide this statement. I appear today pursuant to a subpoena and am prepared to answer your questions to the best of my abilities. I have had the privilege of serving as a Foreign Service Officer for nearly fourteen years, working for three different presidential administrations\u2014two Republican and one Democratic. I joined the State Department in 2006 after serving in the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Michael Chertoff. It was with great pride and conviction that I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, administered by a personal hero of mine, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As a career officer, I am committed to serving the American people and advancing American interests abroad, in support of the President\u2019s foreign policy objectives. I have been inspired and encouraged in that journey by the thousands of other dedicated public servants whom I am proud to call colleagues across the Foreign Service, civil service, military, and federal law enforcement agencies. I have served overseas tours in Kingston, Jamaica; Beirut, Lebanon; and London, United Kingdom. I have worked to implement humanitarian assistance programs to millions of victims of the Syria conflict, and served as an advisor on Middle East issues to the Deputy Secretary of State. And this spring, it was the greatest honor of my career to be asked to serve as a Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia. Over the past eight months, I have been privileged to work with the dedicated and capable men and women in the Office of the Vice President to advance the Administration\u2019s agenda. I have also worked closely with talented and committed colleagues at the National Security Council (\u201cNSC\u201d), State Department, Department of Defense, and other agencies to advance and promote U.S. foreign policy objectives. In this capacity, I have advised and prepared the Vice President for engagements related to Ukraine. As you are aware, on November 7th, I appeared before the Committee for a closed-door deposition pursuant to a subpoena. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly summarize my recollection of some of the events I expect the Committee may ask me about. President Zelensky\u2019s Inauguration On April 21st, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidential election. On April 23rd, the Vice President called to congratulate President-elect Zelensky. During the call, which I participated in, the Vice President accepted an invitation to attend President-elect Zelensky\u2019s upcoming inauguration, provided that the scheduling worked out. The Vice President had only a narrow window of availability at the end of May, and the Ukrainian parliament would not meet to set a date for the inauguration until after May 14th. As a result, we did not expect to know whether the Vice President could attend until May 14th at the earliest, and we made only preliminary trip preparations in early May. On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President\u2019s Chief of Staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in Ukraine. She did not provide any further explanation. I relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice President would not be attending, so that it could identify a head of delegation to represent the United States at President-elect Zelensky\u2019s inauguration. Hold on Ukraine Security Assistance On July 3rd, I learned that the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) had placed a hold on a tranche of security assistance designated for Ukraine. According to the information I received, OMB was reviewing whether the funding was aligned with the Administration\u2019s priorities. I subsequently attended meetings of the Policy Coordination Committee where the hold on Ukrainian security assistance was discussed. During those meetings, representatives of the State and Defense Departments advocated that the hold should be lifted, and OMB representatives reported that the White House Chief of Staff had directed that the hold should remain in place. On September 11th, I learned that the hold on security assistance for Ukraine had been released. I have never learned what prompted that decision. July 25th Call Between President Trump and President Zelensky On July 25th, along with several of my colleagues, I listened to a call between President Trump and President Zelensky\u2014the content of which has since been publicly reported. Prior to July 25th, I had participated in roughly a dozen other presidential phone calls. During my closed-door deposition, Members of the Committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter. After the July 25th call, I provided an update in the Vice President\u2019s daily briefing book indicating that President Trump had a call that day with President Zelensky. A hard copy of the memorandum transcribing the call was also included in the book. I do not know whether the Vice President reviewed my update or the transcript. I did not discuss the July 25th call with the Vice President or any of my colleagues in the Office of the Vice President or the NSC. September 1 Meeting Between the Vice President and President Zelensky On August 29th, I learned that the Vice President would be traveling to Poland to meet with President Zelensky on September 1st. At the September 1st meeting, which I attended, President Zelensky asked the Vice President about news articles reporting a hold on U.S. security assistance for Ukraine. The Vice President responded that Ukraine had the United States\u2019 unwavering support and promised to relay their conversation to President Trump that night. During the September 1st meeting, neither the Vice President nor President Zelensky mentioned the specific investigations discussed during the July 25th call. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this statement. I would be happy to answer any questions.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Editor\u2019s note: This story first published October 29 ahead of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman\u2019s closed-door deposition. It has been updated with additional developments since his initial testimony. The White House\u2019s top Ukraine expert \u2013 who expressed concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukraine President \u2013 is set to appear on Tuesday before a committee leading the House impeachment inquiry as House Democrats continue to take their case to the public. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated veteran who was born in Ukraine, told the House Intelligence Committee last month during a more than 10-hour closed-door deposition that he reported concerns about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine to the top National Security Council lawyer within hours, and said some of the changes he tried to make to the since-published transcript were left out, though he didn\u2019t say why. Vindman also told lawmakers that later, he was told not to discuss the call with anyone else. His public hearing this week is part of a growing list of hearings the panel is holding with current and former administration officials who are tied to the matters Democrats are probing. Many of the public hearings feature individuals who have already testified before the committee, but the new, televised interviews will give Democrats a chance to bring their investigation to life as they attempt to present to the public a compelling case for the President\u2019s impeachment. Vindman, whose testimony will occur on the same day that three other witnesses appear before the committee, was the first person to testify before the committee who was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During his October 29 deposition, he told the panel that one example of his attempts to change the transcript was to include Trump telling Zelensky there were tapes of former Vice President Joe Biden, which The New York Times has reported occurred where there\u2019s an ellipsis in the transcript that was released by the White House. The change was not made. Vindman also testified that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told Ukrainian officials in meetings on July 10 they would have to open an investigation to secure a White House meeting, adding to a growing body of evidence that the push for Ukraine to investigate the 2016 election and Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company that hired Biden\u2019s son, was conditioned on a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Zelensky and the release of $400 million in US security aid that was frozen by the White House. \u201cOn the 10th of July \u2026 it became completely apparent what the deliverable would be in order to get a White House meeting. That deliverable was reinforced by the President,\u201d Vindman told lawmakers in his deposition last month. \u201cThe demand was, in order to get the White House meeting, they had to deliver an investigation. That became clear as time progressed from how this thing unfolded through the 10th all the way through the conclusion.\u201d On Tuesday, Vindman\u2019s identical twin brother, Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, a National Security Council lawyer who handles ethics issues, is expected to attend his testimony, according to a person familiar with the matter. Last month, Vindman faced attacks by Trump and Republicans, who were seeking to discredit the aide ahead of his potentially-damaging testimony. In a tweet on the morning of his testimony, Trump alleged that Vindman and others who have testified about him as part of the impeachment inquiry are \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d though there is little evidence Vindman is a political opponent of Trump\u2019s. Since appearing before the committee, Vindman has remained in his post with the NSC, and he has no intention of leaving it, officials familiar with the matter have said. The White House aide told Congress in his opening statement that he has \u201cserved this country in a nonpartisan manner \u2026 with the utmost respect and professionalism for both the Republican and Democratic administrations.\u201d He noted that he has \u201cnever had direct contact or communications\u201d with Trump. Vindman also said in his statement that he has been a Foreign Area Office specializing in Eurasia since 2008 and that he has worked the US\u2019 embassies in Ukraine and Russia as part of that job. He also worked for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, serving as a politico-military affairs officer for Russia. According to his prepared remarks, Vindman \u2014 who was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in Iraq after being wounded in an IED attack and still carries shrapnel from the attack in his body, according to a source close to him  \u2014 told the House committee members how his family fled to the US from the Soviet Union when he was a child. \u201cThe privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in my military service, but also in my personal history. I sit here, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, an immigrant,\u201d he will say, according to his remarks. \u201cMy family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old. Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night. He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country.\u201d Vindman served multiple overseas tours, including in South Korea and Germany in addition to his deployment to Iraq, according to his prepared remarks. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. These three things have now happened: It\u2019s a coincidence to make your head spin. On the same day Trump teases that he might testify before the impeachment inquiry, House Democrats make clear they are investigating Trump for lying to Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Trump teased testimony for Mueller too. Remember, there was a long tease as to whether Trump would submit to an actual deposition with Mueller. It was not unlike what he started doing today with Pelosi. But ultimately he answered questions in writing. What\u2019s this investigation, again? This is quite separate from the impeachment inquiry, but they could ultimately fuse together. This is an investigation by House Democrats into whether Trump obstructed the Russia investigation. They said at a court hearing Monday that they want to determine if Trump was telling the truth when he said he couldn\u2019t recall discussing WikiLeaks with Roger Stone, his friend and informal political adviser, who was convicted on Friday of lying to Congress. What did Trump tell Mueller? Trump told Mueller, in writing, that he had no recollection of talking to Stone about WikiLeaks. What did Gates and Manafort tell Mueller? That could be at odds with testimony by his former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, who testified that Trump and Stone did discuss WikiLeaks when Stone was attempting to get secret details about stolen Democratic documents WikiLeaks had. Gates\u2019 former boss, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, also seems to have told the Mueller grand jury what Trump\u2019s approach to WikiLeaks had been in 2016, according to the Mueller report. But the material was redacted in the released Mueller report by the Justice Department. And Congress wants to see it. Which is why it\u2019s in court. We keep learning new things about the Mueller investigation In fact, we learned a lot about Mueller\u2019s investigation from testimony in the Stone trial. Here\u2019s a list of tidbits compiled by CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen and Katelyn Polantz, including that the 10% of the report the Justice Department redacted includes some very important material. In terms of Stone\u2019s cooperation with WikiLeaks, the contacts between Trump aides and Russia, and now his pressure on Ukraine, you certainly can see a clear pattern in how elections are viewed in Trump\u2019s orbit. The differences between Mueller\u2019s methodical by-the-books investigation and its subsequent report could not be more different from the impeachment inquiry. Mueller tried to avoid the appearance of a political motivation at all costs. Democrats are essentially embracing it. Mueller conducted a thorough, methodical and secret investigation. Details would seep out as he filed criminal charges or announced plea deals with former Trump aides, but the main thrust and his conclusions were hidden from view. An investigation in public and in real time The impeachment probe is being conducted in real time and, despite Republican complaints to the contrary, in full view. Democrats are pushing an aggressive timeline to get impeachment done. They\u2019re cramming witnesses onto panels for public hearings. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d compared it to a soap opera, but it\u2019s really more of a reality TV show. The American public is learning about new leads at the same time as impeachment investigators. At the end, there won\u2019t be a report for the Department of Justice to review and redact, but rather articles of impeachment for lawmakers to approve or oppose. I guest-hosted the Impeachment Watch podcast today and Alex Marquardt and I spent a lot of time asking Michael Zeldin, who has been a defense attorney and worked at the Justice Department, about truth and lies in congressional testimony. What would it actually mean if Trump lied to Mueller and what would happen as a result? Even if the Department of Justice didn\u2019t have a policy of not indicting a president, perjury in a case like this would be really hard to prove in a court of law. Zeldin pointed out Trump has a lot of wiggle room in the way he answered questions for Mueller. He said he didn\u2019t recall rather than that he did not discuss WikiLeaks, for instance. The President can always have his memory jogged, ala Gordon Sondland, who now remembers giving a sort of ultimatum about military aid to Ukrainians. It will be interesting to see if Sondland\u2019s memory is further jogged when he testifies in public on Wednesday now that there\u2019s testimony from a State Department staffer at the US Embassy in Ukraine that Sondland had talked on the phone to Trump about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and investigations while eating with staffers at a restaurant in Ukraine. Will he now remember that? House impeachment investigators released the closed-door deposition transcripts of David Holmes, the political adviser at the US Embassy in Ukraine, and senior State Department official David Hale ahead of three days of public testimony with nine officials appearing, including Holmes and Hale. Holmes, who says he overheard the call that Sondland placed to Trump at the restaurant in Kiev, testified, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown and Kevin Liptak report that Trump aides have explored moving some impeachment witnesses who are on loan to the White House from other agencies, such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, back to their home departments ahead of schedule, according to people familiar with the conversations. With these bureaucrats taking center stage on his television screen, Trump is asking anew how witnesses such as Vindman and Bill Taylor came to work for him, according to people familiar with the matter. He has suggested again that they be dismissed, even as advisers warn him that firing them could be viewed as retaliation \u2013 a no-no. Set to testify: CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reports that during Vindman\u2019s closed deposition last month, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, objected to a line of questioning that he believed was part of a GOP effort to out the whistleblower as Republicans were asking who Vindman had spoken to. CNN asked Rep. Jim Jordan if the Republicans would go that route again, and he indicated it hadn\u2019t been decided yet. \u201cWe are working on what we are going to ask,\u201d the Ohio Republican told CNN. \u201cMr Vindman has been subpoenaed by Congress. That means members of Congress should get to ask the questions they want. Adam Schiff doesn\u2019t just get to ask the questions he wants.\u201d Jordan added: \u201cWhether that comes up tomorrow or not \u2014 we are still talking about the sequencing of questions and what those questions will be.\u201d We will hear Tuesday from Tim Morrison, who replaced Fiona Hill on the National Security Council and will testify alongside Volker. Morrison said John Bolton had a private meeting with Trump in August about the Ukraine aid. Read Morrison\u2019s closed-door testimony. It\u2019s still not clear when or if Bolton himself will testify, even as it becomes more apparent that he could be a key figure in the story since he may have tried to subvert Trump\u2019s shadow foreign policy in favor of the direct and official one. Bolton wants a court to tell him whether he should respect Trump\u2019s executive privilege or a House request that he testify. Bolton was not subpoenaed as part of the impeachment probe since Democrats have suggested they don\u2019t want to engage in time-consuming court fights to compel testimony from unwilling officials. CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler reports from Foggy Bottom that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to specifically lend his public support to former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and to Bill Taylor, who\u2019s now the top diplomat in Ukraine, instead voicing support for the Trump administration\u2019s Ukraine policy and again erroneously accusing the Obama administration of allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to annex Crimea. Pressed again, Pompeo voiced support for the State Department writ large, saying, \u201cI always defend State Department employees. It\u2019s the greatest diplomatic corps in the history of the world. Very proud of the team.\u201d Doesn\u2019t have anything to say \u201cDo you agree with the President\u2019s tweet on Yovanovitch?\u201d he was asked.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment angst led him to fire off a new attack on a key witness and threatens to deepen in the frenetic week ahead with crucial testimony scheduled from officials caught in the middle of the Ukraine storm. But as is perpetually the case with the President, a brew of competing scandals and controversies will jostle for attention in Washington. That includes fallout from a mysterious and unscheduled trip to a hospital on Saturday, his fight against efforts to reveal his tax records and an apparent new tactic \u2013 firing off searing attacks on witnesses who criticize him in televised hearings. The President opened a window into the state of his mind Sunday when he lashed out against Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, who described his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in her deposition as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d An appearance on Wednesday from Gordon Sondland, the US envoy to the European Union, could prove to be the most pivotal moment so far of the inquiry into whether Trump abused his power. The former GOP donor is emerging as Trump\u2019s top point of contact with Ukranian officials as the President pushed for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a possible 2020 rival. Other witnesses have testified that Sondland had a direct line to the President and as saying that the only thing Trump cared about in relations with Ukraine was his own political advantage. That leaves Sondland facing a dilemma \u2013 does he seek to protect the President when he testifies under oath or can he mitigate his own exposure? He may not be able to do both. But Sondland is not the only witness with the capacity to damage the President\u2019s case this week. At least eight current and former officials are expected to testify in a dramatic week of televised hearings that are likely to infuriate Trump and may tie him more directly to the scheme to go around official US foreign policy channels to heap pressure on Ukraine. Trump lashes out at State Department employee ahead of public testimony Trump blasted Williams in a tweet as part of a band of \u201cNever Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of.\u201d Pence\u2019s office pointedly declined to defend Williams \u2013 with a spokeswoman apparently seeking to downplay her importance to the vice president by saying she was a staffer on assignment from the State Department. The President\u2019s attack may be an attempt to discredit public testimony from Williams due on Tuesday when she is scheduled to appear alongside Lt. Col.  Alexander Vindman, a senior National Security Council official who has also criticized Trump. Trump\u2019s assault follows his attack on former US ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony at a televised hearing on Friday in a tweet that sparked a debate over whether he was guilty of witness tampering \u2013 with some Democrats suggesting the episode could be folded into articles of impeachment. The building sense of crisis was reflected in comments by one of the President\u2019s top Republican defenders, Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio on Sunday. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said from the beginning, this is not OK,\u201d Turner told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThe President of the United States shouldn\u2019t even in the original phone call be on the phone with the president of another country and raise his political opponent.\u201d Still, Turner argued that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d or smoking gun that should lead to the President being removed from office. His comments reflect the uncomfortable spot Republicans find themselves facing as more and more evidence contradicts the White House claim that nothing underhand took place. Republican congressman calls new details about Trump revealed in impeachment testimony 'alarming' Trump has already warned his party not to adopt a face-saving approach in which lawmakers could criticize his behavior but argue that it does not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. There is so far no sign of Trump\u2019s Republican firewall crumbling in the Democratic-led House \u2013 which is expected to vote to impeach before the end of the year, or the Senate where a two-thirds majority would be needed to convict him and oust him from office after an impeachment trial. Wall Street Journal: Sondland kept Trump administration officials briefed on Ukraine dealings But the political price that Republicans may pay for saving the President \u2013 especially among vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection next year appears to be rising. According to a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa, members of both parties in the state see the inquiry as a boost to their party\u2019s chances of winning the general election next November. Trump\u2019s defense was further undermined by the latest witness testimony released over the weekend that appeared to show him more closely tied to the center of the scheme to pressure Ukraine. This followed a grim week in which several State Department veterans painted a picture of a rogue operation that trashed longtime US national interests to serve Trump\u2019s political goals. Roger Stone, the President\u2019s friend, was meanwhile convicted of lying to Congress, apparently in an effort to protect the President from embarrassment in a case linked to then-special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. And an unscheduled visit by the President to Walter Reed on Saturday sparked new intrigue and doubts over whether his staff was being truthful about his condition. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said the President was in good health and went for a routine check-up. An emerging line of defense for the President is that anyone critical of his conduct is simply a disaffected bureaucrat who never accepted him as President. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise suggested on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that people criticizing the President were witnesses chosen by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to make Trump look bad. \u201cThere are a lot of people who worked in the Trump administration who have very countering views to that and they\u2019ve not been allowed to come forward,\u201d Scalise said. And Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said the investigative process threatens executive privilege in the future, arguing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday that a public examination of the President\u2019s actions is damaging to the country. \u201cHaving this all come out into public \u2026 has exposed things that didn\u2019t need to be exposed,\u201d Johnson said. But while the White House is targeting foreign service and current and former National Security Council staff who have testified, Trump has not allowed senior political staff \u2013 including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney \u2013 to testify. Democrats want to question Mulvaney over why the military aid to Ukraine was delayed at a point when Trump was leaning on the country\u2019s new government to investigate Biden. Democrats on Sunday sought to turn up the heat on the President by arguing that he could clear up any questions and complaints about the process by appearing on Capitol Hill himself. \u201cIf Donald Trump doesn\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s hearing, doesn\u2019t like what he\u2019s hearing, he shouldn\u2019t tweet. He should come to the committee and testify under oath and he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath,\u201d the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said. Schumer says Trump should testify -- not tweet -- in impeachment investigation As they grasped for anything that could improve their case, Republicans highlighted reported comments from Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister that the administration did not tell Kiev that there was a link between nearly $400 million in delayed US aid and the need to open an investigation into Biden. But Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN that the Ukrainians \u2013 locked in a desperate battle with Russian-backed separatists \u2013 had an incentive to play down US pressure. \u201cThe Ukrainians are always going to try to put a spin on this,\u201d Murphy said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t accuse the President of extortion. They are presently reliant on the goodwill of Trump in order to keep their country safe.\u201d The notion that the Trump team did not spell out a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d on military aid is undermined by a deposition, released Saturday, by Tim Morrison, a senior National Security Council official. Ex-NSC official corroborates Sondland said he was directed by Trump on Ukraine Morrison said he witnessed a conversation between Sondland and senior Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak in Poland. He said the US envoy to the European Union told him that he suggested to the Ukrainians that military aid could be freed up if the Ukrainian prosecutor general went to a microphone and announced an investigation into Burisma, the energy giant on which Biden\u2019s son Hunter served as a board member. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. This and other revelations help explain why the appearance by Sondland will be so crucial. On Friday, diplomatic aide David Holmes testified behind closed doors that he overheard a phone call in which Trump asked Sondland whether the Kiev government would open investigations he asked for the day before in his now notorious call with his Ukrainian counterpart. Sondland told Trump that Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky \u201cloves your ass\u201d and that Ukraine was going to move forward with the probe Trump had asked for, according to a copy of an opening statement delivered by Holmes and obtained by CNN.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court Thursday to block a Manhattan grand jury subpoena for copies of his financial records and tax returns, teeing up a test of Trump\u2019s expansive claims of immunity. The case marks the first time lawyers for the President have gone to the Supreme Court arguing that the President is immune from criminal proceedings while in office. \u201cIn our petition, we assert that the subpoena violates the US Constitution and therefore is unenforceable,\u201d Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said in a statement. \u201cWe are hopeful that the Supreme Court will grant review in this significant constitutional case and reverse the dangerous and damaging decision of the appeals court.\u201d READ: Trump team asks Supreme Court to block subpoena of President\u2019s tax returns Trump\u2019s attorneys are preparing an even more historic legal case involving the President\u2019s tax returns. Trump\u2019s personal attorneys are expected on Friday to ask the Supreme Court with an emergency petition asking the justices to put on hold a lower court ruling that cleared the way for the House to subpoena the President\u2019s financial records. That request could set up a momentous separation of powers dispute between two branches of the federal government. The request comes a day after a different appeals court in Washington for the second time denied Trump\u2019s attempt to stop an accounting firm from turning over his financial documents to the House. Both cases have so far resulted in losses for the President in the lower courts \u2013 and now represent a test of whether the nation\u2019s highest court, currently dominated by conservatives, will side with Trump. The arguments presented in these cases have similar strains to those the White House and the Department of Justice are making to keep officials from having to testify before Congress in the impeachment proceedings. If they do so, they will finally settle an issue that has dogged the President since before he took office: the release of his tax returns. The justices could rule broadly on the scope of presidential immunity or confine their opinion to the facts of the case at hand concerning a third party subpoena to his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA. Such a ruling would likely come out next spring just as the presidential election is heating up. The court could simply deny to take up the case, leaving in place a lower court opinion that went against the President. That would clear the way for the subpoena to be enforced, although the records would be subject to rules governing grand jury secrecy. The justices, including two of Trump\u2019s nominees, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, will meet behind closed doors in the coming weeks to discuss how to handle the petition. Briefing is expected to be over by the end of November. If the court wants to hear the case this term, it will likely act by mid-January. The case arises out of a state criminal investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus A. Vance, who served a subpoena on Mazars as part of an investigation into hush money payments. Trump\u2019s lawyers sued in federal court to block the subpoena. In the brief, Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote that the \u201cConstitution\u2019s text, structure, and history all confirm that the District Attorney\u2019s grand-jury subpoena for the President\u2019s records violates Article II and the Supremacy Clause.\u201d They urged the court to take up the case this term, arguing that \u201cevery time that a President has asked this Court to hear an important an unsettled claim of immunity under the Constitution,\u201d the court has agreed to do so. The lawyers called the President\u2019s claim a \u201cmomentous question of first impression about the scope of Presidential immunity.\u201d On November 4, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a careful opinion that sidestepped some of the President\u2019s more expansive claims. \u201cWe have no occasion to decide today the precise contours and limitations of president immunity from prosecution,\u201d Judge Robert A. Katzmann wrote for his colleagues. \u201cWe conclude only that presidential immunity does not bar the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena\u201d directed at Trump\u2019s accounting firm, the Court held. Katzmann made sure to note however, that the \u201cpast six Presidents, dating back to President Carter, all voluntarily released their tax returns to the public.\u201d In the opinion he pointed to a 1974 case, United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Court upheld a subpoena directed to President Richard Nixon to produce certain tape recordings central to the Watergate investigation. \u201cThe President has not persuasively explained why, if executive privilege did not preclude enforcement of the subpoena issued in Nixon, the Mazars subpoena must be enjoined despite seeking no privileged information and bearing no relation to the President\u2019s performance of his official functions,\u201d Katzmann wrote. Trump\u2019s opponents believe he may have an uphill battle convincing the court to take the case. \u201cAfter all, it may be a political blockbuster, but it\u2019s not a legal one,\u201d said Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra, who has opposed Trump in court. \u201cThe case presents only a very narrow legal question \u2013 whether a grand jury can subpoena a President\u2019s financial records from a third party like Mazars during the initial stages of a criminal investigation while a President is in office \u2013 and the Manhattan District Attorney will have strong arguments that this is not a legal question that merits the Court\u2019s review, \u201d she added. The Department of Justice wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in the lower court backing Trump, although it took a less expansive view of presidential immunity. Justice Department lawyers argued that a court must demand a high bar in the face of a state criminal subpoena for records. \u201cIt must be shown that the requested material is \u2018essential\u2019 to the proceeding and that it cannot be obtained with \u2018due diligence\u2019 elsewhere,\u201d the lawyers wrote. A district court judge also ruled against the President calling his arguments \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d Despite the losses in courts, the subpoena will not be enforced until the Supreme Court either declines to take up the case, or issues an opinion. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers are expected to go to the Supreme Court on Friday with an emergency petition asking the justices to put on hold a lower court ruling that cleared the way for the House to subpoena the President\u2019s financial records. The case could set up a separation of powers dispute because it involves a clash of two branches. The emergency stay will be filed with Chief Justice John Roberts, who has jurisdiction over the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and he will likely refer it to the full court for consideration. The Supreme Court could act within the next seven days, even if it only issues a short stay to keep the subpoena blocked while it considers the petition. A 2-1 panel of judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit rejected the President\u2019s claims in the case. \u201cDisputes between Congress and the President are a recurring plot in our national story,\u201d the appeals court held. \u201cWe conclude that the subpoena issued by the Committee,\u201d is \u201cvalid\u201d the court said. Friday\u2019s case comes to the Court in a different posture than the case involving the subpoena to Mazars. The Trump administration is asking the justices to first put the lower court ruling on hold, and then consider whether to add the case to the court\u2019s docket. If the justices deny the emergency request, the subpoena will go into effect, and the justices will have sent a strong signal in the case. If they grant the emergency petition, the subpoena will be placed on hold for now and a briefing schedule will be established. Before the justices act, they will likely get a response from the House.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. When it looked like House impeachment investigators might proceed without him, former national security adviser John Bolton, somewhat jilted, demanded that they try harder. Here\u2019s what happened, along with other news Friday wrapping up a crazy busy impeachment inquiry week. Don\u2019t give up His lawyer wrote the House general counsel essentially asking him not to give up on the court case engineered to make Bolton talk. He has information Bolton, according to his lawyer, has some information you might be interested in. He attended \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\u201d Bolton is all over the testimony, in particular, of former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill, who quoted him directly as describing the shadow foreign policy of US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d Why the show? My theory: Bolton is a neocon true believer in a strong executive, so it makes sense he wouldn\u2019t, on his own, want to cross a White House claim of executive privilege and cooperate with House impeachment investigators. But who knows what he will ultimately say. And it\u2019s a good bet that someone with Bolton\u2019s history of supporting executive power won\u2019t think President Donald Trump acted inappropriately even if he\u2019s willing to help take down others in the administration. Breaking \u2013 The Wall Street Journal reports that Rudy Giuliani\u2019s associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have since been charged with violating US election law, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s predecessor Petro Poroshenko that he could get a state visit to Washington in exchange for the investigations Trump later pushed on Zelensky. Even though some Republicans are circling the wagons around Trump and trying insulate him from the rising questions surrounding Giuliani, Trump keeps his lawyer on retainer. The two keep up on the phone, CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown and Michael Warren report. The last known face-to-face meeting Trump had with Giuliani was on October 12, when they met for lunch at Trump\u2019s golf course in Virginia. One person close to the White House said their discussion was friendly and focused primarily on politics. One person familiar said as recently as late October, Trump called Giuliani about once a day. Another person familiar said the President enjoys Giuliani\u2019s company and discusses topics beyond legal issues with him. CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly has been poring over the testimony released Friday from Hill and Alexander Vindman. Hill is the former top Russia adviser on the National Security Council and Vindman is the Ukraine expert on the council. Phil\u2019s analysis below is the most important thing you\u2019ll read today: No lines to Trump? Republicans have repeated to us over and over that there is no direct line to Trump tying the frozen aid to the push for investigations. Assertions. Assumptions. Connecting the dots, but no direct line. This is where the depositions of Hill and Vindman begin to shift our understanding of things. Enter Mulvaney At the July 10 meeting with top Ukrainian officials that went sideways, both Hill and Vindman recount nearly verbatim, Sondland informed the group that he had reached an agreement with Mulvaney about the necessity for Zelensky to move forward on investigations before any White House meeting could be arranged. Hill testimony Hill (pg. 69): \u201cAmbassador Sondland, in front of the Ukrainians, as I came in, was talking about how he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the Ukrainians if they were going to go forward with investigations.\u201d Vindman testimony Vindman (pg 29): So Ambassador Sondland relatively quickly went into outlining how the \u2013 you know, these investigations need to \u2013 or the deliverable for these investigations in order to secure this meeting. \u2026 Q: Do you understand how he came to believe this deliverable was necessary? Vindman: I heard him say that this had been coordinated with the White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney. Throughout Hill\u2019s testimony she recounts Sondland\u2019s close relationship with Mulvaney, which he both touted and often utilized outside of traditional channels used by an ambassador (Vindman hits on this point as well.) Mulvaney froze the aid Add to that: Several witnesses have testified that while they were never given an explanation for why security assistance to the Ukraine was held, they were told by an unnamed White House Office of Management and Budget official that it had come at the direction of Mulvaney, who was operating at the direction of Trump. Hill also backs this up, saying that while she never learned the President personally put a hold on the aid, \u201cI learned that OMB and Mick Mulvaney had put a freeze on.\u201d Was Mulvaney going rogue or doing Trump\u2019s bidding? To be clear: The \u201cdeliverable\u201d in exchange for a meeting at the White House, and the suspension of US security assistance are two separate things, at two separate points in the timeline. But Mulvaney\u2019s central role in both underscores the very clear role the President\u2019s acting chief of staff played at the center of quite literally everything. Does that directly implicate the President? No. But the idea Mulvaney was operating as rogue on this, given the President\u2019s very clear and stated concerns about Ukraine, is difficult to square. My add: There is an obvious line to Trump My add-on to Phil\u2019s point is that whenever someone says to you there is no direct line to the President, you should point out the transcript of the phone call is a pretty direct line. Plus, remember when Mulvaney admitted Trump withheld the money for an investigation and then argued there\u2019s nothing wrong with it because that\u2019s how US foreign policy works? You either see it in there or you\u2019re trying not to. Our reading team found these nuggets in the transcripts. Hill Vindman In one of those freewheeling news conferences conducted in shouts in front of Marine One, Trump said he\u2019d love to have Mulvaney testify but he doesn\u2019t want to give the impeachment inquiry credibility. He said Republicans are kicking Democrats\u2019 asses and says he hardly knows Sondland. He also said he may go to a military parade that President Vladimir Putin invited him to attend in Russia. But the 2020 election may get in the way. Just throwing this out there: Trump and Republicans don\u2019t want to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, but by completely sitting sympathetic White House officials out, they\u2019re basically ensuring that Americans will hear at public hearings next week only from people like Hill, Vindman, top US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor and others who were concerned about Trump and Ukraine. We may get to see only the prosecution, in other words, and not Trump\u2019s defense. Mick Mulvaney has been \u201cacting\u201d chief of staff for nearly a year, which means he hasn\u2019t been given the official title because Trump doesn\u2019t want to give it to him. But Mulvaney will clearly stay in his place. Trump disrespected Rudy Giuliani by failing to find space for him in the Cabinet. Now the man once known as America\u2019s mayor will more likely be remembered as Trump\u2019s top defender \u2013 and an overseas opportunist trying to make some money. Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s first attorney general, was dismissed in disgrace from the President\u2019s inner circle because he failed to protect his boss from the Russia probe. Hoping to get his old job in the Senate back, Sessions recorded a fawning video \u2013 it\u2019s been described as a hostage tape \u2013 trying to get Trump\u2019s blessing for what should be an easy win. Who knows what\u2019s happened to Lindsey Graham, who used to be so attached to John McCain and now seems exclusively for Trump. If I had to guess about Graham, I\u2019d look at the fact that he\u2019s up for reelection in South Carolina this year, but his boosterism goes beyond that. He clearly doesn\u2019t care what folks in the media or in Washington think about him. The charitable assessment is that Graham thinks he can help influence Trump if he stays close to Trump. And the only way he can do that is by praising Trump\u2019s dominance and staying inside so that he can pick his moments \u2013 Syria \u2013 to rebel. The point I\u2019m trying to make here is that no one enters Trump\u2019s orbit, where absolute loyalty and public subservience are required, and emerges with an improved reputation or increased respect. As attention shifts to Mulvaney and Giuliani, and Trump tries to distance himself from another damning witness, David Chalian talked to CNN political correspondent Abby Phillip.

            "article_content": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s fingerprints are everywhere. Despite being invisible for days after shelving his train wreck TV interviews he is emerging with President Donald Trump as the most dominant and intriguing figure in the impeachment drama. The man once feted as America\u2019s mayor is looming over events on Capitol Hill as details of his expansive role in the scandal fill publicly released witness testimony. \u201cHe was always swirling around somewhere,\u201d US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified, adding that Giuliani\u2019s shadow foreign policy mission in Ukraine got more \u201cinsidious\u201d as time went on. Giuliani role unnerves some congressional Republicans Giuliani was ubiquitous, on the phone with Ukrainian officials, inserting himself in US diplomatic meetings, sowing confusion and exasperation about what he was up to, witnesses said. Even Secretary of State Mike Pompeo couldn\u2019t rein in the President\u2019s man, rolling his eyes when Sondland mentioned him and saying: \u201cYes, it\u2019s something we have to deal with,\u201d according to transcripts of Sondland\u2019s testimony. Revelations about Giuliani\u2019s mission are piling up as the Democratic impeachment push races ahead. A critical new stage of the inquiry opens next week with public hearings where the absent Giuliani\u2019s name is sure to be on everyone\u2019s lips. Pages of newly released witness testimony appear to be cementing the Democratic case that Trump abused his power by seeking political favors from Ukraine. The President, however insists he did nothing wrong and is dismissing latest revelations. Prosecutors wary of Giuliani probe colliding with 2020 election, sources say Evidence of Giuliani\u2019s intimate involvement in the Ukraine scheme turns the focus on why the President was apparently so keen to bypass accredited US diplomats and senior officials. And on a day when Giuliani announced his own high powered legal defense team, speculation is growing about his own legal exposure and how the scandal will stain his own legacy. \u201cEven someone like Rudy Giuliani who at one point was a pretty significantly good lawyer realizes you need outside counsel,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Preet Bharara, who like Giuliani is a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, on CNN\u2019s \u201cSituation Room.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that he is in true criminal jeopardy, but at a minimum when people are beginning to investigate you \u2026 you want to have able counsel at your side,\u201d he said. The torrent of revelations about Giuliani will mean that Trump\u2019s attitude and mood regarding his lawyer and most vociferous cable television defender needs to be closely watched. If the President begins to create some distance between them, Giuliani wouldn\u2019t be the first Trump lawyer to face carrying the can for his client\u2019s alleged wrongdoing \u2013 as former Trump attorney Michael Cohen well knows. Most fundamentally, the flurry of disclosures about Giuliani poses the question of whether Congress will ever get to the bottom of what happened in Ukraine without his testimony. Giuliani has said in the past that he would like to testify. But it seems unlikely he has much to gain by doing so. But any attempt to avoid an appearance based on attorney-client privilege or executive privilege would be a tough legal sell given his non-official role and ramblings into Europe \u2013 well beyond the confines of a relationship with Trump. He might also exercise his right to avoid self-incrimination given the current criminal and counter-intelligence investigation into his business dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani rejected the idea that he was enriching himself abroad through his associations with the President in a conversation with CNN Investigative Reporter Drew Griffin. \u201cI am in private law practice. I practice law honorably and well. Never had a complaint. Never had an issue ever in 50 years of private law practice,\u201d he said. Trump has defended Giuliani in recent weeks, but the President does have a history of minimizing his relationship with former associates when they get into trouble. There\u2019s also a possibility that his lawyer could become a useful scapegoat. As recently as last month however, Trump was standing by his fellow New Yorker. \u201cHe\u2019s a great gentleman. He was a great mayor, one of the greatest, maybe the greatest mayor in the history of New York,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a man that looks for corruption \u2026 I know he\u2019s an honorable man.\u201d State Department official to testify that John Bolton warned about influence of Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine Once, the former New York mayor was seen as a rogue freelancer, trampling around in Kiev in a bid to suck up dollars for his private business while peddling conspiracy theories about the 2016 US election. But it\u2019s becoming clear that his role was far more influential than that and he was imbued with presidential authority. Testimony shows Giuliani set up a powerful alternative diplomatic track that not only bypassed official US channels, it also actively inhibited work to better US-Ukraine ties. White House officials argue there\u2019s been no clear proof that Trump directly demanded a quid pro quo with Ukraine, by making military aid and presidential visits conditional on its agreement to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden. But the evidence suggests that the President directly tasked Giuliani with running an off-the-books operation \u2013 that his personal attorney used to seek political favors from Kiev. \u201cHe just kept saying: Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,\u201d Sondland testifed. Over the course of this year, US diplomats gradually became aware that Giuliani was now the fulcrum of the action in US-Ukraine relations. James Baker, the former FBI general counsel, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that any argument that Giuliani was not acting at the behest of the President would not be credible. \u201cApplying your common sense to this situation, you would think that of course the President was acting through Giuliani,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIf the use of Giuliani was to create some sort of plausible deniability like in Iran-Contra, I don\u2019t think it works, because it just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Justice Department distances itself from Giuliani The former US envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, said that he told Giuliani his claims that Biden was acting corruptly in Kiev on behalf of his son Hunter were \u201csimply not credible.\u201d There is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims that the former vice president or his son did anything wrong in Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019ve known him a long time, he\u2019s a person of integrity,\u201d Volker said he told Giuliani and his now indicted associate Lev Parnas at breakfast on July 19 at the Trump hotel in Washington. Volker\u2019s testimony also establishes that Giuliani had a pipeline to Trump in Ukraine matters and was painting a dark picture of new President Volodymyr Zelensky to the US leader. \u201cHe knows all of these things and they have got some bad people around him,\u201d Volker paraphrased the President as saying, when testifying about what he called the \u201cGiuliani factor.\u201d Volker also revealed that the Ukrainians knew how to open a direct channel to Trump \u2013 through Giuliani. Eventually, the President\u2019s fixer became a \u201cproblem\u201d the special envoy said. \u201cThe negative narrative which Mr Giuliani was furthering was the problem \u2026 it was impeding our ability to build the relationship the way we should be doing,\u201d he said. Volker was not the only one frustrated. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton saw Giuliani as a \u201chand grenade\u201d who was \u201cgoing to blow everybody up,\u201d according to a yet-to-be-released deposition by former top White House Russia expert Fiona Hill, sources told CNN last month. Giuliani appears to have been orchestrating the potential quid pro quo that could get Trump impeached. He insisted that a draft statement that the Ukrainians were preparing to issue at one point about corruption include references to Burisma, the energy giant that employed Hunter Biden, and a 2016 conspiracy theory that Ukrainians and not the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cRudy says: \u2018Well, if it doesn\u2019t say Burisma and if it doesn\u2019t say 2016, what does it mean?\u2019 Giuliani said, \u2018You know it\u2019s not credible,\u201d according to Volker\u2019s testimony.

            "article_content": "After two bruising losses in federal court, President Donald Trump\u2019s private lawyers are poised to head to the Supreme Court in hopes that the justices will block a Manhattan grand jury subpoena for the President\u2019s tax records. Taking the case would mean the justices, who strive to stay out of the political fray, would have to deal squarely with an issue that has dogged Trump since before the election and is the subject of other pending legal challenges. If the court affirms the lower court rulings, or declines to take up the government\u2019s appeal, it will clear the way for records to be reviewed by a grand jury, igniting a firestorm even if they aren\u2019t publicly released. If, however, the justices ultimately upend the lower courts, they will be reversing decisions steeped in decades-old precedent and potentially issuing an opinion next spring, just as the presidential campaign gets into full swing. No matter what, the nine justices \u2013 five appointed by Republican presidents, four by Democrats \u2013 could find themselves in the glare of an unwelcome spotlight. And the public is sure to focus on Trump\u2019s two picks, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Under a prior agreement, this should all start to play out before the Thanksgiving break. Lawyers for the President are due to file papers within 10 days in order to keep the subpoena blocked. One unknown is if the Department of Justice will weigh in, which could add a delay. Under normal circumstances, the case will be scheduled for discussion at one of the Supreme Court\u2019s regular closed door conferences. Only the justices would attend that meeting, with no clerks or staff allowed inside. What\u2019s still unclear is at which conference the case will be discussed. There are two conferences scheduled in December, on the 6th and the 13th \u2013 though the justices could hold the matter until the first scheduled conference in early January, or even later. If the briefing is complete by January, the justices could still decide to hear a case for this term with an opinion by the end of June. But while the case is expedited and both sides want a speedy resolution, the justices could also decide to sit on the petition for weeks or months. There\u2019s precedent for that. Last term, the Trump administration urgently asked the Supreme Court to take up a case concerning the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Without explanation, the justices sat on the petition, and only decided at the end of last term to take it up this term. If the court decides to take up the case, the subpoena would remain blocked until the decision is rendered. If the court denies the petition, according to an arrangement between the parties, the subpoena would go into force \u2013 though the information would still be subject to grand jury secrecy rules. The situation has court watchers gaming out Trump\u2019s chances and questioning how the justices will receive his sweeping view of executive power and broad assertions of immunity. So far, a district court judge has issued a scathing opinion criticizing the President\u2019s claims of absolute immunity in the case, and a federal appeals court, while taking a more restrained approach, also ruled against the President. The case arises out of a state criminal investigation led by New York County District Attorney Cyrus A. Vance, who served a subpoena on Trump\u2019s long time accounting firm, Mazars USA, as part of an investigation into hush money payments. Trump\u2019s lawyers sued in federal court to block the subpoena. \u201cUnder Article II, the Supremacy Clause, and the overall structure of our Constitution, the President of the United States cannot be subject to the criminal process while he is in office,\u201d William S. Consovoy, one of the President\u2019s personal lawyers, argued. On November 4, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a careful opinion that sidestepped some of the President\u2019s more expansive claims. \u201cWe have no occasion to decide today the precise contours and limitations of president immunity from prosecution,\u201d Judge Robert A. Katzmann wrote for his colleagues. \u201cWe conclude only that presidential immunity does not bar the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena\u201d directed at Trump\u2019s long time accounting firm, the Court held. Katzmann made sure to note however, that the \u201cpast six Presidents, dating back to President Carter, all voluntarily released their tax returns to the public\u201d. Some believe that the justices will ultimately stay out of the case and deny the government\u2019s petition because the justices may feel that the lower court opinion did not break much new ground. That\u2019s because Katzmann\u2019s opinion was so tailored to the case at hand, dealing only with a third party subpoena for the records that will be subject to rules governing grand jury secrecy. \u201cThe Second Circuit decided this case on particularly narrow grounds, so the legal question might not strike the justices as being as important as it is to the President,\u201d said Jonathan H. Adler of Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Adler said that all the \u201ctruly meaty issues\u201d such as whether a state could prosecute a sitting president for crimes committed while in office were left for another day. \u201cThe court did not decide that the President has no immunity from prosecution nor that the President must himself turn over materials,\u201d Adler said. \u201cIt only decided that a prosecutor may seek information about the President\u2019s business dealings from third parties as part of a criminal investigation before a grand jury.\u201d If Adler is right, and the court denies the government\u2019s request, than the subpoena will go out but the tax returns won\u2019t be immediately available to the public. In court papers, lawyers for Vance point out that \u201ca grand jury, with its laws surrounding secrecy, would be obliged to protect any documents turned over in response to the Mazars subpoena.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up that you might see Trump\u2019s records soon,\u201d Georgetown Law professor Marty Lederman tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cThe parties in the grand jury proceedings can\u2019t make them public,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s term they\u2019ll be disclosed only in a trial of other persons, if they\u2019re relevant there \u2013 which will be months from now at best.\u201d Left unanswered would be more sweeping claims Trump has made in other contexts, such as a letter that White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent to House leadership refusing to participate in the impeachment inquiry, or another pending case where the House is also seeking to subpoena Mazars. In an interview with CNN, Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, suggested that Katzmann\u2019s opinion was airtight. He noted that the court relied upon United States v. Nixon, a 1974 case dating back to the Watergate era where the Supreme Court held that the president was not immune from a federal court\u2019s criminal subpoena. \u201cRichard Nixon had to turn over arguably privileged materials,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cHere there\u2019s no claim of executive privilege, the tax returns were before he was president, he\u2019s not going to be arrested,\u201d Rosen said and added \u201cit\u2019s just ordering the accountants to turn over the documents.\u201d Others think the justices might agree to hear the case, especially if it is asked to do so by the Department of Justice. There is no requirement for the United States to file a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief in the case at all, and the solicitor general rarely files uninvited amicus briefs. But a key factor for the justices may be whether the government asks the court to take up the case and stresses the importance of the issue to the executive branch. Indeed, the Justice Department did file a brief before the Second Circuit backing the President. Notably, the Justice Department position did not have the breadth of the arguments made by Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, but the government lawyers said \u201cthe issuance of a grand jury subpoena seeking the President\u2019s personal records raises profound constitutional concerns.\u201d In briefs they encouraged the courts to adopt a bright line rule that requires a \u201cheightened, particularized showing for any state criminal subpoena for a President\u2019s personal records.\u201d Another reason that the justices might step in, according to Steven Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of law, is out of deference to the President. \u201cThe Court historically has shown special procedural solicitude to the President in cases like this, and usually goes out of its way to ensure that the President is given his due without regard to the substantive claims he\u2019s raising,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cThrough that lens, a grant here would simply be the Supreme Court saying that it should be up to the Justices, and not the lower courts, to decide when an under what circumstances the President\u2019s personal information can properly be subject to a subpoena.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A top National Security Council official testified Thursday that he was told President Donald Trump wanted a top Ukrainian official to announce an investigation that would help the President politically before US security aid to Ukraine would be released, corroborating a key part of US diplomat Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony that\u2019s central to the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, according to sources familiar with the testimony. Tim Morrison, the top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council, also told House impeachment investigators that he was advised by then-White House official Fiona Hill to stay away from the parallel Ukraine policy being pursued by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, according to one of the sources. Morrison said in his closed-door testimony that he was concerned the July 25 call transcript between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would leak and could have negative ramifications, according to multiple sources and a copy of his opening statement obtained by CNN. But he also made the point that he saw nothing wrong with the July call. \u201cI want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed,\u201d Morrison said, according to his opening statement. Morrison, who will soon be departing the White House, was involved with discussions after the call about how to handle the transcript, the sources said. Ultimately, the call transcript was filed in a highly classified system, a decision that\u2019s among the issues Democrats are seeking answers about in their impeachment investigation into Trump and Ukraine. Morrison, whose appearance on Capitol Hill lasted for more than eight hours, backed up last week\u2019s testimony from Taylor, currently the top US diplomat in Ukraine, about interactions the two had regarding the President\u2019s efforts to press for investigations while US aid to Ukraine was held up. While he did deviate from Taylor on some details, Morrison testified that Sondland told him the President would release the aid if the Ukrainian prosecutor general announced an investigation, according to sources. \u201cI reviewed the statement Ambassador Taylor provided this inquiry on October 22, 2019. I can confirm that the substance of his statement, as it relates to conversations he and I had, is accurate,\u201d Morrison said. Still, Morrison\u2019s view that there was nothing wrong with the July call differs from the testimony offered by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another National Security Council staffer who, like Morrison, listened into the call between Trump and Zelensky. READ: Tim Morrison's opening statement before House impeachment investigators Morrison did not raise any concerns about the call to the National Security Council lawyers, as Vindman did, according to one source. And Morrison described the rough transcript released by the White House as a \u201cfair representation\u201d of the tone and content of the call, the source said. CNN previously reported Morrison believed the National Security Council process in regards to Ukraine was legally sound, and that he was expected to corroborate Taylor\u2019s testimony on investigations and US aid to Ukraine. Morrison\u2019s concerns, sources said, were over the prospect that the call transcript would leak. He was concerned about how the leaked transcript would play out in a \u201cpolarized environment\u201d in Washington, how it would impact bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress and how it would impact Ukraine\u2019s perception of the US. In addition to being told to stay away from Giuliani, Morrison also seemed critical of the role that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland played over Ukraine policy, one source said. Morrison\u2019s testimony came as the House voted Thursday to formalize the impeachment procedures as Democrats consider whether to impeach a President for just the third time in history. But Republicans emerged from the deposition saying Morrison\u2019s testimony undercuts the Democrats\u2019 argument that the President committed impeachable offenses. \u201cMr. Morrison\u2019s testimony was very damaging to the Democrats\u2019 narrative,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, suggesting that his testimony contradicts other witnesses. The very simple reason why Democrats switched strategy on an impeachment vote \u201cSome of the other witnesses have been less than candid,\u201d Meadows said. A senior White House official said the White House view is that Morrison\u2019s testimony is good for Trump because he said he thought the rough transcript of the July call was fair and accurate and he didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with it legally. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees appear to be nearing an end to the closed-door depositions phase of their impeachment inquiry, and Thursday\u2019s resolution laid out rules for the Intelligence panel as it prepares to soon hold public hearings. The committees have scheduled a week\u2019s worth of depositions with Trump administration officials next week, when Congress is out of session, but it\u2019s not clear how many will attend. The biggest potential witness looming is former national security adviser John Bolton, who is scheduled to appear next Thursday. His attorney said Wednesday that he would not attend voluntarily and needed a subpoena, but House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff declined to say Thursday if he planned to issue one. Taylor, who testified last week, cited Morrison more than a dozen times in his 15-page opening statement, in which he said that he was told that US aid to Ukraine and a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Zelensky were conditions on Ukraine publicly announcing investigations that could help the President politically. Source: Bill Taylor will 'fulfill his duty' if asked to testify in impeachment probe One difference Morrison had from Taylor\u2019s account was when Taylor testified that Morrison had relayed to him that Trump told Sondland he wanted Zelensky to \u201cgo to a microphone\u201d and announce an investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election. But in describing his conversation with Taylor, Morrison said that Sondland indicated it would have been sufficient for Trump if the Ukrainian prosecutor general announced the investigations he sought, according to one source. Another detail that Morrison said was different was the location of an interaction, sources said. At times, Morrison\u2019s attorney has instructed his client not to answer questions about interactions with the President, multiple sources said. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida, told CNN that Morrison\u2019s attorney got into a \u201ctussle\u201d with House Intelligence Committee lawyers about what questions he could answer. She said they would likely return to those questions later. \u201cI just think the witness today had some difficulty in answering certain questions,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. Prior to the testimony, Barbara Van Gelder, Morrison\u2019s lawyer, told CNN that privilege issues are fact specific, and they will be handled in accordance with the House rules if they come up during the deposition. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown, Kylie Atwood and Mychael Schnell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, plans to tell House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that he was so troubled by President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President that he reported his concerns to a superior, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by CNN. Vindman will also tell lawmakers that he felt Trump\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine for investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son undermined American national security. Read the statement below: Opening Statement of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander S. Vindman Before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform October 29, 2019 Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you for the opportunity to address the Committees concerning the activities relating to Ukraine and my role in the events under investigation. Background I have dedicated my entire professional life to the United States of America. For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in the United States Army. As an infantry officer, I served multiple overseas tours, including South Korea and Germany, and a deployment to Iraq for combat operations. In Iraq, I was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart. Since 2008, I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in Eurasia. In this role, I have served in the United States\u2019 embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington, D.C., I was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs where I authored the principle strategy for managing competition with Russia. In July 2018, I was asked to serve at the National Security Council. The privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in my military service, but also in my personal history. I sit here, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, an immigrant. My family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old. Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night. He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream. I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics. For over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations. Introduction Before recounting my recollection of various events under investigation, I want to clarify a few issues. I am appearing today voluntarily pursuant to a subpoena and will answer all questions to the best of my recollection. I want the Committees to know I am not the whistleblower who brought this issue to the CIA and the Committees\u2019 attention. I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate as to the identity of the whistleblower. Also, as I will detail herein, I did convey certain concerns internally to National Security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command. As an active duty military officer, the command structure is extremely important to me. On many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities. I believe that any good military officer should and would do the same, thus providing his or her best advice to leadership. Furthermore, in performing my coordination role as a Director on the National Security Council, I provided readouts of relevant meetings and communications to a very small group of properly cleared national security counterparts with a relevant need-to-know. My Service on the National Security Council When I joined the White House\u2019s National Security Council (\u201cNSC\u201d), I reported to Dr. Fiona Hill, who in turn reported to John Bolton, the National Security Advisor. My role at the NSC includes developing, coordinating, and executing plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic national security issues for the countries in my portfolio, which includes Ukraine. In my position, I coordinate with a superb cohort of inter-agency partners. I regularly prepare internal memoranda, talking points, and other materials for the National Security Advisor and senior staff. Most of my interactions relate to national security issues and are therefore especially sensitive. I would urge the Committees to carefully balance the need for information against the impact that disclosure would have on our foreign policy and national security. I have never had direct contact or communications with the President. The Geopolitical Importance of Ukraine Since 2008, Russia has manifested an overtly aggressive foreign policy, leveraging military power and employing hybrid warfare to achieve its objectives of regional hegemony and global influence. Absent a deterrent to dissuade Russia from such aggression, there is an increased risk of further confrontations with the West. In this situation, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to U.S. national security interests because Ukraine is a frontline state and a bulwark against Russian aggression. In spite of being under assault from Russia for more than five years, Ukraine has taken major steps towards integrating with the West. The U.S. government policy community\u2019s view is that the election of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the promise of reforms to eliminate corruption will lock in Ukraine\u2019s Western-leaning trajectory, and allow Ukraine to realize its dream of a vibrant democracy and economic prosperity. Given this perspective and my commitment to advancing our government\u2019s strategic interests, I will now recount several events that occurred. Relevant Events When I joined the NSC in July 2018, I began implementing the administration\u2019s policy on Ukraine. In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency. This narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy. While my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine\u2019s prospects, this alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine. April 21, 2019: President Trump Calls Ukraine President Zelenskyy On April 21, 2019, Zelenskyy was seen as a unifying figure within the country. He was the first candidate to win a majority in every region of the country, breaking the claims that Ukraine would be subject to a perpetual divide between the Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking populations. President Zelenskyy ran on a platform of unity, reform, and anti-corruption, which resonated with the entire country. In support of U.S. policy objectives to support Ukrainian sovereignty, President Trump called President Zelenskyy on April 21, 2019. I was one of several staff and officers who listened to the call. The call was positive, and President Trump expressed his desire to work with President Zelenskyy and extended an invitation to visit the White House. May 21, 2019: Inauguration Delegation Goes to Ukraine On May 21, 2019, I was directed by Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill to join the delegation attending President Zelenkskyy\u2019s inauguration. When the delegation returned, they provided a debriefing to President Trump and explained their positive assessment of President Zelenskyy and his team. I did not participate in the debriefing. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected President of Ukraine in a landslide victory. President Oleksandr Danylyuk Visit \u2013 July 10, 2019 On July 10, 2019, Oleksandr Danylyuk, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council for Ukraine, visited Washington, D.C. for a meeting with National Security Advisor Bolton. Ambassadors Volker and Sondland also attended, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The meeting proceeded well until the Ukrainians broached the subject of a meeting between the two presidents. The Ukrainians saw this meeting as critically important in order to solidify the support of their most important international partner. Amb. Sondland started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President, at which time Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short. Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma. I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push. Dr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate. Following the debriefing meeting, I reported my concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel. Dr. Hill also reported the incident to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel. Election Call \u2013 July 25, 2019 On July 21, 2019, President Zelenskyy\u2019s party won Parliamentary elections in a landslide victory. The NSC proposed that President Trump call President Zelenskyy to congratulate him. On July 25, 2019, the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the Vice President. As the transcript is in the public record, we are all aware of what was said. I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel. Conclusion The United States and Ukraine are and must remain strategic partners, working together to realize the shared vision of a stable, prosperous, and democratic Ukraine that is integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. Our partnership is rooted in the idea that free citizens should be able to exercise their democratic rights, choose their own destiny, and live in peace. It has been a great honor to serve the American people and a privilege to work in the White House and on the National Security Council. I hope to continue to serve and advance America\u2019s national security interests. Thank you again for your consideration, and now I would be happy to answer your questions.",

            "article_content": "Two men who have served as Rudy Giuliani\u2019s conduit to Ukraine pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Wednesday to charges that they funneled foreign money to US campaign coffers, with one of their lawyers suggesting executive privilege could apply to material in the case. Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas were indicted earlier this month on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. The two are linked closely with Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney. For months, they have aided Giuliani\u2019s effort to compile what he has claimed is damaging information on Trump\u2019s political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, whose son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Belarus-born Fruman and Ukraine-born Parnas, both US citizens and Florida residents who wore American flag pins on the lapels of their jackets Wednesday, introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, and Parnas\u2019 company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, paid Giuliani $500,000, he told Reuters. Giuliani himself is a subject of the ongoing investigation by the federal prosecutors who charged Fruman and Parnas, a probe that is examining Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian business dealings, CNN has reported. In court Wednesday, Parnas\u2019 lawyer raised possible issues of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege in the material prosecutors have obtained in their investigation, invoking Giuliani\u2019s name for the first time in court in the campaign finance case. Parnas\u2019 lawyer appeared to imply that because Giuliani had both represented Parnas and worked for President Donald Trump, some evidence could be subject to executive privilege. \u201cMr. Parnas was using Rudy Giuliani as his lawyer. Some of the companies were using Rudy Giuliani as their lawyer,\u201d Parnas\u2019 attorney, Ed MacMahon, said. \u201cAnd then we have the issue of Mr. Giuliani working as personal attorney for the President.\u201d He continued: \u201cThese are issues that we need to be very sensitive to.\u201d He suggested the matter might warrant the involvement of the US Justice Department, its Office of Legal Counsel or the White House counsel\u2019s office. US District Judge Paul Oetken asked MacMahon: \u201cSo he was working for Mr. Giuliani, and Mr. Giuliani worked for him?\u201d Federal investigation of Rudy Giuliani includes counterintelligence probe MacMahon didn\u2019t respond directly in court, though when asked again later by reporters he replied: \u201cYes, as to both.\u201d MacMahon declined to specify what kind of work Giuliani had done for his client\u2019s companies. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve already said enough.\u201d In response to MacMahon\u2019s concerns in court, prosecutor Rebekah Donaleski told the judge that prosecutors have already set up a filter team, which is a separate set of prosecutors who are assigned to comb through evidence and eliminate material that is subject to attorney-client privilege. She suggested discussing the issue of potential executive privilege in a separate setting, an idea Oetken endorsed. Concerns about privilege arose in court after prosecutors told the judge about the scope of discovery material, which they said includes returns from more than a dozen search warrants, including those for premises as well as email and social media accounts, and subpoena returns for more than 50 bank accounts and telephone numbers. Following the hearing Wednesday, Parnas, accompanied by his wife, defended himself in remarks outside the courthouse. \u201cMany false things have been said about me and my family in the press and media recently,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to defending myself vigorously in court, and I\u2019m certain that in time the truth will be revealed, and I will be vindicated. In the end, I put my faith in God.\u201d Fruman and Parnas\u2019 co-defendants, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who are each charged with one count of conspiracy, were arraigned last week and pleaded not guilty. All four are due in court again on December 2. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has become increasingly frustrated in recent weeks by the departure of top State Department officials and claims that he failed to defend the former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, from a smear campaign against her, according to three sources familiar with the situation. As part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Yovanovitch testified to Congress this week that she was unfairly removed based on false claims pushed by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. One of the sources tell CNN that Pompeo was alerted to internal and external concerns about Giuliani\u2019s effort to push out Yovanovitch, but Pompeo failed to act \u2013 he was wary of getting too deeply involved over fears of derailing US-Ukraine policy and potentially sharing the fate of his former colleague John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser who was fired for not being aligned with the President. In a letter sent in the spring, which has not been previously reported, a handful of former US ambassadors to Ukraine urged top State Department officials to take action and defend Yovanovitch. They got a response from one of Pompeo\u2019s closest senior officials, Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, saying the message had been received and would be considered. Yet Pompeo did nothing and less than two months later, Yovanovitch was recalled from her post at the behest of Trump. Pompeo\u2019s apparent choice not to put guardrails between State officials and Giuliani has come under scrutiny by House Democrats who are bent on learning as much as they can about what exactly Pompeo knew of Giuliani\u2019s dealings. In recent interviews, Pompeo has declined to answer questions about Giuliani\u2019s entanglement in the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy. He was however aware of it. In March, Pompeo received a packet from Giuliani containing unfounded claims about Yovanovitch, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter regarding their dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has claimed Pompeo spoke with him to confirm the packet had been received and that he was passing along the information for an investigation. It is unclear if Pompeo actually did share the packet with the Department of Justice. Pompeo\u2019s deputy, Brechbuhl, did pass it to the State Department\u2019s inspector general. Pompeo has had to accept the resignation of two top State Department officials, Kurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, who resigned last month, and Michael McKinley, his hand-picked senior adviser, who quit last week. Both have testified to Congress despite the State Department\u2019s refusal to comply with subpoena requests. The State Department did not return CNN requests for comment. Mounting criticism about his handling of the matter has left the Secretary of State feeling victimized, according to those familiar with his thinking. \u201cHe has been very disappointed,\u201d explained one of the sources who spoke with Pompeo. \u201cHe feels that with these departures, the actual good work on Ukraine policy has come to a halt.\u201d As a string of State Department officials have testified on Capitol Hill, Pompeo has stayed away from Washington and kept a packed foreign schedule. He was visiting with the Pope in Italy when Volker voluntarily testified to Congress. And this week he traveled to Turkey for talks on Syria with Vice President Mike Pence as even more State Department officials testified. Despite his efforts to distance himself, the continued testimony from current State Department officials has drawn Pompeo closer into the controversy. In his prepared statement on Thursday, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland aligned himself with career diplomats and passed responsibility for his role in the situation to political players, including Trump and Pompeo. What House investigators have learned after two weeks of Ukraine interviews Sondland said that Pompeo was aware of all his efforts on Ukraine policy and set him to work on the country from his first day on the job, despite the fact that Ukraine is not a member country of the EU. Sondland said Pompeo even sent him a recent congratulatory note, saying that he was \u201cdoing great work,\u201d and to \u201ckeep banging away.\u201d Pompeo has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry. Former State Department senior adviser McKinley also testified Wednesday that he repeatedly asked Pompeo for a show of support for Yovanovitch \u2013 and as Pompeo remained silent, he never explained his reasoning. McKinley had grown close with Pompeo over the last two years and was recruited into the top post by the secretary. McKinley told lawmakers that Pompeo\u2019s decision not to offer Yovanovitch support was a key reason for his decision to resign last week. However, a source close to Pompeo pushed back on the way that McKinley told the story, telling CNN, \u201cI think (McKinley) knew damn well that Pompeo was trying to help her.\u201d Despite what he may have been doing behind the scenes, Pompeo ultimately failed to intervene or speak out publicly on Yovanovitch\u2019s behalf before or after she was recalled. In fact, it seems Pompeo attempted to distance himself even further from the controversy in the heat of the moment. He did not tell Yovanovitch exactly what was happening when she got the sudden message to get on the next plane back to the US, she told lawmakers. The guardrails are off the Trump presidency Yovanovitch told Congress that upon her return to Washington it was John Sullivan, the Deputy Secretary of State at the time, who met with her to break the news she would not be going back to Ukraine as the US ambassador. Some former State Department officials felt Pompeo was somewhat justified in not publicly defending Yovanovitch. \u201cShe was treated badly but she could have been treated worse. She could have been fired and sacked from the State Department but that did not happen,\u201d John Herbst, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine and expert at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. \u201cI understand foreign service officers who wanted him to shout from a rooftop that the accusations against her were unfounded and she was a great Ambassador. I would have liked to see that. But maybe he was not sure that he could do that and retain his job or influence,\u201d he said. Critics argue that by not saying anything to defend Yovanovitch, Pompeo has sided with a foreign disinformation campaign built on false narratives dealing with Ukraine amplified by Giuliani, Trump and sources of Russian propaganda. \u201cThe lack of support has broader implications,\u201d said Steve Pfifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton, and currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Pompeo\u2019s decision not to defend Yovanovitch, intentionally or not, sent a message to the world, Pfifer said. \u201cThe word is that if you have an American ambassador and he or she is problematic, put out some information, get it to Rudy Giuliani that this ambassador bad-mouthed the President.\u201d While CNN\u2019s fact-checkers have largely discredited the unfounded claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, related to their dealings with Ukraine, it\u2019s challenging to determine their origin. It seems that Trump, Giuliani and Kremlin-backed media have engaged in parallel processes of using this information as part of a broader strategy of denying everything by blaming anyone else, said Bret Schafer from Alliance for Securing Democracy. A whistleblower complaint regarding Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, which was released publicly last month, alleged Trump \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\u201d and labeled Giuliani as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in the plot. The transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 that was also released to the public \u2013 showed Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. Giuliani was discussed, according to the transcript, with Trump telling the Ukrainian president at one point, \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call.\u201d Pompeo admitted, about a week after the phone call\u2019s transcript was released, that he was on that call. And in recent interviews he has repeatedly defended Trump\u2019s conversation as entirely appropriate. George Kent, a State Department official who focused on Ukraine, told lawmakers Tuesday that his superior, assistant secretary for European Affairs Philip Reeker, told him to \u201clay low\u201d when he raised concerns about Giuliani. Now, Congress has requested to hear from Reeker. It is unclear if Pompeo told top State Department officials not to raise concerns about Giuliani or the removal of Yovanovitch. The testimony from McKinley this week showed Pompeo has kept a tight hold on his thinking throughout this controversy, even with those he is closely engaged with. Meanwhile, in the last few weeks, the State Department has fallen in line with the White House in not complying in part with the impeachment inquiry. 'Forceful, blunt and undiplomatic': the ambassador now at the center of the impeachment probe Ambassador Sondland\u2019s lawyer explained in a letter to congressional committees that Sondland and others in his position have been prevented from providing documents to Congress because the State Department \u201casserted that disclosure of these materials may implicate executive privilege, confidentiality, and other constitutional interests of the executive branch.\u201d The failure to release pertinent documents to Congress raises questions about what details they provide regarding Pompeo\u2019s awareness and actions on the specific developments. Mulvaney brashly admits quid pro quo over Ukraine aid as key details emerge -- and then denies doing so As the State Department has stopped working with Congress due to orders from the White House, Pompeo himself continues to defend Trump. He has called the Ukraine impeachment inquiry a conspiracy theory to take down the President. But there will be new questions about conversations regarding quid pro quo in the coming days given the pronouncement by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in a news conference Thursday that the US withheld military aid from Ukraine in hopes of securing a promise that the foreign government would look into the possible presence of the physical Democratic National Committee server hacked by the Russians in 2016. Pompeo, whose department oversees a hefty amount of that assistance to Ukraine, was also asked last month if it would be a problem if there were a quid pro quo arrangement. Pompeo said it is his job to be sure that foreign assistance is \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d and that \u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars are used appropriately.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is speaking behind closed doors on Thursday before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. Read his prepared remarks provided in advance of his deposition: INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Thank you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to provide this testimony today. I was disappointed that the State Department prevented me, at the last minute, from testifying earlier on October 8, 2019. But your issuance of a subpoena has supported my appearance here today. I am pleased to provide the following testimony: First, let me say that it is an honor to serve the people of the United States as their Ambassador to the European Union. The U.S. Mission to the EU is the direct link between the United States and the 28 member EU countries, America\u2019s longest standing allies and one of the largest economic blocks in the world. A strong, united, and peaceful Europe helps to uphold the norms that maintain political stability and promote economic prosperity around the world. Second, I would like to thank my staff and the many dedicated public servants with whom I have the privilege to work every day. I have benefited immeasurably from their collective wisdom, experience, and hard work. Their patriotism serves as an example to all of us. Third, let me note that my goal today is to answer your questions directly and clearly, to the best of my knowledge. I have not shared this Opening Statement in advance with either the White House or the State Department. These are my own words. It is important to emphasize, at the outset, that I have had limited time to review the relevant facts in order to prepare for my testimony. I will do my utmost to answer the Committees\u2019 questions fully and truthfully, but the shortness of time is challenging. Let me also say that I have good friends from both sides of the aisle, many of whom have reached out to me to provide support. As we go through this process, I understand that some people may have their own specific agendas: some may want me to say things to protect the President at all costs; some may want me to provide damning facts to support the other side. But none of that matters to me. I have no interest in pursuing higher office or taking political shots. Simply put, I am NOT here to push an agenda. I am here to tell the truth. Personal Background I am a lifelong Republican. Like all of my political Ambassadorial colleagues, I am an appointee of the President and serve at the pleasure of the President. I also know that party affiliations are set aside when representing the United States. Having served on non-partisan commissions by the appointment of three Democratic governors and on the transition team for Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, another Democrat, I am well accustomed to working across the aisle. For example, I worked briefly with former Vice President Biden\u2019s office in connection with the Vice President\u2019s nationwide anti-cancer initiative and admire his long record of public service. I had bipartisan support for my ambassadorial nomination. My successful business background and results-oriented focus made me, in my view, well suited to bring the fresh perspective to U.S. foreign policy that President Trump had sought. UKRAINE PORTFOLIO As you know, I was confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan voice vote as Ambassador to the EU on June 28, 2018, and I assumed that role in Brussels on July 9, 2018. From my very first days as Ambassador, Ukraine has been a part of my broader work pursuing U.S. national interests. Ukraine\u2019s political and economic development are critical to the long-lasting stability of Europe. Moreover, the conflict in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, which began nearly five years ago, continues as one of the most significant security crises for Europe and the United States. As the U.S. Ambassador to the EU, I have always viewed my Ukraine work as central to advancing U.S.-EU foreign policy. Indeed, for decades, under both Republican and Democrat Administrations, the United States has viewed Ukraine with strategic importance, in part to counter Russian aggression in Europe and to support Ukraine energy independence. My involvement in issues concerning Ukraine, while a small part of my overall portfolio, was nevertheless central to my ambassadorial responsibilities. In this sense, Ukraine is similar to other non-EU countries, such as Venezuela, Iran, and Georgia, with respect to which my Mission and I coordinate closely with our EU partners to promote policies that reflect our common values and interests. I always endeavoured to keep my State Department and National Security Council colleagues informed of my actions and to seek their input. I understand that all my actions involving Ukraine had the blessing of Secretary Pompeo as my work was consistent with long-standing U.S. foreign policy objectives. Indeed, very recently, Secretary Pompeo sent me a congratulatory note that I was doing great work, and he encouraged me to keep banging away. KEY TIMELINE While I continue my work in Europe, here in Washington, there continues to be inaccurate and unsourced speculation regarding my work in Ukraine. To be helpful, as you frame your questions, let me share an outline of the facts: First, as Ambassador to the EU, my Ukraine portfolio began on Day One, from the very first briefing materials I received in the Summer of 2018. Although it did not consistently occupy a great deal of my time, involvement in Ukraine matters was considered by the career professionals who prepared my briefing materials to be an important part of my portfolio. On July 13, 2018, just four days after assuming my post, I received a delegation from the government of Ukraine at the U.S. Mission in Brussels. This meeting was sought by the then Ukraine government and, like most meetings, was proposed and arranged by career EU Mission staff. Following those initial contacts, I attended numerous meetings in Brussels and other locations in Europe during the Fall of 2018 to advance U.S. interests in Ukraine. These interests reflect a whole of government engagement, not just a narrow focus. We discussed economic  development, energy independence, and security concerns regarding Russian aggression in Ukraine. From my position in Brussels, my goal has always been to facilitate and expedite the integration of Ukraine into the broader Western norms of Europe and the United States. To be clear, my role has been to support my colleagues in the State Department for whom Ukraine issues are a full-time job and to lend my voice when helpful. These professionals included first and foremost the Head of Mission, which at the start of my service was Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and, more recently, Charge de Affaires William Taylor and their Embassy staff. I worked with Ambassador Yovanovitch personally during my first official visit to Ukraine in February 2019, and I found her to be an excellent diplomat with a deep command of Ukrainian internal dynamics, the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and associated regional issues. She was a delight to work with during our visit to Odessa, Ukraine. I was never a part of any campaign to disparage or dislodge her, and I regretted her departure. Similarly, in my time working with Ambassador Taylor, I have found him to be an insightful, strategic, and effective representative of U.S. interests. He cares deeply about the future of Ukraine and is a dedicated public servant. The Ukraine Mission worked hand in hand with Special Envoy Kurt Volker, another experienced diplomat with a special remit to address  he ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Mr. Volker is an exemplary professional. I viewed my role as adding value to the broader efforts of the Ukraine team through my engagements with high level leadership in Brussels and Washington. During my first official trip to Ukraine on February 26, 2019, I traveled to Odessa with Special Envoy Kurt Volker, former EU Deputy Secretary General Jean Christophe-Belliard, a representative of the Romanian EU Presidency, and many other officials. Joined by Ambassador Yovanovitch, U.S. Navy Commander Matthew Powell, and many others, we met with thenUkraine President Poroshenko on the U.S. Navy ship Donald J. Cook. This visit demonstrated the U.S. military\u2019s commitment to Ukraine and furthered our broader agenda of aligning with our EU partners to counterbalance Russian influence in the region. This visit followed on the heels of a Congressional Delegation to Brussels led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This delegation met with me and senior EU leadership. In these meetings in Brussels and Odessa, as in nearly every meeting in which Ukraine issues were discussed, corruption and rule of law were central topics of conversation. Corruption poses challenges to the legitimacy and stability of government; corruption is also an economic issue. Successive Ukrainian governments have sought to attract Western investors as a counterbalance to Russian interference and oligarch control of key Ukrainian companies. Western investment is fully in the strategic interests of the United States and our EU partners. However, efforts to access private markets have been made extremely difficult by the longstanding corruption. As one example, we frequently had conversations with Ukrainian leaders about transparency and corporate governance issues involving Naftogaz. In my experience, these issues have been the consistent context in which both my team and our Ukraine counterparts have raised corruption problems for many years. We have received very positive feedback from the NSC regarding our joint efforts to address these challenges in Ukraine. On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected President of Ukraine, beating incumbent President Petro Poroshenko with nearly 73% of the vote. This was a momentous event in Ukraine political history and for the overall U.S.-Ukraine relationship. On May 20, 2019, given the significance of this election, I attended the inauguration of President Zelensky as part of the U.S. delegation led by U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, along with Senator Ron Johnson, Special Envoy Volker, and Alex Vindman from the NSC. During this visit, we developed positive views of the new Ukraine President and his desire to promote a stronger relationship between Kiev and Washington, to make reforms necessary to attract Western economic investment, and to address Ukraine\u2019s well-known and longstanding corruption issues. On May 23, 2019, three days after the Zelensky inauguration, we in the U.S. delegation debriefed President Trump and key aides at the White House. We emphasized the strategic importance of Ukraine and the strengthening relationship with President Zelensky, a reformer who received a strong mandate from the Ukrainian people to fight corruption and pursue greater economic prosperity. We asked the White House to arrange a working phone call from President Trump and a working Oval Office visit. However, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns. It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani. It is my understanding that Energy Secretary Perry and Special Envoy Volker took the lead on reaching out to Mr. Giuliani, as the President had directed. Indeed, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I were disappointed by our May 23, 2019 White House debriefing. We strongly believed that a call and White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky was important and that these should be scheduled promptly and without any pre-conditions. We were also disappointed by the President\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani. Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine. However, based on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns. We chose the latter path, which seemed to all of us \u2013 Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and myself \u2013 to be the better alternative. But I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. Following my return to Brussels and continuing my focus on stronger U.S.-EU ties, my Mission hosted a U.S. Independence Day event on June 4, 2019. Despite press reports, this event was planned months in advance and involved approximately 700 guests from government, the diplomatic corps, the media, business, and civil society. The night featured remarks by the Ambassador and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs. Following the main event, we hosted a smaller, separate dinner for about 30 people. President Zelensky and several other leaders of EU and non-EU member states attended the dinner, along with Secretary Perry, U.S. State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl on behalf of Secretary Pompeo, and numerous other key U.S. and EU officials. Though planned long in advance with the focus on improving transatlantic relations, we also viewed this event as an opportunity to present President Zelensky to various EU and U.S. officials and to build upon the enhanced government ties. The event was well-received. Contrary to some reporting, Bono did not attend or perform. During a trip to Washington on July 10, 2019, with the express, advance invitation of Ambassador Bolton, I joined White House meetings between representatives of Ukraine National Security and Defense with U.S. NSC officials, including Ambassador Bolton, along with Secretary Perry and Ambassador Volker. I understood following the meeting, as reflected in the summary of a phone call the next day between Secretary Perry and Ambassador Bolton, that there was a difference of opinion between Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and myself, on the one hand, and the NSC, on the other. We three favored promptly scheduling a call and meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky; the NSC did not. But if Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later. We had regular communications with the NSC about Ukraine, both before and after the July meeting; and neither Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, nor anyone else on the NSC staff ever expressed any concerns to me about our efforts, any complaints about coordination between State and the NSC, or, most importantly, any concerns that we were acting improperly. Furthermore, my boss Secretary Pompeo was very supportive of our Ukraine strategy. After a series of delays, on July 25, 2019, President Trump called President Zelensky to congratulate him on the recently concluded Ukraine parliamentary elections, which in Ukraine are separate from the Presidential elections. This was an important call, and I was pleased to hear that it occurred. But let me emphasize: I was not on that July 25, 2019 call and I did not see a transcript of that call until September 25, 2019, when the White House publicly released it. None of the brief and general call summaries I received contained any mention of Burisma or former Vice President Biden, nor even suggested that President Trump had made any kind of request of President Zelensky. I had heard afterwards that the July 25, 2019 call went well in solidifying a relationship between the two leaders. On July 26, 2019, Special Envoy Volker and I, along with others, met with President Zelensky in Kiev, Ukraine. This was a significant bilateral meeting, involving large teams from the United States and Ukraine, that had been planned by Special Envoy Volker\u2019s team weeks in  advance and was not in any way tied to the July 25, 2019 White House call. I was invited to this meeting in early July. Indeed, as we planned the Kiev meeting, we did not know when or even if the White House call would occur. During this July 26, 2019 meeting in Kiev, we were able to promote further engagement, including discussions about a future Zelensky visit to the White House. I do recall a brief discussion with President Trump before my visit to Kiev. That call was very short, nonsubstantive, and did not encompass any of the substance of the July 25, 2019 White House call with President Zelensky. Finally, the White House and NSC invited me to the United Nations for the first face-toface meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky in New York City, which I attended on September 25, 2019. This was a positive meeting, and I am pleased that the leaders were able to meet for the first time face-to-face. CLARIFYING OTHER ISSUES Given the various misstatements in the press, I want to take this time to clarify several issues, including questions involving the Ukraine public statement, the involvement of former Mayor Giuliani, and other alleged issues. Ukraine Public Statement First, I knew that a public embrace of anti-corruption reforms by Ukraine was one of the pre-conditions for securing a White House meeting with President Zelensky. My view was, and has always been, that such Western reforms are consistent with U.S. support for rule of law in Ukraine going back decades, under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Nothing about that request raised any red flags for me, Ambassador Volker, or Ambassador Taylor. Consequently, I supported the efforts of Ambassador Volker to encourage the Ukrainian government to adopt a public statement setting out its reform priorities. My recollection is that the statement was written primarily by the Ukrainians with Ambassador Volker\u2019s guidance, and offered my assistance when asked. This was the \u201cdeliverable\u201d referenced in some of my messages \u2013 a deliverable/public statement that President Trump wanted to see or hear before a White House meeting could occur. The fact that we were working on this public statement was not a secret. More broadly, such public statements are a common and necessary part of U.S. diplomacy. Requesting that parties align their public messaging in advance of any important leadership meeting is a routine way to leverage the power of a face-to-face exchange. Rudy Giuliani Second, there has been much press speculation about my own interactions with Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. To the best of my recollection, I met Mr. Giuliani in person only once at a reception when I briefly shook his hand in 2016. This was before I became Ambassador to the EU. In contrast, during my time as Ambassador, I do not recall having ever met with Mr. Giuliani in person, and I only spoke with him a few times. Ambassador Volker introduced me to Mr. Giuliani electronically. My best recollection is that I spoke with Mr. Giuliani for the first time in early August 2019, after the congratulatory phone call from President Trump on July 25, 2019 and after the bilateral meeting with President Zelensky on July 26, 2019 in Kiev. My recollection is that Mr. Giuliani and I actually spoke no more than two or three times by phone, for about a few minutes each time. As I stated earlier, I understood from President Trump, at the May 23, 2019 White House debriefing, that he wanted the Inaugural Delegation to talk with Mr. Giuliani concerning our efforts to arrange a White House meeting for President Zelensky. Taking direction from the President, as I must, I spoke with Mr. Giuliani for that limited purpose. In these short conversations, Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anticorruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anticorruption investigatory topics of importance for the President. Let me be clear: Mr. Giuliani does not work for me or my Mission and I do not know what official or unofficial role, if any, he has with the State Department. To my knowledge, he is one of the President\u2019s personal lawyers. However, my understanding was that the President directed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s participation, that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the President, and that Mr. Giuliani had already spoken with Secretary Perry and Ambassador Volker. Ten weeks after the President on May 23, 2019 directed the Inaugural Delegation to talk with Mr. Giuliani, I had my first phone conversation with him in early August 2019. I listened to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s concerns. My goal was the keep the focus on Ukraine and the strengthened relationship with the United States. Please know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters. However, given the President\u2019s explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed Former Vice President Biden/Hunter Biden Third, given many inaccurate press reports, let me be clear about the following: I do not recall that Mr. Giuliani discussed Former Vice President Biden or his son Hunter Biden with me. Like many of you, I read the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call for the first time when it was released publicly by the White House on September 25, 2019. Although Mr. Giuliani did mention the name \u201cBurisma\u201d in August 2019, I understood that Burisma was one of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies. I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. Again, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens. NSC/Ambassador Bolton Fourth, I worked hard to keep the National Security Council, including Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill, apprised of our Ukrainian efforts. In fact, sometime in June 2019, Secretary Perry organized a conference call with Ambassador Bolton, Ambassador Volker, myself, and others. We went over the entire Ukraine strategy with Ambassador Bolton, who agreed with the strategy and signed off on it. Indeed, over the spring and summer of 2019, I received nothing but cordial responses from Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill. Nothing was ever raised to me about any concerns regarding our Ukrainian policy. While I have not seen Dr. Hill\u2019s testimony, I am surprised and disappointed by the media reports of her critical comments. To put it clearly: Neither she nor Ambassador Bolton shared any critical comments with me, even after our July 10, 2019 White House meeting. And so, I have to view her testimony \u2014 if the media reports are accurate \u2014 as the product of hindsight and in the context of the widely known tensions between the NSC, on the one hand, and the State Department, on the other hand, which had ultimate responsibility for executing U.S. policy overseas. Again, I took my direction from Secretary Pompeo and have had his consistent support in dealing with our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets to this very day. Stop Texting Fifth, certain media outlets have misinterpreted my text messages where I say \u201cstop texting\u201d or \u201ccall me.\u201d Any implication that I was trying to avoid making a record of our conversation is completely false. In my view, diplomacy is best handled through back-and-forth conversation. The complexity of international relations cannot be adequately expressed in cryptic text messages. I simply prefer to talk rather than to text. I do this all the time with family, friends, and former business associates. That is how I most effectively get things done. My text message comments were an invitation to talk more, not to conceal the substance of our communications. Withholding Security Assistance Sixth, to the best of my recollection, I do not recall any discussions with the White House on withholding U.S. security assistance from Ukraine in return for assistance with the President\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. I recall that, in late July 2019, Ambassadors Volker and Taylor and I exchanged emails in which we all agreed that President Zelensky should have no involvement in 2020 U.S. Presidential election politics. At the same time, we all believed strongly that U.S. Security Assistance should not be withheld. On September 9, 2019, Acting Charge de Affairs/Ambassador William Taylor raised concerns about the possibility that Ukrainians could perceive a linkage between U.S. security assistance and the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. Taking the issue seriously, and given the many versions of speculation that had been circulating about the security aid, I called President Trump directly. I asked the President: \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d The President responded, \u201cNothing. There is no quid pro quo.\u201d The President repeated: \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood. I tried hard to address Ambassador Taylor\u2019s concerns because he is a valuable and effective diplomat and I took very seriously the issues he raised. I did not want Ambassador Taylor to leave his post and generate even more turnover in the Ukraine mission. I further encouraged Ambassador Taylor to contact Secretary Pompeo, as I followed up as far as I could go. As you have seen in the press, my contemporaneous messages support my recollection. Let me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings. In my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason. CONCLUSION Simply put, my goal has always been to advance U.S. interests in securing a strong relationship with Ukraine. I continue to see our relationship with President Zelensky as having great importance to national security, and I continue to work to strengthen our ties, advance our mutual interests, and secure a stable, prosperous Ukraine for future generations. I will end my remarks the same way I began: Ukraine is not a dirty word. Ukraine is a fragile democracy fighting against a brutal and unscrupulous Russian neighbor. A strong Ukraine helps to uphold the norms that maintain stability and promote prosperity around the world. It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their Ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to going back to work tomorrow to advance the interests of the United States of America.",

We\u2019ll send a special edition of this newsletter Sunday if news warrants. Otherwise, we\u2019ll publish as usual on Monday. Read the full story. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen pulled out five key passages from Yovanovitch\u2019s 10-page opening statement and put some context around them. Check out his full piece or read the selections below. \u2026unfounded and false claims\u2026 \u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the US government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d I do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me. \u201cWith respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contacts with him \u2013 a total of three that I recall. None related to the events at issue. I do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me. But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d \u2026 come back to Washington from Ukraine on the next plane. \u201c\u2026after being asked by the Department in early March to extend my tour until 2020, I was then abruptly told in late April to come back to Washington from Ukraine on the next plane.\u201d \u2026 this was not like other situations\u2026 \u201cI met with the Deputy Secretary of State, who informed me of the curtailment of my term. He said that the President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018. He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d \u2026take action now to defend this great institution\u2026 \u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within. State Department leadership, with Congress, needs to take action now to defend this great institution, and its thousands of loyal and effective employees. We need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America\u2019s interests and the front line of America\u2019s defense. I fear that not doing so will harm our nation\u2019s interest, perhaps irreparably.\u201d This impeachment story arguably started years ago, with protests in Ukraine in 2014 that toppled the government there, angering Vladimir Putin, who invaded Crimea. Here\u2019s how that set off a chain of events that ultimately triggered the current investigation. The Trump administration is keen on rewriting the rules of justice as they pertain to the President. But the all-powerful untouchable executive strategy was checked by a judge overseeing a case involving Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2013 which he, breaking previous presidential precedent, has refused to release. A panel of federal judges in DC ruled Trump\u2019s accounting firm must turn over his tax records to a House committee. They also suggested Trump\u2019s argument against the legality of the impeachment inquiry is seriously flawed. \u201cThe fact that the subpoena in this case seeks information that concerns the President of the United States adds a twist, but not a surprising one,\u201d the majority wrote. There will certainly be an appeal. Judge Neomi Rao wrote a dissent and previewed the fight that could be coming to a Supreme Court near you when she warned that Congress could become \u201ca roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government.\u201d Republicans continue to contort themselves during interactions with reporters as they try to avoid either condoning or condemning Trump\u2019s behavior. Yesterday we pointed out the incredible stamina of Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner in not answering whether it was appropriate for a president to invite foreign election influence. Today, Marco Rubio, clarified on Twitter that when Rubio said he didn\u2019t think Trump was being serious by asking China to investigate Biden, he was not suggesting Trump was kidding. Rubio\u2019s tweet: \u201cSome taking liberty of reporting I said Trump was \u2018joking\u2019 or \u2018kidding\u2019 about Biden & China I said wasn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d request. Stand by it 100%. Disagree? Find use of \u2018joking\u2019 or \u2018kidding\u2019 in my statement Describe what potential legal consequences this poses for Biden or son\u201d Giuliani and Trump \u2013 The President is now expressing concerns about Giuliani\u2019s ties to the Ukrainians arrested this week. According to CNN\u2019s White House team, Trump is not happy with coverage on television \u2013 but Giuliani is still his lawyer, but a source tells CNN\u2019s Pam Brown that he\u2019s no longer working on Ukraine. Trump and the Bidens and China \u2013 Trump repeated his attacks on Hunter Biden during a rally in Minneapolis Thursday, again accusing Joe Biden\u2019s son of wrongdoing in China. Full fact check Trade deal with China \u2013 In Washington after a meeting with the Chinese Vice Premier Friday, Trump said he did not bring up his public request for China to investigate Biden during trade talks. The US and China moved toward a mini trade agreement Friday ahead of scheduled tariff increases next week. Republican supports impeachment inquiry \u2013 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan joins the very few elected Republicans who support an impeachment inquiry. HR McMaster weighs in \u2013 Trump\u2019s former national security adviser  said it is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d appropriate for a president to ask other countries to interfere in the political process of the US. The Vienna connection - Rudy Giuliani told Elaina Plott of the Atlantic he was supposed to be en route to Vienna on Thursday night. That\u2019s the same city his two arrested associates were bound for when they were detained at the airport. Help for Giuliani clients \u2013 The Post and the Times report that Trump tried during an Oval Office meeting to get his former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to find a diplomatic deal to benefit a Turkish-Iranian gold dealer who was being prosecuted by the US and who was represented by Giuliani. Smoke and mirrors \u2013 Trump had this WSJ Op-Ed on Ukraine by Kimberley Strassel, with the headline \u201cSmoke and Mirrors\u201d sent to every Republican senator. Guest host and CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto talked to former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers about how Trump\u2019s political problem might become a criminal problem with this week\u2019s arrests. Listen here. Here are the planned/possible witnesses scheduled to appear before Congress next week: The House committees have also requested to talk to top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor. The President has invited foreign powers to interfere in the US presidential election. Democrats want to impeach him for it. It is a crossroads for the American system of government as the President tries to change what\u2019s acceptable for US politicians.

            "article_content": "House Democrats on Monday expanded their impeachment inquiry with subpoenas to the Pentagon and Office of Management and Budget tied to the freezing of foreign aid to Ukraine. The newest subpoenas broaden the House\u2019s impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine into new corners of the federal government. They follow subpoenas that have already been issued to the State Department and White House, as well as the President\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, as Democrats seek to rapidly gather information as they consider whether to impeach the President. The committees have also requested information from Vice President Mike Pence as part of the probe. The subpoenas to the Pentagon and OMB are related to the decision to hold up foreign aid to Ukraine, which came at the same time that Giuliani and Trump were pushing for Ukraine to launch an investigation into the 2016 US election, then-Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing in relation to Ukraine by the Bidens. LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Trump impeachment inquiry \u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the Committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u201d the chairmen wrote. New twists put Republicans on spot in impeachment saga It\u2019s not clear how the agencies will respond to the subpoenas. The State Department missed a Friday deadline to turn over documents that Democrats\u2019 subpoenaed, and the White House has indicated that it will not comply with the subpoena issued on Friday, arguing that the House needs to first take a full vote on authorizing an impeachment inquiry. Last week, however, the Pentagon\u2019s chief legal officer requested that Defense Department agencies identify, preserve and collect any and all documents relating to the provision of security assistance to Kiev. More subpoenas could be on the way, too. Democrats have requested information from three Giuliani associates \u2014 Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman who worked with Giuliani; Igor Fruman, a business partner of Parnas; and Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin, a former aide to Giuliani \u2014 and they\u2019re warning they will subpoena three Giuliani associates if they do not comply with their requests for documents and depositions. They have not cooperated so far, a source said. Two were supposed to testify at the end of this week and another next week. And the deadline to turn over documents is Monday. \u201cWhile we have engaged with counsels for these witnesses, they have so far refused to agree to testify or turn over relevant documents - if they continue to fail to comply, they will be served with subpoenas in short order,\u201d an official working on the impeachment inquiry said. John Dowd, who is representing Parnas and Fruman, wrote in a letter to the committees that some of the information they\u2019re seeking is protected by attorney-client privilege, and a review of the material cannot be conducted in just the week given to comply with the request. He said he expected to meet with them this week and review the documents requested, but said that responding to the committees \u201cwill take some time.\u201d \u201cYour request for documents and communications is overly broad and unduly burdensome. The subject matter of your requests is well beyond the scope of your inquiry,\u201d Dowd wrote. \u201cThis, in combination with requiring immediate responses, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Democratic committee members\u2019 intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 investigation stems from a whistleblower alleging the President solicited help from Ukraine to investigate a political rival in his July 25 call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint also notes that foreign aid to Ukraine had been suspended around the same time. The aid was subsequently released by the Trump administration in September, but Democrats are now probing the reasons is was held up in the first place. In text messages provided by former US special envoy Kurt Volker to Congress last week, senior US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor expressed alarm that aid was being frozen, suggesting it was tied to the request for an investigation into Biden. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor texted US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland on September 1. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted a week later. Sondland responded to Taylor\u2019s second text that he was \u201cincorrect\u201d about Trump\u2019s intentions. \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d But the texts show how the Ukrainians\u2019 efforts to secure a meeting between Trump and Zelensky was in fact linked to the opening of an investigation ahead of the July 25 phone call. Sondland appears behind closed doors before the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees on Tuesday. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is hardly acting like a very stable genius. Instead, his unleashed fury, fact-bending rants and persecution complex are conjuring an image of someone seeing his presidency slipping through his hands. While current political conditions seem unlikely to lead to his ouster from office, Trump appears increasingly powerless to save himself from the historical scar of impeachment. He has crushed just about every norm since descending his golden escalator to launch his 2016 presidential campaign. Now he\u2019s reinventing how presidents deal with an existential scandal. And it seems to be leading him deeper into the darkness. After a day of poor media reviews for his unrestrained tirades on Wednesday, Trump became even angrier on Thursday \u2013 calling on Communist China to open an investigation into Joe Biden \u2013  a potential 2020 general election opponent. Trump's private fury over impeachment spills into the public \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said at the White House. In effect, the President was publicly calling on a US adversary to investigate a prominent American citizen who is a political opponent \u2013 the same request he made in private to Ukraine\u2019s President \u2013 that prompted House Democrats to launch an impeachment investigation. There is no evidence that Joe Biden received money from China. But a company that retained his son Hunter on its board, received a large investment of Chinese capital shortly after he visited the country with his father, though a lawyer for Hunter Biden has pushed back on Trump\u2019s characterization calling it \u201ca gross misrepresentation.\u201d The Biden campaign has said the President\u2019s behavior was an abuse of power motivated by panic that the former vice president would \u201cbeat him like a drum\u201d in 2020. Part of Trump\u2019s frustration may stem from the unusual nature of his current plight. Since taking office, Trump has kept Washington hopping, with his adversaries never knowing what wild gyration will rock the capital next. But in the week since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally initiated impeachment hearings, the President has seemed out of sorts. It is the Democrats who are doing all the running, and Trump can\u2019t catch up. \u201cWe are not fooling around,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff warned on Monday, in a grave news conference with Pelosi that contrasted with Trump\u2019s fireworks and turned on complex constitutional justifications for the Democrats\u2019 decision to seek the President\u2019s impeachment. The painful truth for Trump is that the machinery of impeachment is grinding on, and there is not much he can do about it. Convention suggests that Trump should ignore the storm and get on, like Bill Clinton did when impeachment threatened, to do the work of the American people. A President on thin ice ought to avoid any public behavior that deepens his jeopardy. That\u2019s not Trump\u2019s way. In a pair of combustible public appearances Wednesday \u2013 alongside the unfortunate Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 \u2013 Trump, as he always does, met a crisis with all guns blazing. The President bickered bitterly with reporters, mocked his enemies with juvenile nicknames, twisted the facts of his own conduct and bemoaned how unfairly he\u2019d been treated. His unhinged mood was encapsulated in an encounter between the President and Jeff Mason of Reuters, one of the most down-the-line and courteous reporters in Washington. Mason wanted to know the answer to the question that Trump refuses to address and that is at the center of the impeachment storm. What did he want from Ukraine\u2019s President if it was not, as it appears from a transcript of their July 25 telephone call, dirt on his potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden? When Mason, repeatedly but respectfully tried to follow up, Trump snapped: \u201cAsk this gentleman a question. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax, and you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,\u201d the President added. For all of the tantrums and feuds and demagoguery and fury, it still shocks to see a President conducting himself this way, against the backdrop of the golden curtains of the East Room, scene of some of the most solemn, and decorous occasions in the history of the White House. Trump's private fury over impeachment spills into the public When not raging, the President was feeling sorry for himself. \u201cThe political storm, I\u2019ve lived with it from the day I got elected,\u201d he told a Finnish reporter, who drew gasps when she asked what favors he\u2019d demanded from his visitor \u2013 a backhanded reference to his attempt to get Ukraine to play in the 2020 election. \u201cI have done more and this administration has done more than any administration in the history of this country in the first two-and-a-half years,\u201d Trump said, though the presidents whose portraits stare down at him in the White House every day might have begged to differ. \u201cI\u2019m used to it. For me it\u2019s like putting on a suit in the morning,\u201d Trump said of the tsunami of political disruption to which he has subjected the nation for nearly three years. In another comment that will astound the historians of the future, Trump tweeted on Wednesday that Democrats were wasting America\u2019s time with \u201cBULLSHIT.\u201d Accusing Schiff of treason, which he did several times on Wednesday, without offering any credible justification for accusing a fellow American of this most heinous of crimes, is unlikely to deflect House Democrats from their process. Nor will the President\u2019s arguments that Schiff is making up details of conduct that are laid out in the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s President that he released himself. \u201cBelieve it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I am a very stable genius,\u201d Trump said, though his furious mood seemed to suggest exactly the opposite. In the most significant development in the inquiry on Wednesday, Schiff \u2013 who has been mocked repeatedly by Trump \u2013 warned that White House efforts to stop witnesses from testifying would be deemed obstruction, hinting that any such behavior could be folded into articles of impeachment. Trump is effectively being constrained, a novel and uncomfortable position for a businessman, a reality star and an unlikely politician who resists all kinds of control. All his life, Trump has called the shots and he\u2019s always forced others to respond to his impulses. It\u2019s not surprising he\u2019s frustrated when the shoe is on the other foot. Subscribe to CNN\u2019s \u201cMeanwhile in America\u201d newsletter by clicking here. The President is also finding that his normal bag of tricks \u2013 denial of established reality, searing personal attacks on his foes and constant distraction and disruption \u2013 are not working. Still, the impeachment drive is only one week old. Democrats have had the narrative mostly their way so far since institutionally they get to call the shots, leaving the administration no choice but to respond. The White House has an incentive to make the impeachment standoff drag on as long as possible, in order to test the patience of the American people and to frustrate Democratic hopes that a swift process will keep a focus on Trump\u2019s behavior. It could do that with questionable executive privilege claims or by fighting Democratic subpoenas in cases that could mushroom into lengthy legal battles that drag on for months. While Trump appears almost certain to be impeached by House Democrats given the capital they have already sunk into the process, there\u2019s little sign yet that Republican support for the President is fading in a way likely to convince 20 Senate Republicans to desert him and build a two-thirds majority that would convict him in any Senate impeachment trial. It has been noticeable however that apart from his core of loyalists, such as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Trump\u2019s  personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, there\u2019s hardly been a parade of GOP lawmakers coming out in full-throated defense of the President. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Jamie Gangel reported that there is concern in the Republican Party both about the kind of behavior that Trump exhibited Wednesday and about what could happen next. \u201cHe\u2019s taking it upon himself to tweet about every shiny object, that\u2019s not helpful right now,\u201d a source involved in Senate discussions told CNN. Sources in the administration and on Capitol Hill said that Trump\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d defense, which helped him build a political redoubt during the Russia investigation, is not serving him well now, and the President is yet to realize it. Given Trump\u2019s mood, there must be some question as to whether he will seek to disrupt the impeachment probe in a way that could deepen his constitutional jeopardy. Niinist\u00f6 seemed to be thinking along those lines, when he told the President: \u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Mike Pompeo gave a very evasive answer when asked about the Ukraine call \u201cI was on the phone call,\u201d Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy\u2019s foreign minister, hours before the State Department\u2019s inspector general\u2019s \u201curgent\u201d private briefing he requested with senior congressional staff members about documents related to the Ukraine scandal. The phone call was part of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that alleged Trump sought \u201cto solicit interference\u201d from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper. Pompeo\u2019s remarks on Wednesday was the first time the top US diplomat confirmed that he was on the July call between Trump and Zelensky \u2014 after previously evading questions on what he knew about the conversation and news reports from Monday that revealed he was on the call. During the news conference Wednesday, Pompeo was asked if he heard anything on the call that gave him any concerns or raised a red flag, but he dodged the question. \u201cThe phone call was in the context of \u2013 now I guess I\u2019ve been secretary of state for coming on a year and a half. I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It\u2019s been remarkably consistent, and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s what our team, including Ambassador (Kurt) Volker, were focused on was taking down the threat that Russia poses there in Ukraine. It was about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government and to help now this new government in the Ukraine build a successful thriving economy. It\u2019s what the State Department officials that I\u2019ve had the privilege to lead have been engaged in. And it\u2019s what we will continue to do. Even while all this noise is going on.\u201d The Wall Street Journal first reported \u2013 and CNN confirmed \u2013 that Pompeo was on the call with Trump and Zelensky, where Trump asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2013 investigate Biden, a 2020 candidate for the Democratic nomination, and his son, Hunter Biden. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Pompeo was asked about the whistleblower complaint last week while in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, but he said at the time he had not yet read it in full. He gave a similar answer to ABC News during a September 22 interview, where he was asked what he knew about the conversation. \u201cYou just gave me a report about a (intelligence community) whistleblower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Pompeo told ABC News at the time. The whistleblower complaint led House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Late last week, Pompeo was subpoenaed by the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees over his failure to produce documents related to Ukraine. In addition to the subpoena, the chairmen informed Pompeo in a separate letter that they had scheduled depositions for five State Department officials who have been mentioned in relation to the inquiry. Pompeo had responded Tuesday that the proposed timetable for witnesses to testify in the coming days was too compressed, and Democrats warned Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress \u201cis illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d In Rome Wednesday, Pompeo said he objected to the demands that \u201cdeeply violate fundamental principles of separation of powers,\u201d saying that the House Democrats had directly contacted the five officials and told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department. \u201cWe will, of course, do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co-equal branch,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cBut we are going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system. And we won\u2019t tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees. That\u2019s unacceptable, and it\u2019s not something that I\u2019m going to permit to happen.\u201d This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "For Rudy Giuliani, the final week of September could very well go down as the most consequential stretch of days in his long public career since he led New York City through the tragedy of 9/11. Things started benignly enough. On Friday night, September 20, the President\u2019s personal attorney attended a black-tie state dinner at the White House, smiling for cameras alongside his girlfriend Maria Ryan. Yet a week later, Giuliani was under siege, and at the heart of events that have led to the first formal impeachment inquiry into a president in 20 years. In between, Giuliani conducted a one-man messaging war, going on Fox News at least four times, talking to numerous reporters, and sending more than 50 tweets, many of which were about Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their alleged dealings in Ukraine. It was a surreal climax for Giuliani\u2019s 10-month, quixotic mission aimed at proving his theory that the origins of the investigation into Russian election interference can be traced back to Democrats\u2019 dealings in Ukraine. Along the way he went to Warsaw, Madrid, and very nearly Ukraine. He met with foreign nationals, coordinated with US State Department officials, dropped vague, confusing accusations in cable-TV appearances, and ceaselessly pitched US journalists on what he claims is one of the biggest scandals in modern American history\u2014 all while whispering in Donald Trump\u2019s ear about how Ukraine contained the keys to revealing truths about the President\u2019s political rivals. Giuliani previews potential 2020 attack dog role with Biden-Ukraine story The loose, slipshod strategy was designed to push a counternarrative about the true origins of the Russian investigation. (Stirring up trouble for Biden was an added benefit.) Instead, in a dizzying reversal, Giuliani\u2019s actions boomeranged back on the President this week with stunning speed. By Friday, not only were Trump and Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine dealings the focus of the impeachment inquiry, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been subpoenaed and the top US diplomat to Ukraine had resigned. Giuliani himself now faces the prospect of being in the crosshairs of the House\u2019s impeachment investigation. Speaking Friday with CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto, Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, did not rule out calling on Giuliani to testify or even subpoenaing him. \u201cI obviously have several questions for him,\u201d Quigley said. Giuliani said he would not testify without consulting his client, Trump, and that testimony about his work for the President should be protected by attorney-client privilege. \u201cUltimately, if I were to say yes and he were to say no, I can\u2019t testify,\u201d Giuliani told CNN Friday. Not long after, news broke that he had told Sky News essentially the opposite that he would in fact testify. Asked if he was concerned he would be subpoenaed by the House, Giuliani laughed. \u201cI consider them a joke. A sad joke. They have no legitimacy. I would think of challenging their subpoena on the grounds that they\u2019re not a legitimate committee,\u201d Giuliani said. Through it all, Giuliani has put up a defiant front. \u201cWhat they should be doing is giving me an award for uncovering something that when it\u2019s looked back on, someone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Why were you all asleep?\u2019\u201d he told CNN Thursday. Giuliani\u2019s role in Ukraine can be traced back to November 2018, when he was contacted by someone he describes as a \u201cwell-known investigator\u201d who connected him with a Ukrainian-American businessman in Florida named Lev Parnas. Through Parnas, who did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment, Giuliani began speaking with multiple Ukrainian nationals about information about two subjects of interest to his client, President Trump. The first regarded what Giuliani has described as collusion between Democrats and Ukraine during the 2016 election. The second is the claim that Vice President Biden had pressured Ukraine to halt an investigation connected to his own son. One of the people Giuliani says he spoke with in December 2018, over Skype, was Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general. In 2016, Biden was among multiple Western leaders who successfully urged Ukraine to dismiss Shokin from the country\u2019s top prosecutor position, citing his insufficient work to root out corruption. But Shokin told Giuliani a different story: that he was pushed out to stop an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company that included Hunter Biden as a compensated board member. That story is littered with holes, and neither Giuliani nor anyone else has provided any evidence of actual wrongdoing by Biden or his son. \u201cNot one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,\u201d Biden said Friday. \u201cNot one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president.\u201d There is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever under investigation. According to a report from Bloomberg, the Ukrainian government\u2019s case against Burisma had been \u201cdormant\u201d since 2014, two years before Shokin was dismissed at Biden\u2019s urging. Furthermore, Biden was also joined in his anti-corruption push against the prosecutor by numerous leaders in Europe as well as the International Monetary Fund \u2013 none of whom had any family ties to Burisma. But the idea intrigued Giuliani. \u201cI said, \u2018Holy sh*t, what\u2019s that all about?\u2019\u201d he told CNN earlier this year. Giuliani kept pursuing both stories, the Biden allegations and the so-called collusion in the 2016 election. Giuliani says he twice met with Shokin\u2019s successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko \u2013 in New York in January 2019, then in Warsaw in February. Giuliani told CNN he learned more about both cases from Lutsenko, and that he also heard about Lutsenko\u2019s dissatisfaction with the US ambassador\u2019s supposed request that he drop certain prosecutions. In an April interview with the Babel, a Ukrainian news outlet, Lutsenko confirmed this account of their conversations. According to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, Giuliani\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian officials prompted concern among US officials about the \u201ccircumvention of national security decision-making processes.\u201d Indeed, Giuliani\u2019s actions alarmed a number of career State Department officials, prompting some of them to keep distance between their work and his, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Specifically, they worried that being involved with his efforts would mean they were acting with a partisan political agenda, which as career foreign service officers they were not permitted to do. Giuliani told CNN this week he never heard about any of those concerns. \u201cIf they were going to get upset about this, they should have gotten upset about it in January or February,\u201d he said. But there were limits to Giuliani\u2019s freelance diplomacy, and it turns out Lutsenko was hardly a reliable source of information. That\u2019s partly due to the fact that Lutsenko\u2019s hold on power was precarious following Ukraine\u2019s April presidential election. Lutsenko may also have had ulterior motives for pushing the Biden conspiracy with Giuliani. The transition between presidents in Ukraine meant that his job as prosecutor general was in jeopardy, and having a line to a close adviser to the US President was a good way to stay relevant. Indeed, Lutsenko would end up backing off some of his claims that Giuliani worked to amplify, including that his office was reopening its investigation into Burisma and Biden. Lutsenko would leave his position as prosecutor general on August 29. The public first got wind of Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine actions in May, when press reports, including one in the New York Times, described  how Giuliani was promoting allegations about Biden and Burisma. At the time, Giuliani told reporters, including CNN, that he was planning to travel to Ukraine to gather more information. Within a day of reports of his trip however, Giuliani canceled, telling CNN he was concerned that President-elect Zelensky had advisers around him who were \u201cvery vocal opponents of President Trump and peculiarly vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton\u201d and that his trip would have accomplished little. From there, the story faded from public view, but Giuliani kept working behind the scenes. A crucial development came on July 19, when Giuliani says the State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, offered to place him in touch with one of Zelensky\u2019s top advisers, Andriy Yermak. At about the same time, Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine. Trump has denied his decision to delay the aid had anything to do with his desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden. Over the next two weeks, Giuliani told CNN he spoke with Yermak at least two times on the phone. He also said he reported back to Volker and the State Department on his conversations with Yermak. A readers' guide to fact-checking Trump's Ukraine controversy According to the whistleblower complaint, \u201cmultiple officials\u201d told the whistleblower that Ukrainian officials were \u201cled to believe that a meeting or phone call between\u201d Trump and Zelensky would depend on Zelensky\u2019s willingness to \u201cplay ball\u201d on the cases raised by Giuliani. Several days after the July 25 call, Giuliani told CNN he met with Yermak in person in Madrid on August 1. After their meeting, Giuliani told CNN that he called Volker to relay the message he\u2019d gotten from Yermak\u2014 that Zelensky was ridding himself of \u201cleftovers and bad actors.\u201d \u201cI relayed back to him that I thought the guy was straight,\u201d Giuliani told CNN. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint claims US officials characterized the August Madrid meeting as a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Giuliani told CNN he was not aware that his August 1 meeting with Yermak was intended to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Giuliani claimed he was unaware that Zelensky and Trump had brought his name up. He also said he never spoke with Trump about his meetings with Yermak. Giuliani claimed to CNN that he was not aware that he had been brought up in the July 25 phone call. By Tuesday night, Giuliani was texting and calling with CNN, mocking House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement about the impeachment inquiry. Minutes later, he was on Fox News, echoing his claim to CNN that he had a phone full of text messages proving that he was acting at the behest of US officials. \u201cI never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it,\u201d he told Laura Ingraham Tuesday. The next morning, the White House released the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, and Giuliani was relatively quiet and unresponsive to text messages from CNN. But on Thursday, however, things ramped up again. The whistleblower complaint was released and the acting Director of National Intelligence was at a hearing in front the House Intelligence Committee. And it put Giuliani in full-attack mode. Included in the complaint was the whistleblower\u2019s claim that two State Department officials had spoken to Giuliani to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d he was doing to US national security interests regarding his work with Ukraine \u2013 something Giuliani strongly disputed. \u201cAt no time did either one of them say they wanted to contain damage,\u201d Giuliani told CNN. \u201cAt no time did the State Department in communication with me ever relay any of that information you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Again, Giuliani went out of his way on the phone to CNN to point out that he had been in touch with Volker, telling CNN he had a \u201cnice little trail\u201d of text message conversations with Volker that would prove the State Department was fully aware of his actions regarding Ukraine. But by now, the damage was done. Giuliani\u2019s involvement was enough not only to help prompt the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry but to raise the possibility he could be a witness. Events began to move very quickly by Friday afternoon. News first broke that House Democrats had subpoenaed Pompeo. A few hours later, Volker resigned from his post as the top diplomat to Ukraine. Giuliani\u2019s defense of himself \u2013 that his Ukraine work had the blessing of the State Department \u2013 was already causing heads to roll. The 75-year-old former mayor, speaking with CNN Friday, was practically sanguine about this last development. \u201cHe seemed like a very knowledgeable guy to me,\u201d said Giuliani, when asked about Volker\u2019s departure. \u201cAnd a decent guy.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Lawyers for a whistleblower who accused Donald Trump of pressuring Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 election warn that the President\u2019s threats pose a grave risk to their client\u2019s safety. Trump meanwhile escalated his attacks on the whistleblower \u2013 demanding to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d face to face during a day of rage-filled tweets about the Democratic attempt to impeach him. The President\u2019s anger spilled over during a day of rage-filled tweets Sunday in which he selectively quoted a supporter who said he was afraid of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d in the country if Trump is forced from office. The extraordinary spectacle of the President \u2013 the titular head of the US legal system \u2013 threatening a potential witness in a case against him risks being seen as an attempt to obstruct the investigation. It also cuts against the principle that whistleblowers deserve anonymity and protection, representing another dark twist in an administration that has constantly tested the boundaries of political propriety. Trump says he wants to meet whistleblower: 'I deserve to meet my accuser' On another frenetic day of political exchanges, Democrats sought to engineer a fast start to their impeachment efforts as their chances of political success hinge on early momentum to keep the White House off balance. Trump however led a ferocious fight back over the weekend, lashing out at Democrats, the media and the whistleblower as some of his top allies battled through a series of contentious appearances on Sunday talk shows. On Sunday night, it emerged that lawyers for the whistleblower wrote to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to express \u201cserious concerns\u201d for their client. \u201cThe events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client\u2019s identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm\u2019s way,\u201d the lawyers wrote in a letter date Saturday, September 28, before directly citing a comment by Trump last week.  On that occasion, the President said the person that gave the whistleblower the information was \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and hinted at the possibility of execution for such behavior. The lawyers noted that Trump was not referring directly to the whistleblower, but said that fact did not assuage their concerns and alleged that several unnamed parties had offered a $50,000 bounty for information on their client\u2019s identity. \u201cUnfortunately, we expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter,\u201d the lawyers wrote in a letter obtained by CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown. The letter from the lawyers emerged after House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff Sunday said he had reached a deal to secure testimony from the whistleblower. An attorney for the whistleblower said discussions were continuing. Trump, meanwhile, kept up his bid to discredit the whistleblower. \u201cI want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u201cWhistleblower.\u201d Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. The President also called for Schiff to be questioned for fraud and treason. Trump also tweeted about the \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d comment by Robert Jeffress, a supporter on Fox News, prompting Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger to offer a rebuke. \u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted. The White House, which seemed caught off guard in a wild week that saw House Speaker Nancy Pelosi open the impeachment inquiry, hit back hard in a bid to discredit allegations that the President abused his power by seeking dirt from Ukraine on a potential 2020 opponent, Joe Biden. \u201cThe President of the United States is the whistleblower,\u201d senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cAnd this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,\u201d he said, blasting the complaint as a \u201clittle Nancy Drew novel.\u201d But Pelosi told her caucus on a conference call Sunday that they should try to be non-partisan about the impeachment process. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics.  It\u2019s not about partisanship.  It\u2019s about patriotism,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that this has anything to do with whether you like (Trump) or not \u2013 forget that.  That\u2019s about the election. This is about the Constitution.\u201d The speedy escalation of the political war was remarkable, given that it is only a week since Schiff declared Trump had \u201ccrossed the Rubicon\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats and the White House are now locked in a historic confrontation that will test the US political system to its limits and will shape the destiny of the 2020 election. Democrats are under pressure to produce a concise impeachment probe that keeps a tight focus on Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing and makes a clear case to Americans. To that end, Pelosi has made Schiff the primary face of the investigation after a Judiciary Committee hearing with Trump\u2019s ex-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski this month turned into a farce. Speed is important because a failure to decide whether the full House will vote on Articles of Impeachment within months could overshadow Democratic primaries when the party\u2019s candidates hope to be talking about health care and economic inequality \u2013 issues that preoccupy voters \u2013 rather than Trump. Still, any sign that Democrats are rushing could play into GOP claims that they have decided to impeach the President wherever the evidence leads.  While Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict Trump in a Senate trial, Democrats hope to persuade general election voters he\u2019s unfit for office and to heap pressure on GOP Senate candidates in swing states who may not relish a vote to acquit Trump. But the longer Trump can drag the impeachment intrigue out, the better it may be for his political fortunes. With time, he can crank up efforts to discredit the impeachment probe with the help of the conservative media machine - a tactic that worked well in shaping perceptions of the Mueller probe. The President will also seek to change the subject \u2013 perhaps with big ticket foreign policy goals that could bolster his argument that he\u2019s doing the people\u2019s business and should not be impeached. The White House will also likely make expansive executive privilege claims and fight in court to frustrate Democrats and build public frustration with the impeachment saga. And the President can put claims that Democrats are trying to subvert the result of the 2016 election at the center of his rallies to fire up his loyal supporters as 2020 approaches. As the pace heats up in Washington, former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker \u2014 who resigned last week \u2014 plans to appear for a deposition before three House committees on Thursday. Volker is a long-time Republican foreign policy hand who was close to late Sen. John McCain \u2014 the most prominent GOP critic of the President. This could be a wild card moment for the White House, which may seek to exert privilege over the ambassador\u2019s dealings with Ukraine on behalf of Trump. Schiff said Sunday that he also expects the whistleblower to testify \u201cvery soon\u201d following negotiations focusing partly on how to preserve his or her anonymity and security. \u201cWe will get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d he said on ABC News \u201cThis Week.\u201d CNN reported on Wednesday the potential testimony is dependent on the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys getting security clearances. In the complaint, judged credible by a Trump-appointed intelligence community inspector general, the whistleblower alleged the President tried to get Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and the White House tried to cover it up. Trump has repeatedly denied that he did anything wrong, saying his call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect.\u201d He has also dismissed allegations he threatened to withhold US military aid to Ukraine if Kiev refused to investigate Biden. Trump supporters were out in force on the Sunday talk shows. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, in a contentious exchange with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d tried to make the issue about Biden and his son Hunter who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm when his father was vice president. \u201cWhen the company that\u2019s paying that money is under investigation, guess what? Daddy comes running to the rescue. The vice president of the United States comes running in and says, \u2018Fire that prospector,\u2019\u201d Jordan said. Tapper replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened. Sir, sir, that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d adding that the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and activists in Ukraine all wanted the prosecutor dismissed because he was not pursuing corruption. There is no evidence that Biden or his son did anything wrong. There was one note of criticism for Trump from an unexpected quarter on Sunday. Tom Bossert, who served as White House homeland security chief, faulted the President\u2019s handling of Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m deeply disturbed by it as well and this entire mess has me frustrated,\u201d Bossert, now an ABC contributor, told \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI hope that everyone can sift through the evidence and be very careful, as I\u2019ve seen a lot of rush to judgment this week. That said, it is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent.\u201d The frenzied nature of Sunday\u2019s exchanges reflected the fact that no one in Washington can really predict the political impact of the impeachment drama to come. After all, conventional wisdom on the likelihood of such a process and the wisdom of political maneuvers by Trump and Pelosi shifted several times last week. The only certainty is that Washington is entering a fraught period that could make the vitriol of the last two-and-a-half years sound like a warmup.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani appeared to contradict himself Sunday over whether he would cooperate with a House impeachment probe over the whistleblower complaint, but ultimately said he would if directed by Trump. Asked by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on \u201cThis Week\u201d if he was going to cooperate with the committee if it includes him in its probe, the former New York City mayor replied: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t cooperate with (House Intelligence Committee Chairman) Adam Schiff. I think Adam Schiff should be removed.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s your answer? You\u2019re not going to cooperate?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said I will consider it,\u201d Giuliani replied. Giuliani's journey to the center of Trump's impeachment battle started with a phone call in 2018 Pressed by Stephanopoulos on his conflicting response, Giuliani again said he would \u201cconsider it,\u201d adding that any potential action would be \u201cguided\u201d by Trump, his client. \u201cIf (Trump) decides that he wants me to testify of course I\u2019ll testify \u2013 even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate chairman,\u201d he said. Giuliani refused to commit when speaking to CNN Sunday evening to providing required documents if he is subpoenaed by Congressional investigators, and he continued to remain noncommittal on if he would comply with a subpoena. \u201cMust all be taken under consideration including my question about how a committee of Congress can be chaired by a partisan who has clearly made up his mind,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s like going before a judge who has made so many prejudicial comments about your client that it is a mockery to think he will be fair.\u201d Giuliani went on to add that Schiff should be removed from his position atop the committee. When asked if he would resist the subpoena until Schiff steps down, he wouldn\u2019t give a firm answer. \u201cThere are many privileges to work your way through including a Sixth Amendment attorney-client and attorney-work product privilege. I\u2019m not saying I will or will not. The illegitimacy of the investigation is only one and maybe not decisive,\u201d he said. When asked about Schiff\u2019s potential subpoena, Giuliani said, \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d Giuliani has become a key player in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conduct and was named 31 times in a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers \u201cto solicit interference\u201d from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper, despite a transcript released by the White House showing he repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 his potential 2020 political rival \u2013 and his son, Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Speaking Friday with CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto, Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, did not rule out calling on Giuliani to testify or even subpoenaing, saying he \u201cobviously has several questions for him.\u201d  According to a transcript released by the White House of the July 25 call between the two leaders, Zelensky told Trump that he was aware of Giuliani\u2019s efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani \u201cvery much knows what\u2019s happening.\u201d On Friday, Giuliani said he would not testify without consulting his client, Trump, and that testimony about his work for the President should be protected by attorney-client privilege. \u201cUltimately, if I were to say yes and he were to say no, I can\u2019t testify,\u201d Giuliani told CNN Friday. Not long after, news broke that he had told Sky News essentially the opposite that he would in fact testify. And asked if he was concerned he would be subpoenaed by the House, Giuliani laughed. \u201cI consider them a joke. A sad joke. They have no legitimacy. I would think of challenging their subpoena on the grounds that they\u2019re not a legitimate committee,\u201d the former mayor said. CNN\u2019s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats are developing a new plan to deal with any White House stonewalling to their upcoming demands for records and testimony: They will use it as evidence for an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump, according to sources involved in the discussions. Democrats are hoping that the tactic will force White House officials to make a choice: They could provide records to bolster the Democratic investigation, or they can resist the House subpoenas and add to the Democrats\u2019 case that Trump has sought to obstruct Congress. On Friday, three Democratic chairmen signaled their plans in the first round of subpoenas issued since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry earlier this week. \u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d the chairmen wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry for now, is focused on allegations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to initiate an investigation that he thought could benefit his reelection. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, and other Democrats are signaling they won\u2019t put up with efforts to drag out the probe, as the Trump administration has done during its other battles with Congress this year. If the Trump administration does not comply with their subpoenas and turn over records, House Democrats are considering citing that as part of an article of impeachment on defying congressional subpoenas \u2013 similar to an article against then-President Richard Nixon, Democratic sources say. Schiff is preparing for hearings, subpoenas and depositions as soon as next week as Democrats try to finish the probe this fall. When asked how he would handle any White House stonewalling, Schiff told CNN: \u201cIt\u2019ll just strengthen the case on obstruction.\u201d If the White House blocks all their requests, it may only speed up consideration of articles of impeachment, which Democrats are hoping to advance in the House as soon as this fall. \u201cIf everything we\u2019ve seen in the last few days turns out to be the case, and it seems that the President is pretty much admitting it, there is overwhelming evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors that we can act on now,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. \u201cAnd so we don\u2019t necessarily need to wait on all of the litigation.\u201d The discussions amount to a shift in strategy from how Democrats handled the fights between the Trump administration and the House Judiciary Committee, which has been investigating Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to obstruct former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. For months, the White House stymied congressional investigations with broad claims of executive privilege and absolute immunity. It blocked numerous requests for records and witness interviews, namely with former White House counsel Don McGahn, prompting the House to sue the Trump administration. Also In April, Trump summed up the strategy with the vow, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas.\u201d Those court fights have dragged on \u2013 and it\u2019s far from clear when and how they will be resolved. But Democrats believe that the latest allegations are just as serious if not more so than what the Mueller report described \u2014 and easier to understand. When asked by CNN why he supported an impeachment inquiry now, rather than months ago after the release of the Mueller report, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the latest allegations, deriving from a July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian leader, were a \u201cpretty dramatic event.\u201d \u201cThis is about not the last election, this is about the election next year,\u201d added Hoyer. \u201cThis is about the future. This is about protecting America\u2019s election and America\u2019s national security.\u201d The House Intelligence Committee is in negotiations to interview the whistleblower who wrote an extraordinary complaint that detailed the nature of the phone call with Ukraine. Senior White House officials then endeavored to conceal records of the call including the official transcript, according to the complaint. On the phone call, Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner had been investigated by Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Shokin. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d said Trump on the call, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d Trump also said he wanted his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Bill Barr to call Zelensky. On August 12, a whistleblower expressed concerns to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general Michael Atkinson about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Atkinson deemed them credible and urgent and sent the complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The complaint was released ahead of Maguire\u2019s testimony Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee told CNN on Friday that they hope to talk to the whistleblower in the next two weeks while other members of Congress go home for recess. Some said they\u2019d like to also hear from Barr and Giuliani, and even the unnamed senior White House staffers who the whistleblower alleged tried to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the Trump-Zelensky phone call, including the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House. On Friday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued subpoenas to the State Department for documents in consultation with the Intelligence and Oversight panels, seeking information related to the department\u2019s role as Giulani met with Zelensky advisers. Pelosi has said she had no specific timeline in mind for the probe, but suggested that investigation may not last long, suggesting it could conclude before the judicial branch resolve the fights between the legislative and executive. If the House voted to impeach the President, two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate would then decide whether to remove him from office. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to drag on,\u201d Pelosi said Friday on MSNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re in court on many of these cases whether it\u2019s the President\u2019s taxes, his bank accounts, his accounting emoluments, postal of other things. I think this probably would be done before the courts.\u201d \u201cBut looking at the, shall we say, the material that the administration is giving us, they are actually speeding up the process,\u201d added Pelosi. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN he hopes the \u201cpublic pressure will be too great\u201d for the White House to deny requests for documents and witness interviews. He cited the decision by the administration to ultimately provide the whistleblower complaint and accompanying documents to Congress and allow Maguire to testify. \u201cI think in this particular matter some of the issues are too hot for them to handle if they just stonewall,\u201d Krisnhamoorthi said. \u201cThat being said if they do, which they probably will, we may have to exercise other remedies.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A whistleblower has alleged that President Donald Trump solicited a foreign country to help intervene in the 2020 election and that the White House sought to cover it up. Trump has attacked the whistleblower and called those who provided the individual with information \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d But the person who made the complaint is part of a storied American tradition of concerned individuals who felt they had a duty to bring potential wrongdoing to light. Here\u2019s what to know about the whistleblowing process. Intelligence community watchdog feared Trump's Ukraine call was 'national security' risk A whistleblower is an employee who discloses information that they reasonably believe is \u201cevidence of illegality, gross waste or fraud, mismanagement, abuse of power, general wrongdoing, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\u201d according to the Government Accountability Project, a non-profit group that advocates for whistleblowers. Whistleblowers can be an employee of a corporation, a non-profit organization or governments, but for the purposes of this story, we\u2019ll focus on the whistleblowing process for federal government employees. For legal purposes, the government defines whistleblowing as a process through which a person files a complaint through secure, designated channels \u2014 typically inspectors general or congressional oversight committees. It depends. For someone who works for a civil service agency, like the Food and Drug Administration or the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are several ways that a whistleblower can disclose information. Whistleblowers can take a complaint to an authority in their agency. Some agencies, like the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trade Commission, have established whistleblowing programs through which employees can submit tips and even receive awards for doing so. Whistleblowers can take complaints to the inspector general, congressional members or their staff, and in some cases, the media. For employees of the 17 intelligence agencies, collectively known as the intelligence community, the options are limited \u2014 both because the information they\u2019re dealing with could be classified or because the president might want to withhold certain information from lawmakers. Those employees can take a complaint to someone in their chain of command, or they can go to the inspector general of their agency or of the intelligence community. To take a complaint directly to Congress, they would need to seek permission from their agency. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 requires that, if the inspector general determines that the complaint is credible and of urgent concern, then the director of national intelligence \u201cshall, within 7 calendar days \u2026 forward such transmittal to the intelligence committees.\u201d If the inspector general doesn\u2019t find the complaint credible or of urgent concern, then the whistleblower can take it to Congress. But to be protected, a whistleblower would have to follow orders from the director of national intelligence on transmitting that information in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise national security. No. The anonymous whistleblower who made the complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president did follow proper procedures, as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire repeated in his testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Acting spy chief tells Congress the 'whistleblower did the right thing' But the complaint was not released to Congress in that time frame. Maguire said that was because the complaint involved the President \u2014 and executive privilege kept him from releasing it earlier. Laws like the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act protect federal government employees who report violations of the law and other abuses, preventing federal agencies from retaliating against employees who report that information. But those laws don\u2019t apply to a lot of employees who work in national security or intelligence. Congress did pass the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act in 1998, which created a process for whistleblowers in the intelligence community to take complaints or information to Congress. In 2010, Congress established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, giving whistleblowers another avenue through which to report information. And in 2012, President Barack Obama issued a directive to protect intelligence whistleblowers from retaliation, like getting fired or losing security clearance, but the order still left some gaps. Whistleblowers come forward out of a sense of duty, David Colapinto, co-founder and general counsel of the National Whistleblower Center, told CNN. \u201cIt takes a lot for somebody like this whistleblower, who has presumably worked in the intelligence community for some time, to decide to take the risk of what might happen to his or her career to report concerns of this magnitude,\u201d Colapinto said.",

            "article_content": "America\u2019s top spy broke with Donald Trump and his Republican supporters Thursday, defending a whistleblower and intelligence committee watchdog who exposed contacts with Ukraine that could help lead to the President\u2019s impeachment. \u201cI believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law,\u201d said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, testifying before a key House committee. But Maguire declined to say whether he spoke to the President about the whistleblower complaint that alleged that Trump solicited the help of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and that White House officials tried to hide his conduct, in the latest twist of a fast-escalating drama that has turned into the most serious crisis of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI am not partisan and I am not political,\u201d said Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander who served eight presidents in uniform and was not a well-known public figure until he was thrust into the glare of the scandal. NYT: Trump says whistleblower 'close to a spy,' suggests punishment Democrats used the high profile forum to accuse the President of abusing his power and endangering national security. Republicans tried to pick holes in the complaint, noting that the unidentified whistleblower admitted not having first-hand knowledge of events including Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Under intense pressure from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Maguire also acknowledged that his office consulted with the White House counsel\u2019s office after receiving a complaint detailing allegations about Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine, because calls with foreign leaders usually fall under executive privilege. Maguire had been accused before the hearing of caving into White House pressure not to follow the law and turn over a complaint that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general deemed \u201curgent and credible.\u201d The acting DNI repeatedly defended his handling of the complaint, telling lawmakers he followed the law in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d situation, despite claims to the contrary by Democrats that he infringed on their right to review the allegations. His appearance before the committee and a closed door briefing before the Senate panel, came a day after lawmakers had their first chance to see the classified account that spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The account was declassified and released Thursday morning. The complaint states that several White House officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky and tried to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House. Maguire said during his testimony he did not have the authority to waive the executive privilege that covered the conversation with Ukraine\u2019s President and would not say whether he discussed the complaint with Trump. \u201cMy conversations with the President, because I\u2019m the director of national intelligence, are privileged, and it would be inappropriate for me, because it would destroy my relationship with the President in intelligence matters, to divulge any of my conversations with the President of the United States,\u201d Maguire said responding to a question from Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat. Justice Department ignored additional allegations when considering if complaint could be shared with Congress But in a tense exchange with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Maguire conceded that \u201cthere is an allegation of a coverup.\u201d \u201cBut right now, all we have is an allegation \u2014 an allegation with second hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge on whether or not that is true and accurate statement,\u201d he said. When asked later in the hearing if Trump asked him to disclose the identity of the whistleblower, Maguire told lawmakers,\u201d I can tell you emphatically, no.\u201d He also said no one else within the White House or DOJ asked him to identify the whistleblower. Initially, Maguire seemed to waver about the chronology of events related to his handling of the complaint but ultimately told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that his office did seek guidance from the White House before raising the issue with the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice, which advised he was not legally bound to provide it to the committee. \u201cSuch calls are typically subject to executive privilege, as a result we consulted with the White House counsel\u2019s office and were advised that much of the information of the complaint was in fact subject to executive privilege,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cA privilege that I do not have the authority to waive. Because of that we were unable to immediately share the details of the complaint with this committee.\u201d The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided a redacted version to Congress that members can bring to an open hearing, a spokesperson said. The anticipation ahead of Maguire\u2019s testimony was also amplified by the White House\u2019s decision to release a transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the leader of Ukraine that shows the President repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Washington Post: Acting spy chief threatened to resign if White House restricted his testimony The conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is included in the whistleblower complaint, a source familiar with the situation said last week, a revelation that only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry, a move that has raised the stakes of this week\u2019s events. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, started the hearing by accusing Trump of betraying his oath of office and compromising US national security for Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal, political benefit,\u201d referring to the conduct outlined in the call transcript released Wednesday. \u201cIt forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office: impeachment. Now this matter would not have come to the attention of our committee or the nation\u2019s attention without the courage of a single person- the whistleblower,\u201d he said. Republicans, however, keyed in to the fact that the whistleblower acknowledged they did not have firsthand knowledge of most of the events described in the complaint. \u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described,\u201d the whistleblower wrote, noting that they were aware of details in the complaint pertaining to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian President because of \u201cWhite House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d But the public now has a way to test the accuracy of at least part of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint by comparing the details related to that call to the transcript released by the White House Wednesday. By all appearances, the information is consistent. In his testimony Thursday, Maguire continued to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint, saying he was told by the Department of Justice it did \u201cnot meet the statutory requirement of \u2018urgent concern,\u2019\u201d required to transmit to Congress and insisted that decision was \u201cbinding.\u201d \u201cAfter reviewing the complaint, and the inspector general\u2019s transmittal letter, the office of legal counsel determined that the complaint\u2019s allegations do not meet the statutory requirement definition (of) legal, urgent concern, and found that I was not legally required to transmit the material to our oversight committee,\u201d he added. Last week, Maguire refused to comply with a deadline to hand over a whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee that had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be \u201ccredible and urgent,\u201d a conclusion that drove his push to provide Congress with the details and refer the matter to the Justice Department for consideration of criminality. Maguire suggested during his testimony that he understood the importance of the complaint itself. \u201cI realized \u2026 full and well the importance of the allegation,\u201d Maguire said, adding later, \u201cwhen I saw that, I anticipated having to sit in front of some committee some time to discuss it.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump could have been exposed to \u201cserious national security and counterintelligence risks\u201d if he pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, in a call this summer, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general said. The explosive charge is among the reasoning cited in Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee Michael Atkinson\u2019s report which said the complaint by a whistleblower, which detailed the July 25 call and other moves by the Trump administration regarding Ukraine, amounts to an \u201curgent concern\u201d and \u201cappears credible\u201d \u2013 two statutory requirements considered as whistleblower allegations progress through review. READ: Inspector General letter on whistleblower complaint \u201cIn the ICIG\u2019s judgment, alleged conduct by a senior US public official to seek foreign assistance to interfere in or influence a Federal election\u2026 would also potentially expose such a US public official (or others acting in concert with the US public official) to serious national security and counterintelligence risks with respect to foreign intelligence services aware of such alleged conduct,\u201d Atkinson wrote. Despite the inspector general\u2019s transmitting of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire along with his finding of \u201curgent concern\u201d in late August, the complaint was not sent to Congress until this week. In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday, Maguire said that he consulted with the White House counsel\u2019s office and later the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel after receiving the complaint for guidance on how to handle it. In its guidance, which Maguire has said was \u201cbinding,\u201d the Justice Department disputed Atkinson\u2019s determination that the complaint constituted an \u201curgent concern,\u201d therefore releasing the DNI from an obligation to send it to Congress. On Thursday, Maguire defended his decisions, calling the situation \u201cunprecedented.\u201d He said that \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d concerns regarding the President\u2019s phone call also prevented his release of the complaint to Congress. \u201cIt was not stonewalling,\u201d Maguire told lawmakers. \u201cI have to comply with the way the law is, not the way some people would like it to be. And if I could have done otherwise, it would have been much more convenient for me.\u201d Atkinson\u2019s letter substantiating the whistleblower\u2019s \u201curgent concern\u201d and credibility, dated August 26, was released by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Thursday morning. In his argument, Atkinson also cites Trump\u2019s own words from a recent executive order about the \u201cextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\u201d posed by foreign interference in US elections. Atkinson said he also established the whistleblower\u2019s credibility, revealing new details about his or her connection to the information in the allegations, while also acknowledging the whistleblower\u2019s potential political bias. Though much of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is based on information attributed to unnamed US officials as well as news reports, Atkinson wrote in his analysis that the whistleblower has \u201cofficial and authorized access to the information and sources referenced\u201d in the complaint. The whistleblower also has \u201csubject matter expertise related to much of the material information\u201d in the complaint, Atkinson wrote. Atkinson is aware of the whistleblower\u2019s identity, he wrote. In its two-week preliminary review of the allegations, the ICIG office \u201cidentified some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d though Atkinson adds that that evidence \u201cdid not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern \u2018appears credible\u2019, particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As President Donald Trump tries to elude oversight in Congress for his actions, including recent dealings with Ukraine, Trump\u2019s personal lawyers have made a far-reaching claim that could remove a judicial check on a president\u2019s alleged transgressions. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued in a federal case to be heard Wednesday that the Constitution shields the president from any criminal investigation \u2013 not just from actual prosecution \u2013 while he holds office. Among their legal justifications, Trump lawyers quote a 2009 law review essay written by now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that declared: \u201cEven the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation \u2013 including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators \u2013 are time-consuming and distracting. \u2026 [C]riminal investigations take the President\u2019s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\u201d In the 1990s, Kavanaugh was on independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s team that spurred the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. But Kavanaugh, who Trump nominated to the bench last year, said that after he worked for President George W. Bush, he saw the need to protect the presidency from the criminal process. It is difficult to predict how Kavanaugh and fellow conservative justices who constitute the majority on the US Supreme Court would rule on Trump\u2019s assertion of complete immunity from the criminal process. But accepting it would defy court precedent and basic constitutional principles. \u201cThe government was founded in resistance to a king who claimed absolute power. The Constitution was framed so that no one person, even the president, is above the law,\u201d said University of Georgia constitutional law professor Diane Marie Amann. With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement Tuesday of a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump appears to face the greatest threat right now from the US House of Representatives. But history has demonstrated that litigation against a president can be of significant consequences. It was a court decision requiring President Richard Nixon to turn over Oval Office tapes incriminating him in the Watergate scandal that ultimately ended his presidency. The Trump case to be heard Wednesday in New York arises from the President\u2019s effort to block a state grand jury subpoena for records from his accounting firm Mazars USA. The New York District Attorney is investigating hush-money payments made to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump before he was president. The re-emergence of Kavanaugh controversy could hurt Democrats' Senate chances in 2020 A separate case, arising from a House subpoena against Mazars is pending in a federal appeals court in Washington, DC. The Department of Justice is largely siding with Trump\u2019s personal lawyers in that lawsuit, and last month filed a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief arguing that the House may not authorize a subpoena unless it can cite a specific legislative purpose. Amann and other legal scholars say they doubt Trump\u2019s attempt to elude all subpoenas would succeed at the high court. These are unpredictable, unsettled times in national politics, as well as within the federal judiciary. Chief Justice John Roberts has a record of high regard for executive branch prerogatives. He is among the majority of current justices who served in the executive branch early in their career. Yet the chief justice has also made plain his larger concern to keep the judiciary out of the volatile politicization that has seized the country and taken steps to separate himself from Trump. As Trump has continually defied the Democratic-led US House of Representatives, he has simultaneously sought greater influence in the Third Branch, including through \u201cus versus them\u201d tweets differentiating between his judicial appointees and those of Democratic presidents. In the case to be heard Wednesday in the southern district of New York, Trump is trying to staunch part of the judicial process. He is suing the New York County District Attorney\u2019s office to kill a grand jury subpoena for tax returns and other financial documents from Mazars. District Attorney Cy Vance is investigating so-called hush money paid to women who alleged affairs with Trump. Vance is pursuing whether the Trump Organization violated New York state law regarding reimbursement for the payoffs to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Asking a federal judge to prevent the New York subpoena, Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote, \u201cThe U.S. Constitution \u2026 prohibits the District Attorney from criminally investigating, prosecuting, or indicting the President while he is in office.\u201d They point to the President\u2019s core powers under Article II of the Constitution and the Supremacy Clause. They contend history is on their side: \u201cThe Framers of our Constitution understood that state and local prosecutors would be tempted to criminally investigate the President to advance their own careers and to advance their political agendas. And they likewise understood that having to defend against these actions would distract the President from his constitutional duties.\u201d In a response filed Monday, Vance\u2019s team contended that \u201cno such sweeping immunity\u201d exists for a sitting president. It noted that the subpoena was directed at the Mazars and should not interfere with the President\u2019s executive responsibilities. List: The 174 House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump Prosecutors also referred to multiple state and federal investigations that have already centered on the President, including special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into election interference and obstruction of justice. Mueller, in fact, found that a sitting President could not be criminally charged, based on decades-old Department of Justice rules, but a President could be investigated. Trump\u2019s team has deemed the Vance effort a political exercise more than anything, calling the subpoena \u201ca bad faith effort to harass the President by obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law.\u201d The US House lawsuit was heard in July by a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a ruling is expected any day. Trump is appealing a decision by US District Court Judge Amit Mehta in May rejecting Trump\u2019s arguments. \u201cIt is simply not fathomable,\u201d Mehta wrote, \u201cthat a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct \u2013 past or present \u2013 even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.\u201d Unlike disputes over Trump administration policy that began immediately in January 2017 when the new President imposed a travel ban \u2013 and have found the Supreme Court largely deferring to Trump \u2013 cases testing his personal business dealings have not yet reached the nine justices. The DC Circuit dispute over the House subpoena for Mazars USA and a separate New York-based Second Circuit case arising from the House\u2019s effort to obtain financial records from Deutsche Bank for Trump, his children and Trump-family controlled entities are the farthest along. In a separate series of complaints, the 2nd Circuit earlier this month revived an ethics lawsuit against Trump that contends his hotel and other business interests violate the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which prevents the President from accepting gifts from foreign governments without the permission of Congress. The 4th Circuit, conversely, has rejected an Emoluments-related lawsuit brought by the District of Columbia and Maryland against Trump in his personal capacity for possible conflicts of interest. The DC Circuit will take up a third case on the issue, testing whether Democratic members of Congress can pursue their lawsuit against Trump for failing to allow Congress to review and vote on his business interests Trump has refused to follow the usual presidential practice of divesting personal business interests once in office, and he has so far successfully prevented any collection of evidence in the lawsuits regarding the constitutionality of his business holdings. In the tax-records case to be heard Wednesday by US District Court Judge Victor Marrero, Trump\u2019s lawyers acknowledge that no prior cases directly bolster the Trump position, and they minimize the reach of cases that subjected Presidents Nixon and Clinton to investigation. Read: Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump In the 1974 Nixon case arising from a subpoena for Oval Office tapes related to the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an assertion of executive privilege. The justices said the need for evidence in a pending criminal trial overrode the President\u2019s assertion that he had a constitutional right to keep communications private. After being forced to turn over the incriminating tape recordings, Nixon resigned. More than two decades later, in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who said Clinton had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. The next year, in 1998, Starr obtained a subpoena to compel Clinton\u2019s testimony in a separate matter involving Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern with whom Clinton had had an affair. When Clinton agreed to the interview, Starr withdrew the subpoena. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 he keeps almost self-impeaching. The storm over Trump\u2019s self-admitted call for Ukraine\u2019s President to investigate his potential 2020 election foe Joe Biden may turn out to be his most perilous political scandal. But it is also threatening to obliterate the House speaker\u2019s fragile political perch atop her caucus, a majority of which rejects her reluctance to open impeachment proceedings. Pelosi, trading on her reputation as the master of her troops, has argued that the best way to deal with Trump is to oust him at the next election. She fears that a backlash from impeachment could electrify Trump\u2019s base and doom Democrats who helped her win back the House last fall. And since Republicans will almost certainly never help to produce the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump in a Senate trial, the argument is that Democrats are walking into an impeachment trap. The speaker has been trying to build a case to 2020 voters that Trump is guilty of obstruction and is unfit for office \u2013 but has always stopped short of pulling the impeachment trigger. \u201cThe President is almost self-impeaching because he is every day demonstrating more obstruction and disrespect for Congress\u2019 legitimate role to subpoena,\u201d Pelosi said in May. But the latest twists over Ukraine suggest that the politics of impeachment may be changing inside the House Democratic caucus and that the President\u2019s accusations that Biden is guilty of corruption \u2013 for which there is no evidence \u2013 may be consuming her maneuvering room. List: The 145 House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump Pelosi is also facing increasing criticism among commentators who believe her strategy enables ever bolder power grabs by the President. And 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are becoming ever more vocal in calling for impeachment. Seven freshman Democrats who are also veterans of the military and defense and intelligence agencies penned an op-ed in The Washington Post warning that if Trump had threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine in order to force it to help him in the election it would be an impeachable offense. Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of military and security aid to Ukraine at least a week before the call in question, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. \u201cThese new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government,\u201d they wrote. Pelosi is showing signs she\u2019s feeling the tide turn. In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower\u2019s complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain. \u201cWe will have no choice,\u201d Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. During the flight, Pelosi read the op-ed from seven freshman Democrats and said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the President\u2019s actions \u201crepresent an impeachable offense.\u201d \u201cIt will be a big week,\u201d Pelosi said. And Trump\u2019s brazen behavior suggests he is far from cowed by the current Democratic oversight offensive, which he stymied with executive privilege claims and court challenges. Last week\u2019s Capitol Hill appearance by his former campaign manager Cory Lewandowski, who put on a show of obstruction and outrage that delighted his boss, threatened to turn the whole process into a farce. Trump\u2019s approach to Kiev \u2013 which he basically admitted on Sunday \u2013 suggests he will stop at nothing to win reelection. Some Democrats already think the 2016 election was stolen. If they come to believe the 2020 vote could be compromised, Pelosi will come under extreme pressure to do something with the power that she won in the 2018 midterm election. And she may come to consider history\u2019s judgment of her strategy. There is also a chance that if the controversy keeps escalating, Senate Democrats could warm to the idea of jamming Republicans in 2020 with the toughest vote of their careers \u2013 to convict or acquit an unpopular President.

If at some point, the Ukraine controversy convinces leading Democrats that the political liabilities of not moving against Trump outweigh the liabilities of doing so, the dam could break. The same could be the case if Democrats come to believe that they can damage Trump more by voting on articles of impeachment than letting him off the hook. Pelosi\u2019s warning over the weekend that if the administration did not hand over to Congress a whistleblower\u2019s complaint on the Ukraine affair Democrats would have to move to a \u201cwhole new stage of investigation\u201d appears to hint at this new reality. She didn\u2019t use the word impeachment, but her words were left hanging hours after her ally, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN impeachment could be the only remedy. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reported on Monday that Democrats, including freshmen moderates from districts Trump won, are privately telling colleagues they could embrace impeachment if the storm intensifies. The tipping point would be if there\u2019s evidence that Trump sought to withhold the aid to Ukraine in exchange for Kiev opening a probe into the Bidens, sources said. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on Monday that it was clear that Trump had crossed a line. \u201cI mean, extorting a foreign leader for the purposes of getting that leader to do your political work, to try to find dirt on your opponent is extortion,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s an impeachable offense.\u201d But Himes also explained the nuanced politics that have undergirded Pelosi\u2019s political thinking so far and her desire to follow public opinion \u2013 not the impulses of her most radical members on the question of impeachment. He pointed out that the next election will come down to a few states and that Democrats should not doing anything that compromises their chances. \u201cIt is not fear of Donald Trump. It is fear of a second Trump term,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I happen to believe that an impeachment inquiry would actually probably, at worst, be neutral in those states. But that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here.\u201d How the drama will unfold in the coming days is difficult to predict, because it remains unclear exactly what Trump said to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. But in a possible sign that his remarks could contain material that could be portrayed as incriminating, Trump went on a tear at the UN General Assembly on Monday. It was classic Trump, as he sought to whip up a narrative that will stir his political base and offer fodder for the conservative media. He gave no quarter, showed no sense of personal vulnerability and, in another familiar play, accused someone else of a charge to which the President himself has often seemed vulnerable. \u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt.\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair right now.\u201d There is no evidence that Biden or his son Hunter did anything corrupt in Ukraine. Authorities in Kiev have said that Biden\u2019s son did not break the law by joining the board and taking money of a prominent energy firm. How Trump's Ukraine call completely changed the impeachment equation The President also said on Monday that he did not threaten to withhold military aid that Ukraine needs to stand up to Russia to force Zelensky to investigate Biden. It\u2019s possible that a transcript of his conversations with the Ukrainian President could leave Trump sufficient wiggle room for his explanations to be seen as credible and for the scandal to join the churning mix of previous controversies that have tarnished his presidency but never felled him. But the fact that the administration is trying to prevent the whistleblower\u2019s report on the affair from being handed to Congress is fueling suspicion about his behavior. And in theory at least, there might not need to have been a specific quid pro quo for Trump to be judged to have abused the power of his office and the public trust. Any pressure on a vulnerable foreign leader to target a domestic opponent would represent severe overreach by the President, a fact one Trump adviser recognized by saying, \u201cThis is a serious problem for us\u201d adding \u201che\u2019s admitted doing it.\u201d Still, there is an almost endless list of incidents, comments and transgressions that many Washington observers thought represented the last straw for Trump. And he\u2019s ridden out them all. So in the end, Pelosi may have to decide whether public opinion would sustain an impeachment drive against Trump \u2013 or whether it could end up hurting Democrats. In other words, she\u2019d face a new dimension of the same dilemma she\u2019s faced all along. No one can say yet if her answer would be different. This story has been updated to reflect additional reporting on the nearly $400 million in military and security aid to Ukraine that was held.

            "article_content": "A smoldering Washington intelligence mystery exploded late Wednesday into a full-on confrontation between House Democrats and the White House over communications between President Donald Trump and an unidentified foreign leader. A showdown over a whistleblower\u2019s \u201ccredible and urgent\u201d complaint was revealed \u2013 first by The Washington Post and later confirmed by CNN \u2013  to concern the President himself, raising new questions about the motivation of the acting director of national intelligence\u2019s refusal to reveal details of the case to Congress. The revelations have unleashed a new firestorm in the nation\u2019s capital over Trump\u2019s perplexing foreign policy dealings and the administration\u2019s across-the-board efforts to frustrate Congress\u2019 constitutionally authorized role of oversight of the executive branch. But they will also open debate about the extent of the President\u2019s powers, which give him expansive latitude in national security. The whistleblower\u2019s claims are also certain to bolster the belief among Trump and his supporters that nefarious forces are operating within America\u2019s intelligence establishment to undermine him \u2013 a refrain conservatives have used in the wake of the Russian election interference operation. And they will likely further damage the President\u2019s trust in America\u2019s spy agencies. The Post reported that an official in the American intelligence community was so bothered by a \u201cpromise\u201d Trump had made while communicating with a foreign leader that the official filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, according to two former US officials familiar with the matter. CNN has not confirmed the detail about the \u201cpromise.\u201d It is unclear to whom Trump was speaking at the time. The President dismissed the reporting on Thursday morning, rhetorically asking if there is \u201canybody dumb enough to believe\u201d it. \u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d Trump said. The complaint was filed on August 12. White House records show Trump had spoken to or interacted with five foreign leaders in the previous five weeks, the Post reported: Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar. Trump\u2019s private, in-person meetings with Putin and Kim especially have intrigued observers. The Post\u2019s report, and CNN\u2019s subsequent confirmation, shed light on an intrigue that puzzled Washington for the last few days. The drama centers on the refusal of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to hand over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress. The stalling had already prompted speculation that Trump or senior aides could be involved. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday in a closed hearing that he was not allowed to provide details of the complaint, sources told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Under the law, the substance of a whistleblowers\u2019 claims cannot be provided until the report is sent to Congress. Democrats argue that the DNI is breaking the law by refusing to pass on the complaint, an accusation Maguire\u2019s office denies. After a standoff with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Maguire agreed Wednesday to testify next week, in a public hearing about the affair. There is no indication that he will hand over the report \u2013 especially in an open hearing. Schiff had sent rumors into overdrive on Sunday when he said Maguire had cited a \u201chigher authority\u201d in refusing to hand over the complaint and referred to \u201cprivileged communications.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to assume this involves either the President or people around him or both,\u201d the California Democrat said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The reports will trigger a controversy about Trump\u2019s handling of intelligence and his opaque conversations with foreign leaders. A political duel will also rage about the whistleblower\u2019s decision to make the complaint. On one hand, the President\u2019s sweeping powers in foreign policy conferred by the Constitution and a democratic mandate give him wide latitude to say whatever he likes to a foreign leader. American presidents have been making promises to their counterparts on the world stage for generations. It\u2019s a practice that might be said to be part of their job. Yet the exception would be if a president were engaging in contact antithetical to the interests of United States or carrying out illegal or unconstitutional acts that contravened his oath of office. There is no indication that is the case in the current controversy. Former FBI and CIA official Phil Mudd, who is now a CNN analyst, on Wednesday argued that it was unfair to expect a senior intelligence official to reveal sensitive information about a president\u2019s conversations to Congress and it was not the job of America\u2019s spies to monitor him. \u201cCan you explain to me a) why it is the US intelligence community\u2019s responsibility to listen to the President of the United States speaking to a foreign leader and b) why it is the US intelligence community, under the rules provided by the Democrats in Congress, (who) are responsible to report to the Congress what the President of the United States says?\u201d Mudd asked. \u201cWhen I served, we were responsible for chasing the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and terrorists,\u201d Mudd said on \u201cCuomo Prime Time.\u201d \u201cWe are not responsible for reporting to the Congress what the President says. He can say what he wants.\u201d Viewed another way, Maguire\u2019s conduct appears to be the latest manifestation of the administration\u2019s multi-front strategy to thwart Congress\u2019 oversight efforts. If an inspector general in a government department finds misconduct or uncovers information that rises to a high level of wrongdoing defined as \u201curgent and credible\u201d under whistleblowing legislation, the legal recourse is to involve Congress. The controversy came to a head only a day after Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski put on an aggressive display in a House Judiciary Committee hearing that prompted the White House to preview a sweeping executive privilege claim even though he never worked for the federal government. The White House has sought to prevent testimony from many other current and former executive branch officials, leading to a string of looming court clashes that in themselves fulfill Trump\u2019s goal of slowing Democratic investigations. Maguire is a retired Navy admiral who formerly led the National Counterterrorism Center. He was chosen by Trump following a succession drama after the permanent director \u2013 former Sen. Dan Coats, who was never seen as close to the President \u2013 announced he would step down in July. Trump passed over the office\u2019s No. 2, Sue Gordon. Sources told CNN at the time she was not seen as the kind of loyalist Trump wanted in the role. At the time, Maguire was seen as a force for stability. Trump\u2019s first pick to replace Coats, Rep. John Ratcliffe, stepped down after controversy over the Texas Republican\u2019s qualifications and amid concern he would be a political appointee who would first be loyal to the President, not his duty as director of national intelligence. Schiff announced Wednesday that Maguire will appear before the House Intelligence Committee at 9 a.m. on September 26. His comment over the weekend that Maguire was citing privilege considerations raises the prospect that the committee could see a replay of a now-familiar scenario. Witnesses are increasingly showing up at hearings \u2013 like Lewandowski \u2013 armed with letters from the White House lawyers advising them to limit their testimony to issues not likely to be involved in expansive future executive privilege claims. Schiff said Monday that he does not know the exact nature of the complaint, as he has not yet received the details from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The California Democrat also doesn\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower. The acting director\u2019s letter Tuesday to Schiff, obtained by CNN, states that the complaint does not involve anyone in the intelligence community but rather \u201cstakeholders within the Executive Branch.\u201d As a result, its lawyer argues, the complaint is not of \u201curgent concern\u201d to the office. The Senate Intelligence Committee is also getting involved in the case. The panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, told reporters that he and his Republican counterpart \u201cwant to get answers. We need to protect whistleblowers and we hope to get some resolution next week.\u201d Its chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, earlier declined to comment, but, while saying he would follow the whistleblower\u2019s progress, added, \u201cThat\u2019s not typically something that Congress gets involved in.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen, Manu Raju, Ted Barrett and Ellie Kaufman contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t think he will be held in contempt of Congress a day after the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman threatened to do so following a contentious hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to be held in contempt and I\u2019ve told the members of Congress I\u2019m happy to come back and answer more questions if they need me to, after the five- or six-hour charade I went through yesterday,\u201d Lewandowski, a former CNN political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota on \u201cNew Day.\u201d The testy back-and-forth between Lewandowski and Camerota continues the former campaign official\u2019s steadfast stonewalling of both Democratic investigators as well as media scrutiny of Trump\u2019s White House and campaign. On Tuesday, Lewandowski sat for a roughly six-hour House Judiciary Committee hearing in which he largely ignored questions from the panel\u2019s Democrats on whether Trump obstructed justice. The hearing, which was the first official impeachment-related hearing on Capitol Hill in the wake of the Russia investigation, was largely filled with barbs, partisan attacks and references to Lewindowski\u2019s possible New Hampshire US Senate campaign. The hearing grew so heated that the panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler of New York, threatened to hold Lewandowski in contempt, saying later that the White House\u2019s effort to restrict Lewandowski\u2019s testimony was based on \u201ccrony privilege.\u201d Lewandowski stonewalls and frustrates Democrats in contentious Capitol Hill hearing At one point in Wednesday\u2019s CNN interview, Lewandowski questioned what he would be held in contempt for, arguing that he answered a considerable amount of the questions posed to him by the panel\u2019s members. The former campaign official did occasionally disclose new details about his role in an incident that former special counsel Robert Mueller examined for potential obstruction. He confirmed that Trump told him to order then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the Mueller investigation so that it would only look for future election meddling \u2013 and stop probing his 2016 campaign. Lewandowski, who appeared before the committee under subpoena, expressed frustration on Wednesday about the order, saying to Camerota that he\u2019s \u201cnow testified in front of Congress on four separate occasions (and) spoke to the special counsel\u2019s office on two separate occasions.\u201d \u201cThey could have just asked me to come, and I would have been happy to do so. They chose to subpoena me and change the rules last week \u2026 and I was still there,\u201d he said. Lewandowski: 'I have no obligation to be honest with the media' At the hearing, Lewandowski revealed that he hadn\u2019t read Mueller\u2019s nearly 450-page report, an admission he reiterated to Camerota on Wednesday during a testy exchange about the report\u2019s content. \u201cBy the way, the Mueller report was very clear: there was no collusion, there was no obstruction,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the Mueller report said, Corey,\u201d Camerota replied. \u201cIt absolutely says that. You should read the page that states that on,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cDid you read the Mueller report?\u201d Camerota asked, to which the former campaign official replied: \u201cNo, I never did.\u201d During his CNN interview, Lewandowski also addressed an exchange he had during the hearing with Barry Berke, a lawyer for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, in which he said he has \u201cno obligation\u201d to tell the truth to the media. \u201cI\u2019m as honest as I can be, as often as I can be,\u201d Lewandowski told Camerota.

Gregory Cheadle, of California, told \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d he believes the Republican Party is pursuing a \u201cpro-white\u201d agenda and using black people like him as \u201cpolitical pawns.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0just sick and tired of the way\u00a0blacks and other people of color\u00a0have been treated by this\u00a0administration and by the GOP,\u201d Cheadle told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Thursday on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d He said he has been frustrated with Trump\u2019s rhetoric on race and the lack of diversity in his administration and judicial appointments. Cheadle told Burnett he wouldn\u2019t use the term \u201cracist\u201d to describe the President, but said Trump has a \u201cwhite superiority complex.\u201d Trump singled out Cheadle at a rally in 2016 in an attempt to tout his support among African Americans. Exit polls of the 2016 election found that Trump received 8% of votes cast by African Americans, with 89% of them choosing Democrat Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls in the subsequent two-and-a-half years have found that he remains highly unpopular among African Americans. Moreover, a July Quinnipiac University poll showed a majority (51%) of voters believed that Trump is a racist. Forty-five percent said that he is not. Cooper examines Trump's history of racist comments Cheadle told Burnett he is now more critical of the 2016 moment when Trump said, \u201cLook at my African American over here,\u201d at a California rally. At the time, Cheadle told CNN he was not offended by Trump\u2019s comment. Now, he said he questions Trump\u2019s intent.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski antagonized Democrats and stonewalled their questions about obstruction of justice during the first official impeachment-related hearing on Capitol Hill in the wake of the Russia investigation. The roughly six-hour House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday was so contentious, and yielded so little information, that the panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, threatened to hold Lewandowski in contempt. Lewandowski appeared under subpoena but refused to answer dozens of key questions. Democrats hoped the televised hearing would refocus public attention on former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, which revealed evidence that Trump obstructed justice during his first year in office, Instead, the hearing rapidly deteriorated into partisan bickering as participants hurled insults in almost every direction and tangled over parliamentary procedure. But between the barbs, partisan attacks and references to Lewindowski\u2019s possible New Hampshire US Senate campaign, the former Trump staffer occasionally disclosed new details about his role in an incident that Mueller examined for potential obstruction. He confirmed that Trump told him to order then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the Mueller investigation so that it would only look for future election meddling \u2013 and stop probing his 2016 campaign. \u201cJeff and I are friends socially, and I wanted to have the opportunity to have a meal with Jeff and relay the conversation\u201d about limiting the Mueller probe, Lewandowski said about his attempts to convey Trump\u2019s message privately to Sessions, away from his Justice Department office. The Mueller report said Lewandowski didn\u2019t meet Sessions and didn\u2019t carry out Trump\u2019s orders. But prosecutors analyzed Trump\u2019s involvement and concluded there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that his actions met the legal threshold for obstruction of justice. Mueller declined to decide whether Trump should face charges, and sitting presidents are shielded from prosecution. Recent efforts by House Democrats to push forward with their own investigation of Trump\u2019s potential obstruction have largely been stymied by White House claims of executive privilege, uncooperative witnesses who still support Trump and lawsuits that are bogged down in court. Corey Lewandowski is trolling to please Donald Trump Tuesday\u2019s hearing offered little progress on any of those fronts and was bitterly divided from the start. Nadler, a New York Democrat, accused the White House of orchestrating \u201can absolute cover-up\u201d by blocking some witnesses from appearing at the public session and trying to restrict Lewandowski\u2019s testimony based on \u201ccrony privilege.\u201d \u201cMr. Lewandowski, your behavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable and it is part of a pattern by a White House desperate for the American people not to hear the truth,\u201d Nadler said, adding that contempt proceedings against him were \u201ccertainly under consideration.\u201d After the hearing, Nadler told CNN that the hearing adds more weight for impeachment, harkening back to efforts to impeach Richard Nixon (Nixon resigned before he was impeached). \u201cArticle 3 of Nixon\u2019s impeachment was obstruction of Congress, refusing to obey defined congressional subpoenas, pleading imaginary privilege,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cAnd obviously that\u2019s what the President has been doing. Nixon wasn\u2019t foolish to say in advance that he\u2019s going to defy all congressional subpoenas \u2026 and today we saw a witness instructed by the White House completely contemptuous of Congress who refused to answer relevant questions. Just another instance of obstruction of Congress and that\u2019s what Article 3 of the Nixon impeachment was.\u201d Lewandowski used his opening statement to attack Democratic members of the committee, criticize Obama-era intelligence officials for not doing enough to stop Russian meddling, and stoke conspiracies about \u201cTrump haters\u201d in the government that wanted to bring down Trump. He even took a jab at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about her email controversy. Trump, who watched parts of the hearing aboard Air Force One, cheered on his former aide in a tweet, saying, \u201cSuch a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\u201d Mueller investigated 10 episodes involving Trump for potential obstruction of justice, and the incident with Lewandowski was one of those episodes. In the report, prosecutors analyzed whether each incident checked the three boxes needed to typically bring an obstruction charge. Some of the incidents did not meet the threshold, and others were a close call. Prosecutors determined Trump\u2019s actions with Lewandowski checked all three boxes for obstruction: It was a distinct \u201cobstructive act\u201d that would hamper the investigation, the action was directly linked to an ongoing criminal probe, and there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of Trump\u2019s obstructive intent. Lewandowski said under oath Tuesday that Mueller\u2019s report was \u201can accurate representation\u201d of his conversations with Trump in summer 2017, when Trump wanted Sessions to stop Mueller from investigating the campaign and retool the probe to focus on meddling in future elections. He also confirmed that Trump dictated to him the statement that Sessions was supposed to make to the public, clearing Trump of collusion and accusing Mueller of breaking the law. But when it came time for Lewandowski to deliver that message to Sessions, he instead went on vacation, telling lawmakers, \u201cI took my kids to the beach \u2026 that was more of a priority.\u201d \u201cThe President never asked me to do anything illegal,\u201d Lewandowski said. READ: Judiciary Chairman Nadler's opening statement at Lewandowski hearing By and large, Lewandowski refused to answer questions from Democrats. The White House had sent a letter on Monday to the committee saying that it was directing Lewandowski not to answer questions about his conversations with Trump, beyond what is in the Mueller report. Lewandowski vehemently denied colluding with Russia, even though he was never formally accused of collusion. He criticized his onetime internal rival, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for sharing internal polling data with a Russian associate. And he admitted that he never called the FBI after learning that a campaign adviser was in contact with Russians. The dramatic partisan split was on full display throughout the marathon hearing. Democrats, who control the committee, traded insults with Lewandowski. One lawmaker said Lewandowski \u201cchickened out\u201d because he didn\u2019t follow Trump\u2019s questionable orders. Lewandowski calls Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's questioning 'just a rant' During a brief recess, Lewandowski\u2019s posted a link on Twitter to a new website that is promoting his potential Senate campaign next year in New Hampshire. One senior Democrat on the panel later called out Lewandowski for seemingly using the hearing to appeal to the GOP base. \u201cLet me remind you, Mr. Lewandowski, that this is not a Republican primary campaign,\u201d said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is the chairman of the Democratic caucus. \u201cYou are not on the campaign trail yet. This is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\u201d On the other side, Republicans hailed Lewandowski\u2019s prowess as the campaign manager for Trump\u2019s long-shot presidential bid. They tried to paint him as a sympathetic figure who has already given many hours of testimony to Mueller and a slate of congressional committees. Republicans have spent their time mostly attacking Democrats, calling them the \u201cParty of Impeachment,\u201d in Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe\u2019s words, and asking for hearings on other issues. Rep. Jim Jordan, the firebrand Republican from Ohio, said lawmakers should investigate alleged abuses by the Justice Department and should not focus on impeachment. A growing number of Democrats publicly support impeachment, though not enough to pass a resolution. \u201cI think they hate this President more than they love their country,\u201d Lewandowski said of the Democrats, a comment that later drew consternation from Democratic members of the panel. The committee also subpoenaed former White House aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter to appear Tuesday to testify about their role in the Lewandowski incident, and other matters that were mentioned in the Mueller report. They did not show up, and the White House previously claimed that both men are immune from testifying before Congress due to executive privilege. The committee has objected to this rationale previously and is currently suing to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify after the White House made a similar claim when he was subpoenaed earlier this year. Similar proceedings could follow for Dearborn and Porter. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Jeremy Herb and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee is holding its first impeachment investigation hearing on Tuesday, September 17. Here is the opening statement of Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-New York: \u201cToday\u2019s hearing is entitled \u2018Presidential Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Power.\u2019 This hearing is the first one formally designated under the Committee\u2019s procedures adopted last week in connection with our investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Trump. \u201cWe subpoenaed three witnesses to this hearing: Rick Dearborn, Rob Porter, and Corey Lewandowski.  Unfortunately, we learned last night that the White House is blocking the first two from even showing up, and tightly limiting the third. The White House has no authority, legal or otherwise, to give these orders. \u201cWe had wanted these three individuals to testify before the Committee and the American people because they are critical witnesses to the incidents of obstruction laid out in the Mueller Report. \u201cIn at least five of those episodes, evidence laid out in the Special Counsel report established that all the elements of obstruction of justice were met.  Today\u2013despite the roadblocks the White House has thrown up\u2013we will focus on one of the most concerning of those five episodes.  It is the President ordering the Attorney General, through Mr. Lewandowski, to stop the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation into the president and his campaign.  As the Report detailed, Mr. Dearborn was enlisted as a part of that effort as well. Mr. Porter has other critical evidence regarding obstruction. \u201cAs our hearings with the Special Counsel and other outside experts established, anyone else involved in these episodes of obstruction would have been charged with a crime.  Anyone else.  Let that sink in. \u201cThe President knows this, and the White House is intent on preventing the American people from hearing the details.  So it\u2019s no surprise the White House blocked two of our witnesses, Mr. Porter and Mr. Dearborn, from showing up at all today. \u201cOn behalf of the President, the White House and Department of Justice are advancing the same spurious legal doctrine as they did when this Committee called on the most important obstruction witness to testify:  former White House Counsel, Don McGahn. \u201cThey claim Porter and Dearborn, like McGahn, are absolutely immune from testifying before Congress.  There is no such thing. The only court ever to consider this purported absolute immunity doctrine totally rejected it.  That is why we have gone to court in the McGahn case to set it aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening today is more troubling than McGahn\u2019s failure to appear.  Because even if we apply DOJ\u2019s own made-up rules of absolute immunity, I question how Mr. Dearborn fits under those rules. \u201cAccording to DOJ opinions, \u2018absolute immunity\u2019 applies to quote \u2018the President\u2019s immediate advisers \u2026 who serve as the President\u2019s alter ego\u2026.\u2019  To extend this already dubious doctrine to someone like Dearborn who is far more removed from the President than McGahn is a dangerous new stretch.  I think we should call this what it is \u2014an absolute cover up by the White House. \u201cMr. Lewandowski is here and has vital information about presidential obstruction.  But the White House wants to limit our and your ability to hear it all. \u201cMr. Lewandowski was called alone, one-on-one, into the Oval Office on June 19, 2017 and again on July 19, 2017.  And the President did something I find startling.  He dictated a speech to Mr. Lewandowski   A speech not for Mr. Lewandowski but for Attorney General Sessions to deliver. \u201cHe secretly told Mr. Lewandowski to put the following words in the AG\u2019s mouth I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections. (Vol. II, 91) \u201cAs the Mueller Report found, limiting the investigation to future elections would have cut off the investigation of any past conduct and struck at the heart of the Special Counsel\u2019s mandate.  It would have ended the investigation of the President.  The evidence found by the Special Counsel met all the elements of obstruction. \u201cMr. Lewandowski was nervous about this demand from his former boss\u2014as he should have been.  It raised serious questions about criminal conduct.   On top of that, the AG was recused\u2014forbidden from doing anything regarding the Mueller investigation.  He was certainly not allowed to curtail it. \u201cSo Mr. Lewandowski tried to surreptitiously meet with the AG.  When that failed, he tried to pass the buck to Mr. Dearborn.  Mr. Lewandowski gave Mr. Dearborn the script that had been dictated by the President.  All while telling the President that he would follow through on the President\u2019s orders. So that\u2019s what we want to try to learn more about today.  As we learned with Special Counsel Mueller, witness testimony is critical to any investigation. \u201cBut the White House doesn\u2019t want us or the American people to hear this story in full. Late yesterday, the White House sent us a letter claiming that Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s conversations with the President \u2018are protected from disclosure by\u2026Executive Branch confidentiality interests.\u2019   They say he may testify about Presidential communications that are already disclosed in the Report, but no more. \u201cThey make that claim despite the fact that he was a private political operative, apparently was not offering advice of any kind\u2014the usual prerequisite for executive privilege\u2014and was enlisted for apparent wrongdoing. \u201cNo court has ever said that the President is entitled to confidentiality under these circumstances.  Indeed, the Department of Justice has said executive privilege should not be invoked to conceal evidence of wrongdoing on the part of executive officers. \u201cThe White House is advancing a new and dangerous theory: the crony privilege.  It makes absolute immunity look good by comparison.  Where are the limits? \u201cThis is a coverup plain and simple.  If it were to prevail\u2014especially while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment\u2014it would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders. \u201cAnd today\u2019s coverup is a part of a pattern of the White House blocking Congress.  The President has announced his desire to \u2018fight all the subpoenas.\u2019  The White House\u2019s obstruction of Congress ranges across nearly every committee and virtually every investigation of the Administration\u2014whether related to children in cages, botched security clearances, or their failure to defend the country from ongoing attacks by a foreign adversary. \u201cWell, Mr. Lewandowski you are here under subpoena, and that means you are required to answer our questions.  All our questions, completely and truthfully. \u201cOur investigation also extends beyond the four corners of the Mueller Report.  We are looking at corruption and abuse of power more broadly, so we will inquire about other subjects as well. \u201cWe will not be daunted by the coverup.  We intend to secure accountability for any wrongdoing.  Because no one is above the law\u2014not even the President of the United States.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The White House is asserting that two former senior White House aides have immunity from testifying and is directing former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski not to answer questions about events that occurred after President Donald Trump was elected. The White House sent letters to the House Judiciary Committee on Monday about the testimony of Lewandowski and former aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter, who were all subpoenaed to appear on Tuesday. The White House asserted immunity for the former White House aides not to testify and instructed Lewandowski not to answer questions about his conversations with the President where the White House could invoke executive privilege, beyond what\u2019s already in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. \u201cMr. Lewandowski\u2019s conversations with the President and with senior advisers to the President are protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting Executive Branch confidentiality interests,\u201d wrote White House counsel Pat Cipollone, \u201cand, as a result, the White House has directed Mr. Lewandowski not to provide information about such communications beyond the information provided in the portions of the Report that have already been disclosed to the Committee.\u201d The House Judiciary Committee last month subpoenaed Lewandowski, Dearborn and Porter, but the two White House aides are not expected to appear, sources said, citing the White House arguments, while Lewandowski is unlikely to engage on the episodes detailed in the special counsel\u2019s obstruction of justice report where he was involved. Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have rejected the Trump administration\u2019s legal arguments of immunity and the right to claim executive privilege. In a statement Monday night, House Judiciary Committe Chairman Jerry Nadler said the decision to keep the aides from testifying was \u201ca shocking and dangerous\u201d use of executive privilege. \u201cThe President would have us believe that he can willfully engage in criminal activity and prevent witnesses from testifying before Congress \u2013 even if they did not actually work for him or his administration,\u201d the New York Democrat said. \u201cIf he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment, he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders.\u201d The White House\u2019s position on the testimony of Lewandowski, Porter and Dearborn adds to the growing fight between the Trump administration and the Judiciary Committee over the panel\u2019s investigation and its efforts to obtain testimony from those cited by Mueller. The White House has also asserted immunity over the testimony of former White House counsel Don McGahn, and the committee has sued in order to compel his appearance, which is still being litigated. \u201cThe Department of Justice has advised me that Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Porter are absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to their services as senior adviser to the President,\u201d Cipollone wrote in a separate letter. Porter\u2019s attorney Brant Bishop told the committee on Monday that the executive and legislative branches were at odds over the issue, and Porter would respect his former employer\u2019s wishes. \u201cThe Committee\u2019s dispute is with the White House, not with Mr. Porter,\u201d Bishop wrote. The outcome of the McGahn case will likely determine whether Dearborn and Porter ultimately testify before the committee, too. Other witnesses have appeared before congressional committees but declined to answer questions about the Trump White House or the presidential transition. Hope Hicks, for instance, would not discuss anything about her time in the White House, including where her office was located, though she did answer questions about her time on the campaign. As Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, Lewandowski won\u2019t have privilege to decline to answer questions about the campaign. But the committee is most interested in questioning him about Mueller\u2019s detailing of alleged episodes that occurred in the White House, which he is unlikely answer, including when the President allegedly instructed him to tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the Mueller investigation, and Lewandowski did not follow through. The White House is not asserting executive privilege but claiming the right to do so in the future. Lewandowski testified before the House Intelligence Committee last year behind closed doors in a contentious, profanity-laced session, and he did not answer questions about anything that occurred beyond the 2016 election. The White House has made similar claims about the right to assert executive privilege for someone who didn\u2019t work in the White House, including when former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach testified before the House Oversight Committee, when the White House said Kobach\u2019s conversations with the President about adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census were \u201cconfidential.\u201d",

            "article_content": "White House officials have been engaged in preliminary discussions about invoking executive privilege to limit former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski from complying with a congressional subpoena, despite Lewandowski never serving in any role in the administration, according to three sources. House Democrats authorized a subpoena for Lewandowski last month, and served it Thursday. The White House has invoked executive privilege in the past to block former aides such as Don McGahn from complying with similar congressional subpoenas. While testifying in June, Hope Hicks declined to answer nearly every question about her time in the West Wing, citing instructions from President Donald Trump that she was \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from answering. Annie Donaldson, McGahn\u2019s deputy, also did not answer more than 200 questions in her written responses to the House Judiciary Committee, citing similar immunity. But this would be the first time Trump has tried to invoke privilege for someone who has never worked in the administration when it comes to the Russia investigation. McGahn, Hicks and Donaldson all held titles in the West Wing; Lewandowski has only informally advised Trump since his work on the 2016 campaign ended. The White House once asserted that former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach\u2019s conversations with the President about adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census were \u201cconfidential.\u201d Kobach nonetheless testified in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. House panel subpoenas Lewandowksi and former White House official as impeachment push ramps up Trump officials and allies aren\u2019t confident the move on Lewandowski will work, skeptical that the President will be able to assert the same executive privilege principles over an informal adviser as he would a staff member. The White House has been in contact with members of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department about whether it would be successful, and say it remains an option. A White House official cautioned that the discussions are preliminary and no formal Office of Legal Counsel opinion has been sought or rendered by the White House counsel\u2019s office yet, though there is one related to Kobach\u2019s testimony. \u201cExecutive privilege exists to protect internal government information that, if made public, would cause some damage to the country,\u201d said Mark Rozell, the author of \u201cExecutive Privilege: Presidential Power, Secrecy and Accountability.\u201d \u201cIt applies to the President and high-level executive branch officers, not private citizens who never served in the administration.\u201d \u201cLewandowski\u2019s role with Trump officially was in the context of a political campaign, months prior to the President taking office. As executive privilege is an implied Article II based presidential power, it does not apply to campaign activities or to the deliberations between a successful candidate and campaign staff,\u201d said Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \u201cIn short, this is a colossal overreach of the President\u2019s authority to claim executive privilege. There is no basis for it in this case,\u201d he added. House Democrats authorized the subpoena for Lewandowski and others in July. As administration officials have discussed invoking privilege to stop him from answering certain questions related to his conversations with the President, they were waiting for the subpoena before taking any official action. White House officials do not believe Lewandowski will be able to cite immunity to avoid answering questions, because it is reserved for government employees, but maintained there is a possibility they could invoke privilege over some of his answers. The conversations about executive privilege reveal the boundaries the White House is willing to test to prevent the President\u2019s allies \u2013 even those who have never held a formal role in the administration \u2013 from answering questions about sensitive topics in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In his report, Robert Mueller detailed how Trump asked Lewandowski to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to rein in the special counsel\u2019s investigation so it would focus only on election interference. Though Lewandowski arranged a meeting with Sessions, the report says Sessions canceled because of a \u201clast minute conflict.\u201d Lewandowski then contacted Rick Dearborn, an administration aide who worked for Sessions when he was a senator, asking him to deliver the message instead. Democrats approved one dozen new subpoenas for witnesses listed in Mueller\u2019s report, including several who have worked in the administration \u2013 Sessions, Jared Kushner, John Kelly \u2013 in addition to others who have not, such as Lewandowski and David Pecker, the American Media executive who helped buy the silence of women who alleged they had affairs with the President.",

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday issued subpoenas to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and a former White House official as it ramps up its investigation to determine whether to impeach President Donald Trump. The committee issued the subpoenas Thursday to Lewandowski and former White House aide Rick Dearborn, requesting they testify publicly before the committee on September 17. Both Trump aides were cited extensively in the obstruction of justice section of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. The subpoenas don\u2019t come as a surprise \u2014 the duo was included when the committee authorized subpoenas to 12 individuals last month \u2014 but they signal the direction the committee is taking as it looks to quickly gather evidence that could lead to pursuing impeachment. WH officials look at executive privilege for Lewandowski who never worked at the White House The House has not voted on a formal impeachment inquiry, but House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler says his committee\u2019s investigation constitutes \u201cformal impeachment proceedings\u201d and the committee has a goal of deciding whether to recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year. \u201cIt is clear that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence Special Counsel Mueller uncovered in his report,\u201d Nadler said in a statement. \u201cCorey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn were prominently featured in the Special Counsel\u2019s description of President Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the Special Counsel, and then by ordering him to lie about it.\u201d Peter Chavkin, Lewandowski\u2019s attorney, questioned why Lewandowski was receiving a subpoena from the committee. \u201cMr. Lewandowski has voluntarily appeared before and cooperated with Congress three times answering questions for hours. He also has spoken for hours with the Special Counsel\u2019s office. In light of this, it is fair to ask what could be gained from requiring him to appear yet again,\u201d Chavkin said, declining further comment. A Republican Judiciary Committee aide also criticized the subpoena, accusing Democrats of wasting \u201cmore time and taxpayer dollars as Democrats demand information we already have.\u201d So far, the committee\u2019s subpoenas have not yielded much of value beyond dozens of objections to questions about anything that happened in the Trump administration and a pair of lawsuits to try to obtain former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury information and testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. The subpoena to Lewandowski comes as he is considering a Senate bid in New Hampshire. He\u2019s attending the President\u2019s rally Thursday night in the state, and White House aides say to expect Trump to bring up Lewandowski\u2019s potential Senate run. By subpoenaing Lewandowski, the committee hopes it can avoid the executive privilege fight with the White House, which has directed McGahn, former White House communications director Hope Hicks and former deputy White House counsel Annie Donaldson not to answer questions beyond the 2016 election. Unlike those officials, Lewandowski never served in the Trump administration. List: The 122 House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump But it\u2019s unclear if Lewandowski will be forthcoming about the key episodes referenced in the Mueller report that will want to press him on, such as when the President instructed him to tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the Mueller investigation and Lewandowski did not act on it. White House officials have been engaged in preliminary discussions about invoking executive privilege to limit Lewandowski from complying with the subpoena, according to three sources. Lewandowski testified before the House Intelligence Committee last year behind closed doors, and he did not answer questions about anything that occurred beyond the 2016 election. The committee last week filed a lawsuit to force McGahn to comply with its subpoena after he did not appear under subpoena for a hearing in May. The outcome of that case is likely to determine whether other former Trump officials can refuse to answer questions about the Trump White House. But it\u2019s likely to take months, if not longer, before the case is decided. The Judiciary Committee has pointed to two episodes involving Lewandowski from the Mueller report as clear cases of obstruction of justice. The first was when Trump told Lewandowski to ask Sessions to limit the Mueller investigation not to investigate the Trump campaign but to \u201cmove forward with investigating election meddling for future elections.\u201d Lewandowski tried to set up an in person meeting with Sessions, but did not do so, according to the special counsel. That led to the second episode the committee cited, which also involved Dearborn. A month after making the request to Lewandowski about Sessions, the President followed up with Lewandowski and told him that if Sessions did not meet with him, he would be fired. Lewandowski did not deliver the intended message to Sessions. Instead, he asked Dearborn to speak to Sessions, believing he would be a better messenger, the special counsel wrote. Lewandowski gave Dearborn a typewritten version of the President\u2019s message, which \u201cdefinitely raised an eyebrow\u201d for Dearborn and made him uncomfortable, according to Mueller\u2019s team. Dearborn told Mueller he did not recall if he knew the message was from the President. Dearborn later told Lewandowski he had handled the situation but he did not follow through. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Jeremy Diamond and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump all-but endorsed a potential Senate run by his former campaign manager ahead of a campaign rally in New Hampshire where Corey Lewandowski is expected to join Trump on stage. Lewandowski has been huddling with New Hampshire political operatives and confidants in recent weeks \u2013 joined in some meetings by his wife \u2013 as he mulls a potential Senate bid in the Granite State, multiple sources familiar with the discussions said. He now appears to have his former boss\u2019s blessing, a voice that could help sway Republican primary voters. Lewandowski never joined the White House, but has remained an influential voice in Trump\u2019s ear, serving in his kitchen cabinet of informal outside advisers. How Corey Lewandowski overplayed his hand \u201cI think he would be fantastic,\u201d Trump said of his former campaign manager in a radio interview on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s made that decision yet. I will say this \u2013 if he ran, he would be a great senator. If he ran and won, he\u2019d be a great senator. He would be great for New Hampshire. He would be great for the country.\u201d But a Lewandowski candidacy would also exhume a slew of controversies. Lewandowski was charged with battery after he grabbed a female reporter who was attempting to question Trump after a news conference during the 2016 campaign, though the charges were later dropped. One New Hampshire Republican operative also noted that Lewandowski would be forced to reveal the sources of his income over the course of the Trump presidency, a disclosure he has closely guarded while serving as an adviser to various clients and alongside lobbyists even though he did not register as a lobbyist. Lewandowski to Democrats: I'm not answering your 'f---ing' questions Lewandowski also features prominently in the investigatory report by special counsel Robert Mueller, which reveals that Trump sought to curtail the Mueller investigation by directing Lewandowski to deliver a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions, Trump told Lewandowski, was to declare the investigation \u201cvery unfair\u201d to the President and to announce that he would meet with Mueller and \u201clet (him) move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections.\u201d Lewandowski never delivered the message. The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena on Thursday demanding Lewandowski appear publicly before the committee. The subpoena did not come as a surprise as Lewandowski was one of 12 officials the committee authorized subpoenas for last month. The committee is interested in speaking to Lewandowski about episodes related to obstruction of justice from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, including the incident involving Sessions. It\u2019s not clear whether Lewandowski would comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena or answer questions about that episode but the White House is already exploring the possibility of invoking executive privilege even though Lewandowski never served in the administration. Other former White House officials have refused to discuss matters that occurred during the Trump administration under direction from the White House, and Lewandowski did not answer questions about anything beyond the 2016 election when he testified last year before the House Intelligence Committee. Lewandowski is scheduled to meet Trump at the airport ahead of the rally on Thursday and White House and campaign aides said they expected Trump to invite Lewandowski on stage during the rally. Lewandowski is also expected to be joined at the rally by his wife and children, a rarity that is fueling rumors that Lewandowski is on the precipice of announcing a Senate bid. In recent days, Lewandowski also met with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials in Washington, a source familiar with the matter said. But the possibility of a Senate run by the hard-charging, sharp-elbowed political operative has provoked a backlash from some Republican officials and strategists who worry that Lewandowski \u2013 who cashed in on his connection to Trump through a lucrative and opaque consulting business over the last two years \u2013 would struggle to defeat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and could drag down Trump\u2019s chances of capturing the state\u2019s four electoral votes. \u201cCorey Lewandowski is a shadow lobbyist with a nefarious client list that includes foreign interests, which is why New Hampshire Republicans and even Gov. Chris Sununu have been keeping their distance,\u201d said Josh Marcus-Black, a New Hampshire Democratic Party spokesman. Lewandowski allies, meanwhile, insist a bid by the longtime Trump adviser would help drive up enthusiasm among Trump\u2019s core voters in the state and make Trump more invested in winning the state, which Trump lost by fewer than 3,000 votes in 2016, one Lewandowski ally said.

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee is now engaged in a full-blown investigation and legal fight with the goal of deciding whether to recommend articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump by the end of the year, according to Democratic officials involved in the effort. Recent court filings and public statements by top Democrats point to a dramatic escalation after lawmakers debated internally for months over mounting an impeachment inquiry into the President. As additional House Democrats continue to call for the House Judiciary Committee to launch an impeachment inquiry \u2014 which more than half the caucus now supports \u2014 Democratic sources say the issue is essentially moot since what the panel is doing is basically that: investigating whether Trump should be impeached. The more aggressive posture could help House Democrats convince the courts to side with them in their legal battles with the Trump administration. But it still remains to be seen whether it ultimately leads to the House taking the historic step of making Trump just the third president to be impeached. List: The 120 House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler backs an impeachment inquiry and has made clear in a series of steps and public statements that he is actively considering recommending articles of impeachment in an attempt to remove Trump from office, something the House made clear in a new lawsuit to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify. \u201cThis is formal impeachment proceedings,\u201d Nader told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Thursday on \u201cOutFront.\u201d In the fall, the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a set of hearings with key witnesses whose testimony would be part of the committee\u2019s impeachment deliberations, according to multiple sources. And after months of resisting formal impeachment proceedings, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s tone over impeachment has shifted in recent days, endorsing the House Judiciary Committee moves and making clear to her caucus that the panel is considering whether to use its constitutional power to try and remove Trump from office. What\u2019s less clear, is whether Pelosi is simply blessing the moves in an attempt to bolster the House\u2019s court cases or if she\u2019s seeking to set the stage for impeaching Trump. Publicly, she\u2019s not ruling out impeachment. Nadler, for his part, is making increasingly clear where he stands. \u201cHe has said it many times over the past few weeks now,\u201d one source familiar with Nadler\u2019s thinking said when asked if he supports an impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s as clear as day.\u201d Previously, however, Nadler privately pushed Pelosi to support opening a formal impeachment inquiry, making the argument that doing so would improve the House\u2019s chances in court. Up until this past month, Nadler had mostly avoided answering questions about whether he backed an impeachment inquiry. \u201cAs I said, we are launching an inquiry now, and whether we\u2019ll launch an impeachment inquiry, it may come to that,\u201d Nadler said in a June interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, drawing a distinction between his committee\u2019s investigation and an impeachment inquiry. Yet at a July hearing, Nadler telegraphed where his committee was going ahead of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony, saying, \u201cArticles of impeachment are under consideration as part of the committee\u2019s investigation, although no final determination has been made.\u201d Nadler\u2019s rhetoric shifted more decisively at the end of last month when his committee petitioned a federal court to provide the House with secret grand jury material from Mueller\u2019s investigation. The committee\u2019s lawsuit said explicitly that it was conducting its investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment, and Nadler said it was \u201cin effect\u201d an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThere is one difference which you could draw,\u201d Nadler said at a news conference in late July. \u201cIf you said that an impeachment inquiry is when you\u2019re considering only impeachment, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. We are investigating all of this and we are going to see what remedies we could recommend, including the possibility of articles of impeachment. We\u2019re not limited to that, but that\u2019s very much the possibility as a result of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d The committee\u2019s lawsuit filed Wednesday to obtain testimony from McGahn, who has ignored the committee\u2019s subpoena at Trump\u2019s direction, was clearer about the aims of the panel\u2019s probe, calling him the \u201cmost important witness\u201d besides the President himself. \u201cThe Judiciary Committee is conducting an investigation to understand the scope and extent of misconduct by President Trump, and that investigation includes consideration of whether the Judiciary Committee should exercise its Article I powers to recommend articles of impeachment,\u201d the lawsuit said. The complaint continued: \u201cTo fulfill its duties, the Judiciary Committee must obtain testimony and evidence from witnesses to the President\u2019s actions to determine whether to recommend such articles against the President, or whether to recommend additional or alternative articles that the Judiciary Committee may prepare.\u201d Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, has repeatedly accused Democrats of trying to have it both ways by appearing like they are conducting impeachment proceedings when they are not actually doing so. The committee\u2019s argument that it\u2019s effectively conducting an impeachment inquiry already comes after months of House Democrats slowly growing in numbers backing the formal opening of an impeachment inquiry. Their ranks grew from several dozen in the days after Mueller\u2019s May public statement where he emphasized the investigation did not exonerate the President to more than half of the caucus this month. But the committee is now arguing that the Democrats\u2019 calls for an impeachment inquiry are unnecessary. In court, the Trump administration has argued that the House\u2019s subpoenas to date lack a legislative purpose. By asserting the investigation is directly tied to impeachment, the committee has a reason under the constitution to pursue the documents and testimony it\u2019s seeking. Democrats argue that the forthcoming committee hearings will be clearly linked to their impeachment deliberations. In July, the committee voted to authorize subpoenas for 12 individuals, including the President\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But the committee is considering bringing in officials on their list who did not serve in the White House \u2014 which Democrats hope will prevent claims of executive privilege from the White House, although the White House would likely seek to block any discussion about events that took place after the 2016 election. The committee is expected to issue some those subpoenas in the coming weeks to seek testimony in September and October, potentially to Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager; David Pecker, the chairman of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc.; and Dylan Howard, a lawyer for the women alleging affairs with Trump who received hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign. Pelosi has shifted her tone over impeachment in recent weeks \u2013 and aides say she\u2019s green-lit the language in the House lawsuits that contend the committee is considering voting on whether to impeach the President. She has long contended the House needs to be methodical in its approach, but has consistently batted away talk that the chamber\u2019s goal was to impeach Trump, arguing such a move would be divisive and ultimately unsuccessfully since two-thirds of the GOP-led Senate would need to vote to remove Trump from office. Pelosi\u2019s recent posture is different than in March, when she argued that \u201cI don\u2019t think we should go down that path\u201d of impeachment, later saying that doing so may not be worth it because it will \u201cend at the Senate\u2019s edge.\u201d In May, Pelosi claimed the House is \u201cnot on a path\u201d to impeachment, arguing to CNN in June that there\u2019s \u201cnothing as divisive to the country, in my view, as impeachment.\u201d Since the Mueller testimony, however, she has instead said the focus is on their court battles first, keeping the door more open than she had previously in suggesting the House could impeach Trump. And asked by CNN after the Mueller hearing if she\u2019s still concerned that the GOP-led Senate would acquit the President, making impeachment fruitless, she claimed she was \u201cnever\u201d concerned about what the Senate would do. \u201cIf we have a case for impeachment that\u2019s the place we will have to go,\u201d Pelosi said after the Mueller hearing. \u201cBut the stronger our case is the worse the Senate will look for just letting the President off the hook.\u201d Recent statements also spotlight Pelosi\u2019s difference in tone. In a letter to her caucus this week, she noted the language in the House Judiciary lawsuit, calling it a \u201csignificant step\u201d and quoting directly from the suit to say that the House must have all the facts to consider whether to use its constitutional power of \u201cutmost gravity \u2013 approval of articles of impeachment.\u201d Pelosi added: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d Some Democrats argue that Pelosi may be changing her tune to help their legal case and may ultimately resist moving forward. But it\u2019s unclear how she\u2019ll come down. \u201cI think she feels the need to keep the investigative momentum going,\u201d said one Democratic lawmaker who is close to Pelosi. \u201cBut she\u2019s not going to impeachment until she thinks the public is ready.\u201d CNN\u2019s Caroline Kelly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former White House communications director Hope Hicks is not responding to any questions about her time at the White House in a closed-door congressional interview Wednesday, angering Democrats who say they expect to go to court to force her to answer their questions. White House attorneys are objecting to all questions related to the White House, Democrats say, all the way down to where Hicks sat in the West Wing. But Hicks is answering questions about her time on the Trump campaign, which is not covered by executive privilege. RELATED: She stopped returning some of Trump\u2019s calls. Now Hope Hicks is testifying behind closed doors In questioning about the campaign, Hicks told lawmakers that she did not have knowledge during the 2016 campaign of the hush-money payments made in the run-up to the election, according to three sources with knowledge of her testimony. Hicks has so far not answered questions about whether she was informed of the payments while working at the White House because the White House argued that fell under her time covered by their claim of immunity from congressional testimony, the sources said. Hicks was asked by Democrats about her comments in a Wall Street Journal story about the payments to Playboy playmate Karen McDougal published before the election, in which she called the payments \u201ctotally untrue.\u201d The White House is not asserting executive privilege, but arguing that Hicks has absolute immunity from testifying as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump. Democrats called that legal claim \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d as they signaled they will likely challenge it in court. \u201cThere is no such thing as absolute immunity that prevents someone from answering questions about any subject related to their work in an administration. It just doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. \u201cThis is an ongoing effort by the president of the United States to obstruct, to prevent Congress from finding the facts and behaving as if he\u2019s above the law.\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told reporters as he exited the interview, which is still ongoing, that she was answering some questions. \u201cHope Hicks answered some questions. She gave us a lot of good information. The White House asserted so-called absolute immunity, which is ridiculous and which we\u2019ll destroy in court,\u201d Nadler said. Although many questions from Democrats were not answered, Hicks did provide some responses, such as when she was asked about her House Intelligence Committee testimony from 2018 in which she said that she sometimes told white lies on behalf of the President. Under Democratic questioning, Hicks told the panel that she never lied about anything \u201csubstantial,\u201d according to multiple sources. Hicks said that the lies were about small matters such as scheduling, which was similar to her previous testimony. Still, it\u2019s not clear how fruitful the interview was, as multiple Democrats said they learned little from the testimony. \u201cNothing new,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat. \u201cNot too much,\u201d responded Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California when asked what she learned. Hicks\u2019 appearance is the first time a member of Trump\u2019s inner circle is appearing before a Democratic committee investigating the President, which comes as Nadler\u2019s committee wrestles with whether to begin an impeachment inquiry. Trump weighed in on Hicks\u2019 interview on Twitter Wednesday, accusing Democrats of \u201cextreme presidential harassment.\u201d \u201cThe Dems are very unhappy with the Mueller Report, so after almost 3 years, they want a Redo, or Do Over. This is extreme Presidential Harassment,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey gave Crooked Hillary\u2019s people complete Immunity, yet now they bring back Hope Hicks.\u201d He followed up with another tweet Wednesday afternoon, accusing Democrats of \u201d putting wonderful Hope Hicks through hell.\u201d Republicans criticized Democrats for trying to interview Hicks in the first place. Rep. Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican, called the interview a \u201ctotal waste of time\u201d as he left the room. And Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the committee, called Hicks\u2019 appearance merely an attempt from Democrats to generate a \u201cpress release.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re hearing a dramatic reading of the Mueller report, but nothing new,\u201d Collins said when asked if he had learned anything. The White House\u2019s objections to Democrats\u2019 questions were expected, as White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent the House panel a letter Tuesday evening arguing that Hicks was immune from testifying about her time at the White House as one of the President\u2019s senior advisers, citing executive privilege protections. \u201cBecause of this constitutional immunity, and in order to protect the prerogatives of the Office of President, the President has directed Ms. Hicks not to answer questions before the Committee relating to the time of her services as a senior adviser to the President,\u201d Cipollone wrote. Hope Hicks to testify behind closed doors before House Judiciary next Wednesday Asked Tuesday about the White House instructing Hicks not to answer questions, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \u201cObstruction of justice.\u201d Democrats\u2019 decision to focus on the hush-money payments in addition to obstruction of justice underscores that the committee is broadening the focus of its probe into the President \u2013 which Nadler has said the panel is undertaking before a decision is made on impeachment, to go beyond the episodes outlined in the Mueller report. Still, the committee is eager to speak to Hicks about her time at the White House. Committee aides said there were five episodes Mueller documented that they wanted to press Hicks about, including the firing of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Mueller probe and Trump\u2019s efforts to dismiss Mueller from overseeing the probe and to curtail the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The committee plans to release a transcript of Hicks\u2019 interview afterward, potentially within 48 hours. The Judiciary Committee wants to bring in witnesses to talk about the Mueller report publicly, but so far it has held only open hearings with experts. \u201cI hope eventually she and all witnesses will be in the public,\u201d said Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Pennsylvania Democrat on the committee. \u201cIt\u2019s our job. I really believe it\u2019s our job to get the facts before the American public. \u2026 The best, most effective way to do our oversight is to make sure it\u2019s in the public.\u201d Also looming: whether the committee will interview Mueller himself publicly \u2013 and if it will need a subpoena to do so. Nadler declined to comment on those negotiations Tuesday. Republicans argued that Hicks\u2019 interview is proof that Democrats\u2019 claims of White House stonewalling are overblown. Michael Flynn's new lawyer Sidney Powell fanned Mueller conspiracies \u201cJudiciary Democrats have been their own barrier to information by choosing to escalate instead of negotiate at every turn,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe White House has offered to negotiate with Democrats for documents that Ms. Hicks can\u2019t provide, and the committee could probably have heard from her earlier if Democrats didn\u2019t take a scorched-earth approach to pursuing information.\u201d Hicks has previously testified behind closed doors before the House and Senate Intelligence committees, and she left her job at the White House the day after appearing before the House panel. At those interviews, Hicks also did not discuss her time at the White House, Cipollone wrote. Democrats have argued that Hicks cannot claim executive privilege when she spoke to the special counsel\u2019s office about the same topics, but the Trump administration has countered that being interviewed in an executive branch investigation does not waive privilege for a legislative branch probe. That question is also one that\u2019s likely to end up in court for a number of witnesses the panel is seeking to interview. One potential point of contention is the presidential transition before Trump took office. Although Democrats \u2013 and some Republicans, like former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina \u2013 have argued that executive privilege does not apply to the transition, Cipollone argued in his letter Tuesday that Hicks\u2019 transition work would likely be privileged because it involved decisions that would be made after Trump was inaugurated.

            "article_content": "The White House is asserting immunity for President Donald Trump\u2019s long-time confidant Hope Hicks from testifying in the House Judiciary Committee about her time at the White House, setting up a showdown with Democrats when Hicks appears behind closed doors on Wednesday. But Democrats\u2019 on the House Judiciary Committee are also planning to press Hicks on events that occurred before Trump took office, including her knowledge of the hush-money scheme to silence Trump\u2019s extramarital affairs in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, according to a committee aide. The anticipated line of questioning signals renewed interest on Capitol Hill over the President being implicated in felonies committed by former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, after the panel has been mostly focused until now over the allegations detailed in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on obstruction of justice. Hicks is the first member of Trump\u2019s inner circle to appear before the House Judiciary Committee, which is undertaking its own investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power as House Democrats wrestle with whether to start an impeachment inquiry. But White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to the committee Tuesday ahead of Hick\u2019s appearance to argue that she is \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from being compelled to answer questions about her time as a senior adviser to the President. \u201cBecause of this constitutional immunity, and in order to protect the prerogatives of the Office of President, the President has directed Ms. Hicks not to answer questions before the Committee relating to the time of her services as a senior adviser to the President,\u201d Cipollone wrote, adding that Hicks previously testified before the House and Senate Intelligence committees under similar circumstances. The administration\u2019s position that she does not need to answer questions about her time in the administration is unlikely to satisfy the committee\u2019s Democrats, who could try to go to court to force her to answer their questions. At Wednesday\u2019s closed hearing, Hicks is expected to face questions from Democrats about at least five episodes detailed in the Mueller report that she had knowledge of or had witnessed first-hand, the aide said. In addition, Democrats plan to ask Hicks: Trump\u2019s conduct surrounding his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn; Trump\u2019s demands to ask the then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe; the President\u2019s actions surrounding the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey; Trump\u2019s efforts to dismiss Mueller from overseeing the probe; and allegations the President sought to curtail the Mueller probe. Moreover, they plan to press Hicks about her involvement in issuing misleading statements in 2017 after the Trump Tower meeting with Russians was revealed in press accounts. Plus, they have questions about then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is now in jail, according to the aide. While a White House official will be in the room during her testimony, Democrats say that they will not accept assertions of executive privilege over her entire time while serving as the White House communications director, arguing it won\u2019t hold up in court because she discussed these matters with the special counsel. If executive privilege is invoked, they will engage in an \u201con-the-spot\u201d negotiation over whether she can answer a particular question. The House Judiciary Committee is fighting a similar battle with former White House counsel Don McGahn, who did not appear under subpoena after the White House directed him not to answer questions about his time in the administration with a similar claim of immunity from congressional testimony. The House voted earlier this month to authorize the committee to go to court to enforce McGahn\u2019s subpoena. Democrats would not say yet if they would take Hicks to court if she declines to answer certain questions, but said the committee is not afraid to assert its authority to get their questions answered. It\u2019s not clear whether Hicks will also refuse to answer questions about the transition period between the election and Trump\u2019s inauguration. Cipollone argued in the letter that Hicks\u2019 responses \u201cwould likely implicate executive branch confidentiality interests concerning\u201d the President\u2019s decision-making once he took office. A transcript of the interview will be released \u2013 potentially within 48 hours \u2013 but Democrats plan to discuss what they learn at a Thursday public hearing about lessons learned from the Mueller report, the aide said.",

            "article_content": "In an extensive interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that aired Sunday evening. President Donald Trump made several factual blunders and repeated many of his favorite incorrect claims. Here\u2019s a look. In touting his policies to expand defense spending and strengthen the military, the President took credit for improving the Department of Veterans Affairs, specifically expanding health care choices for veterans. \u201cThe vets\u2013 the VA was in horrible shape,\u201d said Trump. \u201cNow, they have choice. And nobody could get choice. John McCain couldn\u2019t get it. Nobody could get it. They tried for years. They couldn\u2019t get it.\u201d Facts First: Trump is rewriting history. The Veterans Choice Program was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014 and was co-sponsored by Senator John McCain. Trump signed a bill to continue the program and eventually consolidated other programs under the new Veterans Community Care Program. Veterans Choice aimed to expand veteran\u2019s access to health care by increasing the number of medical staff in the VA system as well as allowing those who met certain criteria (either from wait time or distance to a VA facility) to see doctors outside of the VA system. The bill signed by Trump in June of 2018, the VA MISSION Act, will consolidate several different VA health programs into the new Veterans Community Care Program. The program was set to start this summer, and for the year between the VA MISSION Act provided $5.2 billion to continue the Veterans Choice Program. The bill also expanded veteran\u2019s ability to take their VA benefits to private doctors. When Stephanopoulos asserted that Americans are paying for the tariffs on China, Trump retorted \u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cChina subsidizes their product in order to keep people working,\u201d Trump said before going on to argue that many companies were also moving out of China in order to avoid the tariffs. \u201cSo there is no tariff.\u201d Facts First: Trump is flatly wrong on this notion. US consumers and companies pay a large chunk of the tariffs Trump has placed on China. In addition, while there is evidence that US importers are shifting part of their production outside China, there isn\u2019t much to suggest there\u2019s a mass exodus of companies relocating away from China. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that 40% of the cost of tariffs has been passed on to consumers, with producers and retailers taking on the rest. According to a study from economists at Princeton, Columbia and the New York Federal Reserve, by the end of 2018 US companies and consumers were paying $3 billion a month more, plus $1.4 billion in additional losses, because of these new tariffs, mostly on China. In their Economic Report published in March, Trump\u2019s own administration admitted that despite any \u201cbenefits\u201d which the tariffs may have are offset by the \u201ccosts paid by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced consumption.\u201d So yes, Americans are paying these tariffs. As for Trump\u2019s claim that companies are fleeing China to avoid paying tariffs, it\u2019s difficult to measure how prevalent that trend is. Or if it\u2019s even happening at all. US imports from countries outside of China have increased in the first four months of 2019 compared to last year: 22% from Taiwan, 17% from South Korea, 38% from Vietnam, and 13% from Bangladesh. But part of this increase could be part of an already upward trend of importing more from countries outside of China and from the strong US economy, which leads to higher imports overall. US Census Bureau trade data published this month noted that US importers are taking in 12% less from China this year. While this is a significant number it\u2019s difficult to argue that \u201cmany\u201d companies are moving out of China. Additionally, there are a large number of products made exclusively in China due to the interdependence of global supply chains. As Facts First has previously noted, for example, many raw materials integral to the US chemical industry now fall under Trump\u2019s tariffs and are \u201cunavailable outside of China,\u201d Jennifer Abril, president of the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates told CNN in May. Stephanopoulos pressed Trump on the most damning portions of the Mueller report, including the dozens of contacts between Trump\u2019s team and Russians. The report said numerous Trump associates were drawn into the Russian web and took meetings with Kremlin-tied figures who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton, but they did not cross the line into a criminal conspiracy. In his answer, Trump ignored these findings and attacked his 2016 opponent. \u201cWhat about Hillary Clinton?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cHillary Clinton conspired with Russia. She had somebody that came out of Russia. They got information from Russia. Excuse me. Hillary Clinton was totally involved with it. If you talk about collusion with Russia take a look at Christopher Steele, all his contacts with Russia which by the way she paid for, and turned out to be a phony deal, which everyone is now admitting that. No George, all I want is the truth.\u201d Facts First: Trump is lying about Clinton by making up allegations that she colluded with the Russians in 2016. He\u2019s also twisting the facts about the Steele dossier, and is creating a false equivalency between his team\u2019s contacts with Russians and Clinton\u2019s ties to the dossier. For starters, there is absolutely no evidence that \u201cClinton conspired with Russia\u201d like Trump claimed. Mueller\u2019s mandate was to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether any Americans - not just Trump aides \u2013 were involved in those efforts. The report said nothing about connections between the Clinton campaign and the Russian government or the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-connected troll farm that spread propaganda to US audiences. Trump then turned to the infamous Steele dossier, the series of private intelligence memos that former British spy Christopher Steele wrote in the final months of the 2016 campaign. The memos contained details about Russian meddling that pre-dated public announcements about Russia\u2019s activities by the US government. They also alleged that Trump colluded with the Kremlin. Some claims have been debunked, while others have held up over time; some remain unproven while others are partially true. Trump is wrong when he says it was all \u201cphony.\u201d One of the main claims in the Steele dossier \u2013 that the Trump campaign engaged in a widespread conspiracy of collusion with the Russians \u2013 was not established by Mueller. But the President is wrong that Steele is \u201csomebody that came out of Russia.\u201d Steele is a British citizen. He lived in Russia as an undercover spy, but his allegiance was to the United Kingdom. The UK is one of America\u2019s closest allies for intelligence-sharing. Steele\u2019s strong track record made him a trusted and valuable informant for the FBI and other US government agencies. Trump is also wrong that Clinton \u201cwas totally involved\u201d in the Steele dossier. There is no evidence that she was directly involved, and her campaign chairman testified to Congress that he didn\u2019t know about it before the 2016 election. But Clinton\u2019s campaign funded Steele\u2019s work. They paid a law firm, which hired an opposition research company, which brought on Steele. On Monday morning, Clinton tweeted a response to Trump\u2019s claims she colluded with Russia, calling them \u201coutlandish.\u201d Trump mischaracterized a key finding from the Mueller report. He claimed: \u201cMueller said that we rebuffed Russia, that we pushed them away, that we weren\u2019t interested. Read the report.\u201d Facts First: This is only half the story, and it is a very misleading representation of the Mueller report. Trump omitted the part where Mueller said that some members of Trump\u2019s campaign eagerly accepted meetings with Russians and even solicited their help on the 2016 election. Here\u2019s what the Mueller report said about this: \u201cIn sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Trump made this misleading claim. The whole truth is much more nuanced. Sometimes the Russians were rebuffed, sometimes they were welcomed. Trump\u2019s own son, Donald Trump Jr., eagerly took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 after being told that she was bringing damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Kremlin. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that any of these contacts broke the law. Defending his response to the Mueller investigation, Trump said he was \u201cthe most transparent in history\u201d and touted the fact that he provided Mueller with 1.5 million pages of documents. He also said \u201cI gave them four or five hundred witnesses\u201d to be interviewed by investigators. Facts First: It\u2019s true that Trump gave Mueller\u2019s team broad access to interview White House officials and read their internal notes, which proved pivotal to the investigation. But that group represents only a small slice of the 500 witnesses Mueller interviewed. And perhaps most importantly, Trump refused multiple requests from investigators for a sit-down interview. Whenever Trump touts his \u201ctransparency\u201d with the Mueller investigation, he never mentions his adamant refusal to agree to a sit-down interview. While Trump made his aides available for interviews, he agreed only to answer written questions about collusion, but not obstruction. Mueller made it clear that Trump\u2019s responses were \u201cincomplete\u201d and generally insufficient. There are many other reasons why Trump is not \u201cthe most transparent\u201d president in US history, including his refusal to release his tax returns and his fight to block Congressional subpoenas to gain access to his financial statements. Trump also exaggerated the number of witnesses he \u201cgave\u201d to Mueller so they could testify. Mueller interviewed 500 witnesses, but Trump could only control the testimony of White House aides. More than two dozen Trump administration officials voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel. The fruits of those interviews created the foundation of the obstruction inquiry. Federal investigators interviewed hundreds of people Trump didn\u2019t have any control over. For example, Mueller\u2019s team spoke to Russian banker Petr Aven, conservative author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, and the translator at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. However, to Trump\u2019s credit, he did not invoke executive privilege or go to court to prevent Mueller\u2019s team from interviewing White House aides of reviewing their documents. Trump claimed the Russians \u201cwere also helping the Clinton campaign,\u201d and later said Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cwould much rather have Hillary Clinton be president right now.\u201d Facts First: Trump is entitled to his own views. But he stands alone in his belief that the Russians tried to help Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. The US intelligence community announced after the 2016 election that the Kremlin tried to help Trump, a conclusion that has been endorsed by all of Trump\u2019s handpicked officials to lead the intelligence agencies. The stunning assessment that the Russian government tried to help Trump was made public in a January 2017 report featured unanimous conclusions from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The report was prepared during the Obama administration but Trump\u2019s appointees to lead these US intelligence agencies have endorsed the report and its findings. This isn\u2019t about collusion or coordination with the campaign. It\u2019s about the wide-ranging Russian campaign to influence Americans, largely in Trump\u2019s favor. For instance, Facebook acknowledged that Russian propaganda reached 126 million Americans on its platform both before and after the election. The Russians hacked Democratic targets and released their emails through WikiLeaks at pivotal moments in the campaign, including days before the Democratic National Convention and after the leak of the Access Hollywood tape that featured Trump making offensive comments about women. These hacks, carried out by Russian military officers, gave Trump a massive boost. On four occasions in his ABC interview, Trump used the word \u201cbloggers\u201d to describe Russian hackers. \u201cThey also said that there were bloggers in Moscow,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they said specifically about the bloggers in Moscow, had nothing to do with Trump, had nothing to do with \u2013 and there were like 32 or 36 bloggers. We have nothing to do with bloggers in Moscow.\u201d Facts First: They weren\u2019t bloggers. They were sophisticated hackers who worked for the Russian military, according to court filings. Trump\u2019s language downplays the seriousness of their actions, which Mueller himself described as \u201ca concerted attack on our political system.\u201d According to dictionary definitions, a blogger is someone who writes for a blog, which is an online publication or personal website that typically features commentary on a specific topic. The Russians hackers who meddled in the 2016 election were intelligence officers who worked for Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, known as the GRU. \u201cRussian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system,\u201d Mueller said in his only public statement about the investigation. Trump\u2019s comments diminish the role of the Russian government in the attack. Interestingly, Putin has also sought to distance the Russian state from the hacks, saying that \u201cpatriotic hackers\u201d might have meddled in American politics, but they were not directed by the Kremlin. That\u2019s just not true, according to Mueller, whose office indicted a dozen GRU officers. They were accused of hacking Democratic targets in 2016 and sharing the spoils with WikiLeaks. Stephanopoulos asked Trump how it was that several Republican senators who were initially skeptical of Trump eventually came around to support him. Trump pointed to the 2016 presidential debates and how, he said, \u201cthey found out I am very smart and I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d \u201cI had, what, 15 debates and we won every debate,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAccording to every poll, I mean I can only tell you by the polls. But every poll, they had many polls, doing many debates, I never lost one poll, I think they\u2019ve gained a certain respect.\u201d Facts First: Trump did not, according to polling, win every debate he participated in during the 2016 presidential campaign. In a Fox News poll on the first GOP presidential debate in August 2015, voters were asked who performed the best and worst during the debate. Fox News combined these scores, leaving Trump in last place with -13 points and Carly Fiorina in first with +12 points. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who watched one or both of the back-to-back debates in September 2015, Trump came in third, with 11%, behind Marco Rubio (14%) and Carly Fiorina (52%), when respondents were asked which candidate did the best job during the debates, according to a CNN poll. During the December 2015 debate among GOP presidential hopefuls, Trump\u2019s luck changed. He came in first in a CNN poll, winning with 33% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. (Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas came in second, behind by 5 points.) In a CBS News poll on the GOP debate in February 2016, Trump came in second (24%), behind Rubio (32%), among Republicans and independents who were asked what candidate they thought did the best job. Trump told Stephanopoulos that he won all 15 debates. Since there were 12 primary debates and three general debates, it would appear that Trump is also claiming that he won the three debates with Hillary Clinton. When looking at the three debates between Trump and Clinton, Clinton won all three debates, among all those polled by CNN. Among Republicans, however, Trump won all three debates, gradually going up from 55% to 68% and 74%, whereas, among Democrats, Clinton consistently stayed around 90%. When Stephanopoulos asked the President whether his drive to overturn Obamacare equates to abandoning those with preexisting conditions, Trump denied it. \u201cPreexisting conditions\u2013 I was for preexisting conditions. And I still\u2013 you know, I\u2019m very much for preexisting conditions,\u201d he said. Facts First: While Trump has continued to state his support for covering people with preexisting conditions, his administration is actively seeking to have Obamacare declared unconstitutional. This would eliminate the health care law\u2019s groundbreaking and very popular protections for those with less-than-perfect medical histories. The administration is siding with Texas and a coalition of Republican-led states that are challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in federal court. The Department of Justice initially argued a year ago that two key Obamacare provisions were no longer valid because Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0. Those two provisions \u2013 which ban insurers from denying coverage and from setting premiums based on health backgrounds \u2013 overhauled the nation\u2019s health insurance industry and allowed millions of Americans to gain coverage. Under Attorney General William Barr, the department went even further in pushing to dismantle the law. In a filing with the federal appeals court in March, the Justice Department said it agreed with the December ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the entire Affordable Care Act. (The law remains in effect as the case works its way through the courts.) If Obamacare itself falls, it would also eliminate the provision that requires insurers to provide comprehensive policies that cover a wide range of treatments, another key component of the protections for those with preexisting conditions. A coalition of 21 blue states led by California is defending the law. The Democratic-led House of Representatives has joined the effort, painting the GOP as hurting those with preexisting conditions. The two sides are expected to argue before a panel of appellate judges in early July. Trump also said he\u2019s formulating a new GOP health care plan that will be better than Obamacare. But the bills that Congress came up with in 2017 in the Republicans\u2019 failed attempt to repeal and replace the law would have also chipped away at the protections for those with preexisting conditions. The so-called \u201cskinny repeal\u201d bill that the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona helped to nix would have given states more flexibility in requiring insurers to provide comprehensive policies. The President continues to criticize McCain\u2019s famous thumbs-down vote on the bill in July 2017 This article has been updated. CNN\u2019s Grace Sparks contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House Intelligence Committee on Thursday issued subpoenas to two former Trump officials who pleaded guilty and cooperated in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The intelligence panel said it had subpoenaed former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The pair pleaded guilty in the special counsel\u2019s probe before cooperating with the investigation, and their testimony is cited in Mueller\u2019s report. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s decision to subpoena the Mueller witnesses signifies a new facet in the House Democrats\u2019 investigations into President Donald Trump, as it\u2019s the first subpoenas issued to targets of the Mueller probe. Schiff threatens to subpoena FBI director The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees are operating on dual tracks in their examinations of the Mueller investigation: House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has issued subpoenas to former White House officials who figured prominently in the special counsel\u2019s obstruction investigation, while Schiff has now subpoenaed officials cited in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. \u201cAs part of our oversight work, the House Intelligence Committee is continuing to examine the deep counterintelligence concerns raised in Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s report, and that requires speaking directly with the fact witnesses,\u201d Schiff, a Democrat from California, said in a statement. \u201cBoth Michael Flynn and Rick Gates were critical witnesses for Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation, but so far have refused to cooperate fully with Congress.\u201d The subpoenas to Flynn and Gates request they provide documents later this month and appear before the panel on July 10. The House Intelligence Committee has interviewed former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen as part of its sweeping probe that Schiff kicked off earlier this year, which is examining Russian election interference as well as Trump\u2019s finances and possible foreign influence. House approves resolution to enforce McGahn, Barr subpoenas in court Schiff had put off other interviews, including with Trump business associate Felix Sater, while the committee focused on obtaining the Mueller report. But Thursday\u2019s subpoenas are a sign that the committee is returning to its interviews as Democrats seek to highlight and publicize what was uncovered in the Mueller investigation. In the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation, the White House has directed those subpoenaed not to provide documents regarding their time in the Trump administration. The White House directed former White House counsel Don McGahn not to testify under subpoena, while former White House communications director Hope Hicks is appearing later this month behind closed doors but may not answer some questions because of claims of executive privilege. It\u2019s unclear how Flynn and Gates will respond to Schiff\u2019s subpoenas. Both are still under cooperating agreements with the Justice Department and have yet to be sentenced after their guilty pleas. Flynn retained a new lawyer this week who has promoted conspiracy theories about Mueller\u2019s team. The letter to Flynn includes a note about his cooperation with the Justice Department, which prompted the special counsel to recommend little to no jail time, arguing that the cooperation should include Congress. \u201cWhile the committee understands that your cooperation agreement with the Department of Justice only requires you to testify for the department, the committee is disappointed that you do not view your cooperation more broadly as an obligation to assist the United States of America, not merely the Department of Justice,\u201d Schiff wrote. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Democrats on Tuesday will twist the vise of accountability around President Donald Trump one notch tighter, marshaling the power of the House to compel cooperation from two of the President\u2019s men. The House Judiciary Committee does have a win to cheer after forcing Attorney General William Barr to make available some redacted material from the Mueller report after weeks of delays consistent with the administration\u2019s broad bid to frustrate Democratic oversight. The agreement staved off a formal contempt vote against Barr and will give House Speaker Nancy Pelosi new evidence to put before her restive caucus to show that her strategy of pursuing investigations over impeachment is working. Justice Department strikes deal with House Democrats over Mueller report evidence, Nadler says The House will instead vote on a motion to authorize the House Judiciary Committee to go to court to enforce subpoenas against McGahn, and if necessary Barr if the truce proves short-lived. The chamber will swing into action as Democrats intensify their bid to reshape the Russia scandal\u2019s political aftermath by alerting the public to Robert Mueller\u2019s shocking yet complex findings. But the resolution targeting Barr and ex-White House Counsel Don McGahn will also reflect their tough odds of ultimately inflicting real political damage on Trump. In a striking moment of television Monday, former Nixon White House counsel John Dean \u2013 a CNN contributor \u2013 told a House committee there were parallels between the conduct of his old boss and Trump. The appearance created a historical split screen featuring the older and younger Dean \u2013 a star witness who testified in 1973 that Richard Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up and helped bring down the President. Yet that slice of theater and other latest developments remain incremental steps in a long, slow slog toward retribution against Trump that seems unlikely to satisfy a growing Democratic minority demanding impeachment. Those tensions may be further stoked by the President\u2019s fast-reacting and political defense strategy, which also relies on a supportive conservative media to insulate him with his base. In one example of his tactics, Trump tweeted an attack against \u201cdisgraced\u201d Dean, who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in Nixon\u2019s White House but is now regarded by many historians as an important whistleblower. \u201cNo Collusion - No Obstruction! Democrats just want a do-over which they\u2019ll never get!\u201d Trump wrote. In what critics see as an even more sinister development, the Justice Department gave new details of the administration\u2019s plan to investigate the investigators who initiated the FBI probe into alleged links between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. The probe will be \u201cbroad in scope and multifaceted\u201d and will examine the conduct of US and foreign intelligence agencies, \u201cas well as non-governmental organizations and individuals,\u201d the department wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee. The agreement between Barr and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler offers something to both sides. Barr, one of the most controversial and powerful figures in Trump\u2019s Washington thanks to his handling of the Mueller report, escapes the stigma of being held in contempt of Congress. The agreement could also give the White House a talking point to counter Democratic claims that it is engaging in a massive attempt to obstruct their investigations. Nadler gets at least some of the redacted information he has been seeking, which he says he needs to act on the special counsel\u2019s product. Fights are still looming, however, over Democratic demands to see evidence pertaining to ongoing cases or grand jury material that is supposed to be kept under wraps. \u201cI think this is good but I don\u2019t think this is anywhere near what we want, and that is something we have to wait time to see if they will give us more,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee. \u201cAnd if they won\u2019t, we will go further,\u201d Cohen told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar. Despite the deal, the House will go ahead with a vote on a resolution giving Nadler the authority to ask a federal court to enforce committee subpoenas against McGahn and Barr. The White House has told McGahn not to comply with the demand for testimony as part of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s obstruction of justice investigation, after invoking executive privilege. A huge separation of powers conflict is looming following Trump\u2019s sweeping and unprecedented claims of executive privilege, and it seems likely to trigger a fateful showdown in the courts. The House resolution will mark a tangible step forward for the Democratic investigation strategy. The agreement will also potentially strengthen Nadler\u2019s hand in future disputes against the Justice Department \u2013 and will avoid, at least for now, the cost and uncertain outcome of court action. \u201cThese documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the special counsel,\u201d Nadler said. The clash over the Mueller report is just one small front in the wider effort by Democrats to investigate and expose Trump\u2019s campaign, presidency and financial life. Pelosi, mindful that Republicans in the Senate are highly unlikely to vote to convict Trump in an impeachment trial, is wary of pushing ahead with impeachment. She is seeking to paint a picture of corruption, malfeasance and incompetence through House investigations that Democrats can place before voters to argue Trump is not fit for a second term. Despite Pelosi\u2019s success so far in corralling most of her members behind her strategy \u2013 which does not currently include an impeachment inquiry \u2013 unease is simmering in her caucus. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said Monday that Democrats should press ahead with impeachment because Mueller had listed 10 instances of possible obstruction by Trump. He said Democrats should launch the effort in 2019 because it would be politically difficult to do so in an election year. \u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d Raskin said. But he added that Pelosi \u201cis a political genius, and I\u2019m not going to second-guess her political judgment.\u201d Fresh debate about impeachment follows an escalation of the personal feud between Pelosi and Trump. The President reacted angrily to reports that said the speaker had told House members she would like to see him in jail rather than impeached. \u201cShe\u2019s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person,\u201d the President said in an interview with Fox News last week. Dean\u2019s appearance Monday quickly degenerated into the typical partisan circus often seen in House hearings as Democrats sought to draw out parallels between Nixon and Trump and the President\u2019s Republican allies blasted Dean as biased and some members even seemed intent on relitigating the Watergate scandal. Dean, who had been called in by Democrats to offer historical perspective, maintained that the Mueller report offered a \u201croad map\u201d to impeachment, much as the Watergate scandal did for Nixon.

            "article_content": "House Democrats are planning to vote next week to empower committees to go to court to enforce their subpoenas, a move that will give committee chairmen a powerful tool to hold officials in contempt while bypassing the House floor. The plan is likely to expedite Democrats\u2019 efforts to fight the Trump administration in court over their subpoenas and could also help vulnerable Democratic lawmakers avoid repeated contempt votes on the House floor, although there are also concerns about implications of the precedent that\u2019s being set. The Democrats\u2019 resolution next week to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt and take those cases to court will also include language stating that committees can move to hold officials in contempt of Congress, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said this week. The resolution will also include language directing the House to petition the courts to obtain grand jury information contained in the Mueller report. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler pushed for the move in recent weeks as House leadership decided to wait to hold a floor vote on contempt for Barr until they could package officials together. Now committees themselves would be empowered to use civil contempt citations to go to court to enforce their subpoena. \u201cI think it is regrettably very necessary because the degree to which the White House is meddling in our oversight, instructing witnesses not to appear, making overbroad and insupportable claims of privilege means we don\u2019t want to have to go back to the House floor with every new act of obstruction,\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN. The resolution includes language for Democrats to pursue civil contempt in court against Barr and McGahn to enforce the subpoenas. It does not include a criminal contempt citation, which Democratic aides said was because criminal contempt of Congress citations are referred to the attorney general \u2013 one of the officials who would be held in contempt. The resolution does not change the House rules, according to Democratic congressional aides, as it states that committees can bypass the floor and go to court with approval from the House\u2019s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, which is made up of the three Democratic and two Republican House leaders. But the resolution effectively carries the voice of the full House, which could strengthen Democrats\u2019 hand if they go to court to enforce subpoenas that weren\u2019t voted on in the House. The aides said the resolution was designed as a response to the Trump administration\u2019s all-out stonewalling of their subpoenas. The House Rules Committee is marking up the contempt resolution on Monday, and the House is likely to vote on the measure on Tuesday, the aides said. The list of Democratic contempt citations could quickly grow. In addition to the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s contempt citations, the House Oversight Committee is also preparing to vote to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt over subpoenas related to adding a citizenship question on the 2020 census. Schiff had previously threatened \u201cenforcement action\u201d against the Justice Department before he struck a deal for them to hand over a limited set of counterintelligence materials related to the Mueller report. Hoyer said that the intention of the resolution, the text of which has not yet been released, was to \u201cto cover the universe and address what I referred to as one of the largest cover ups of any administration that I can recall,\u201d he told reporters. But the change also could have ramifications that go beyond the House Democrats current war with the Trump administration, and some lawmakers raised concerns about the precedent it would set for the future. \u201cI understand the notion, but I don\u2019t think they want to do it for future use,\u201d said one Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful tool for a radical chairman in the future.\u201d Democratic lawmakers and aides say that the effort is tied to the simple fact that floor time is limited, and Democrats are likely to have numerous cases where they have to fight to enforce their subpoenas in court. With court fights, timing is often everything. Once a challenge is in court, it\u2019s up to a judge how quickly a complaint gets handled. House court challenges over testimony and subpoenas in the past sometimes have gotten resolved in days or weeks, though it\u2019s more typical to take months. In the case of executive privilege fights, litigation can drag along for years. Nancy Pelosi's weird (and wrong) views about impeachment In recent weeks, lawyers for the House have accused Trump of attempting to use the courts to stall the fulfillment of House committee subpoenas \u2014 potentially even past the 2020 presidential election. And Nadler has yet to go to court to try to enforce his panel\u2019s subpoena for the full Mueller report and evidence until the House votes to hold Barr in contempt. \u201cThe rationale is we have an unprecedented order from the President to the executive branch, which is to disrespect all lawful orders from Congress for witnesses and documents and testimony,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat. \u201cSo, we obviously don\u2019t want to be tying up the floor every time someone disobeys a subpoena or refuses to turn over documents. So we have to delegate.\u201d Another added advantage for Democrats is that moving contempt only through committee avoids vulnerable Democrats already reticent about swirling impeachment talk from having to take repeated contempt votes on the floor. Republicans accuse Democrats of using the tactic to appease their base that\u2019s advocating for impeachment. \u201cThe Democrats are so without a legislative agenda that now they\u2019re having to just start bringing up contempt and all these to try to paint a picture because they can\u2019t show anything fruitful to bring to their base, so now they\u2019re just going to start having contempt hearings,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. It\u2019s still unclear how the approach may affect House Democrats\u2019 contempt arguments when they go before judges. Generally, courts are reluctant to step into fights between the executive branch and Congress. But at least twice previously, courts have overridden attempts by executive branch officials to avoid Congressional subpoenas. \u201cClearly this is a prelude to more litigation, and arguably less centralization,\u201d said Sam Dewey, a former House and Senate attorney who worked for Republican-led committees. Committee chairmen have already obtained more powers in recent years when it comes to subpoenas, after House Republicans authorized many chairmen to unilaterally issue subpoenas after consulting with a panel\u2019s ranking member. House lawsuits over subpoenas are a relatively new tactic. The first such case came from the Judiciary Committee against former White House counsel Harriet Miers about a decade ago in the investigation of the Bush administration firing US attorneys, according to the Congressional Research Service. Special committees like during the Iran-Contra affair also have had the power to sue. A Congressional Research Service report from 2017 cast some doubt on whether judges would entertain lawsuits from House committees without full House approval or a resolution. \u201cAbsent such authorization, it appears that the courts will not entertain civil motions of any kind on behalf of Congress or its committees,\u201d the report said. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.",

            "article_content": "On the 75th anniversary of a defining battle of the defining war of human history so far, it\u2019s clear that military service has never been less important to American voters. President Donald Trump, who is in Europe to commemorate D-Day, felt completely comfortable explaining his own lack of service in Vietnam because he didn\u2019t like that war, though at the time he said it was bone spurs. Trump said Wednesday he\u2019s making up for it by giving the military lots of money now \u2013 taxpayer money, that is. Trump-Macron meeting in Normandy: Look for fireworks Six US presidents served overseas during World War II, but none since President George H.W. Bush have gone abroad, if they served at all. At this point, we might get a President who served in Afghanistan or Iraq \u2013 that\u2019s South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard or Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton \u2013 but it\u2019s almost certain the US will never have a commander in chief who served in Vietnam. It has had three, including Trump, who found a way around the draft. That\u2019s old news, but it doesn\u2019t mean Trump won\u2019t still have to answer questions about it, as he did in Wednesday\u2019s interview with the British journalist Piers Morgan, who asked him if he would have liked to have served. The interview was conducted in the underground bunker where Winston Churchill led the British government during the Blitz and World War II. \u201cDo you wish you\u2019d been able to serve? Would you have liked to serve your country?\u201d Morgan asked. Trump replied by questioning Vietnam, mirroring some of the anti-war sentiment of the \u201960s and \u201870s. \u201cWell I was never a fan of that war. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever \u2013 you\u2019re talking about Vietnam at that time and nobody ever heard of the country,\u201d Trump said, adding the non sequitur that, today, the government of Vietnam has been successful negotiating in global trade. He went on to say that he wasn\u2019t active in protesting the war as a young man, but he didn\u2019t think the US should ever have taken part. \u201cBut, uh, nobody heard of Vietnam and then say well what are we doing. So many people dying. So I was never a fan of \u2013 this isn\u2019t like I\u2019m fighting against Nazi Germany. I\u2019m fighting \u2013 we\u2019re fighting against Hitler. And I was like a lot of people. Now I wasn\u2019t out in the streets marching. I wasn\u2019t saying, you know, I\u2019m going to move to Canada, which a lot of people did. But no, I was not a fan of that war. That war was not something that we should have been involved in.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments drew a stinging rebuke from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the Illinois Democrat and veteran who lost her legs in a helicopter accident while deployed to Iraq. Appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d Wednesday night, she called Trump a coward. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who has served in uniform, especially in combat, who would say they are a fan of war,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I opposed the Iraq war, but volunteered to go when my unit was deployed.\u201d She accused him of using wealth and privilege to avoid service. #CadetBoneSpurs: no one cares whether you were a \u201cfan\u201d of the Vietnam War. No one believes you were medically unfit to serve. You used your wealth & privilege to avoid serving your country five times, forcing another American to serve in your place each time. 1/ https://t.co/bSZbQlnWMf Trump said he\u2019s making up for his lack of military service by being President. \u201cWould you have liked to have served generally - perhaps in another (way)?\u201d Morgan asked. \u201cI would not have minded that at all. I would have been honored. But I think I make up for it now. I mean look, $700 billion I gave last year and then this year $716 billion and I think I\u2019m making up for it rapidly because we are rebuilding our military at a level that it\u2019s never seen before.\u201d This deserves a quick fact check. Trump did not personally give the military $700 billion or $716 billion. Congress did, when it passed appropriations bills last year. Trump signed them, and it is his administration\u2019s responsibility to now spend the money. But it says something about how he views his role as President and the dismissive way he\u2019s treated Congress and its responsibilities, that he takes personal credit for spending taxpayer money. It\u2019s also more than a bit awkward for him to argue that the military will be built up to a level it\u2019s never seen before under him when he\u2019s preparing to commemorate D-Day, when the entire country was mobilized in the war effort. More than 16 million Americans served in World War II from a US population of around 140 million in 1940. It was a total war, even for the US, which was far from any of the front lines. The portion of the population that served in World War II is much larger than the portion that served during Vietnam, when more than 8.7 million Americans were in the military from a population of 203 million in 1970. Despite the conflict in Afghanistan lasting longer than any in US history, fewer and fewer Americans have served in the military. The VA does not list a total number of service members during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are currently about 1.3 million people in the military, coming from a population of close to 341 million, according to Census projections. In the years after World War II, military service was almost a prerequisite for politicians and presidents for generations during and after World War II. Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and gave the order for D-Day 75 years ago, went on to serve two terms as President. He ended hostilities in the Korean War shortly after taking office. John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush all served in the Navy during combat. Jimmy Carter didn\u2019t deploy, but he was at Annapolis during the war, and Ronald Reagan \u2013 already a movie star \u2013 served stateside in the Army reserves. No more. Three of the last four US presidents \u2013 Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Trump \u2013 had no military service at all. George W. Bush was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard \u2013 his way around Vietnam. Two other politicians who were of military age during Vietnam are running against Trump as Democrats. They also deferred military service or sought to be exempt. All three are in their 70s, which makes it likely this is the last presidential election in which a Vietnam-era politician will be featured. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is running for President as a Democrat, applied to be a conscientious objector during Vietnam. The application was ultimately rejected, but he was too old to be drafted at that point. In 2015, he said during a CNN debate that he\u2019s no longer a pacifist. Sanders: I opposed policy, not soldiers, in Vietnam (2015) Joe Biden, the former vice president also running for President, received five Vietnam deferments for education and was later disqualified because of asthma. Trump also received multiple education deferments and he has also said he obtained a letter from a doctor for heel spurs, a condition that no longer afflicts him. By the time there was a draft lottery, determined by birth date, in 1969, his birthday of June 14 was not called. Sanders and Biden\u2019s birthdays were not involved in the draft lottery, cut off at 1944. Two other politicians who came of age during Vietnam are running in the Democratic primary. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee received a student deferment and had a high draft number for his birth year, as did former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Plenty of Vietnam veterans have sought the White House, including medal of honor winner Bob Kerrey, who did not get very far. Several Vietnam veterans got their party\u2019s nomination, including Al Gore, John Kerry and John McCain. Since the election of Bill Clinton over decorated former military pilot and wartime president George H.W. Bush in 1992, American voters have shown that avoiding service during Vietnam is not a dealbreaker. A real question in 2020 is whether it\u2019s a desirable plus. There has been no draft since Vietnam, and there have been many fewer Americans serving in the military. But there are multiple younger presidential aspirants who volunteered for the military and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gabbard has made her military service a centerpiece of her campaign and cites it as the impetus for her platform of disentangling the US from foreign conflicts. Moulton opens up about PTS: Extended interview Buttigieg also often cites his own volunteer service as an intelligence officer and his deployment to Afghanistan. He has criticized Trump for deferring military service during Vietnam. Moulton served in Iraq as a Marine and has spoken publicly about the plight of veterans and his own struggle living with PTSD after coming home. And the needs of veterans who have served in the Middle East are now front and center. There are more veterans who served in the time between the first Gulf War and now \u2013 a span of almost thirty years \u2013 than there are Vietnam veterans, according to Pew, although the percentage of Americans who served \u2013 7% \u2013 is much lower.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s coming from left, right and center, but the message is clear: The US government and the political mood are turning on tech companies for being too big, crowding out competition, violating users\u2019 privacy, squeezing government for tax incentives and scrimping on wages for their lowest-paid employees. For an industry that has sold big promises to disrupt old industries, streamlining the economy, bringing people together and making lives easier, the disruption may be coming back full circle. Government regulators have negotiated to split up oversight of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission moving toward a new probe of Google, according to reporting by CNN\u2019s Brian Fung. Frustrated that those regulators are moving too slowly, Congress, with support from Democrats and Republicans, will use its investigative power for a top-to-bottom review of the tech industry, and focus on the biggest companies. Congress cannot break up companies under existing laws, but it could cook up new ones \u2013 and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who\u2019s established herself as Democrats\u2019 big ideas leader in 2020, already has a plan to break up the largest tech monopolies. Warren\u2019s gripe is that the largest tech companies favor their own products, something known as \u201cplatform privilege,\u201d which crowds out every other player. But the problems are much bigger than that, and go way beyond antitrust investigations. Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, after Russia\u2019s internet attack on the US election in 2016, said this year that the internet should be regulated to ensure the integrity of people\u2019s privacy and of free elections. Facebook co-founder: 'It's not a personal beef, but it is personal' The same internet that has made the world smaller and brought people across continents closer together for commerce and communication has brought together extremists bent on terrorism and has spread conspiracy theories and other disinformation that is driving society apart. One person\u2019s meme is another\u2019s fake news, however. President Donald Trump has long groused, without concrete proof, that social networks bury conservative content \u2013 and even invited Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the White House to complain about it. The House probe will also focus on the effect tech companies have had on local journalism and other aspects of American life. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are everywhere in US life now, providing the phones Americans use to shop and connect with one another, the speakers that listen for their commands and questions, the cameras that watch their homes. Smaller companies like Uber, Lyft, Twitter and others are playing their own roles in reshaping how we move through the world around us and how we understand what happens in it. Unless and until they are swallowed or ended by something larger. \u201cThe open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment and new pathways for education online,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Monday. \u201cBut there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.\u201d A backlash to big tech has been festering for some time. People in cities have proved willing to fight tech companies and the inequality their fabulous salaries bring. Earlier this year Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats in New York used a grassroots political campaign to kill Amazon\u2019s plans to locate half of its new HQ2 in New York after a highly publicized beauty contest among cities vying for the right to host the company. Part of the gripe was the tax benefits and goodies Amazon had extracted in exchange for jobs from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2013 who is now running for president. That came after Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont led the effort to get Amazon to pledge to pay its workers $15 per hour. Amazon in particular plays a huge role in bringing automation to American life, which helps get products to your doorstep more quickly but is worrying many people that robots will replace human workers. But now we also find that the IRS is auditing Uber for two tax years, which the company disclosed in filings Tuesday before its IPO. Uber doesn\u2019t pay much tax, however, because it\u2019s never turned a profit. Amazon, despite its size, gets away with some amazing tax magic. Mark Zuckerberg calls for updated internet legislation The Supreme Court is letting iPhone users sue Apple for violating antitrust laws and creating a monopoly with its app store. It\u2019s not just consumer companies. The chipmaker Qualcomm was found in May by a federal judge to have violated antitrust law for overcharging phone makers. Time was, tech companies were the darlings of the American economy, and therefore of American politics. President Barack Obama dined with tech execs and happily took their campaign contributions. He used the Silicon Valley mentality to try to rethink government. Zuckerberg interviewed him at Facebook Headquarters in 2011 and the event was streamed live. Republican presidential candidates in 2016 bought into Uber and the gig economy. Jeb Bush said it would change the workforce and let Americans \u201ccustomize their lives.\u201d Now there\u2019s a backlash on the lack of worker protections, lack of benefits and low wages that make gig workers and American workers soak up more risk. And the public is starting to see the darker side of omnipresent tech companies that own their photographs, read their emails, know their habits and locations and serve up ads creepily related to their internet searches. Now more lawmakers and candidates are turning their scrutiny on tech. A turning point was the Trump election victory in 2016. Democrats still shout about the rise of fake news on Facebook, Twitter and Google. Conservatives have leaped to defend fringe voices kicked off social platforms as the companies have responded to fake news complaints. Democrats have seized on inequality as a campaign issue and tech billionaires like Zuckerberg and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos embody the excess of a gilded age for tech success. In the 1990s the government launched an epic antitrust case against Microsoft, which was forcing its web browser on PC users. That case lasted for a dozen years and ended with a settlement. But the fallout created space for the rise of Google and Facebook, now under scrutiny of their own. The European Union has previously fined Google $5 billion for requiring Google apps to be installed on phones running its Android operating system, solidifying its dominance. Sally Hubbard of the Open Markets Institute has argued on CNN that tech companies have helped chip away at antitrust law by arguing in court cases that consumers are not harmed by their anti-competitive practices. \u201cBut consumers pay for tech platforms\u2019 services with data, not dollars,\u201d she wrote back in January, explaining the view that tech companies are violating laws. She argued that while there are other social media platforms, it\u2019s not correct to argue Facebook doesn\u2019t have a monopoly. \u201cThe closest substitute to Facebook is Instagram, which isn\u2019t much of a choice since Facebook owns it,\u201d she wrote. It also owns Whatsapp, another competitor. And yet! The biggest tech companies remain popular. Except for Facebook and Twitter. In March, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 54% of Americans had somewhat or very positive views of Apple, 63% had similarly positive views of Google and 65% were high on Amazon. Facebook and Twitter, the social platforms, did not fare as well; just 36% of Americans had positive views of Facebook and 24% were positive about Twitter. While popular, they are not trusted. In March a CNN poll found 41% trusted the tech companies a great deal or somewhat to do what is right for the economy or for their users. Do you trust Alexa to not record your conversations? And this is the conundrum for lawmakers as they turn a more critical eye at how and whether to further regulate tech companies that have gotten so big and become so ingrained in the economy and lives of everyone.",

            "article_content": "Not even a sudden, silence-shattering prod from Robert Mueller could force Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hand on impeachment. But the special counsel\u2019s dramatic public statement Wednesday energized growing enthusiasm for a more aggressive assault on President Donald Trump among many Democrats even as the House speaker tried to hold them back. When Mueller noted that Congress, and not he, had the power to hold Trump to account and pointedly refused to exonerate the President of criminal conduct, momentum swiftly picked up toward a fateful political moment. Democratic presidential hopefuls demanded impeachment and liberal lawmakers grew perceptibly more restless as a media frenzy ensued. Then came Pelosi with the cold water. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring an impeachment unless you have all the facts,\u201d the unruffled speaker said in California several hours after the special counsel spoke on his last day at work in Washington. List: The House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump There may come a moment when Pelosi senses it\u2019s time for Democrats to move forward on the divisive business of seeking to oust an elected President. If not, her position \u2013 which appears to be running counter to the direction of her party\u2019s evolution on impeachment \u2013 could become unsustainable. While Pelosi still has the support of her most powerful committee chairs, the building political pressure means that may not always be the case. And the swift reactions of 2020 presidential candidates who have all spent weeks meeting party activists may be an early sign of shifting Democratic opinion. In Washington, the most successful leaders apply power through maximizing their leverage, mastering political timing and assessing the cost/benefit ratio of any move ahead of time. And Pelosi\u2019s public comments show she doesn\u2019t believe such tests have yet been met. The critical point could be reached when a true constitutional crisis erupts \u2013 should Trump for instance refuse an eventual court order to hand over documents to Congress. If the President\u2019s blanket policy of non-cooperation and aggressive assertions of executive privilege begins to truly threaten the bedrock principles of the separation of powers, things could escalate. Such moves might shift polls that currently suggest most Americans do not want the national agony of an impeachment drama for the third time in 50 years. But the pivot requires a shift in wider perceptions of the Trump presidency and will only come when Democratic leaders conclude that Republicans will pay more of a political price for shielding Trump than they will pay for pursing impeachment. Public sentiment can change throughout an impeachment process \u2013 it shifted perceptibly against President Richard Nixon in 1974 \u2013 but Pelosi is arguing America is not there yet. \u201cWe won\u2019t be swayed by a few people who think one way or another who are running for president as much as I respect all of them and they have the freedom to be for impeachment,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe have the responsibility to get a result for the American people and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201d The speaker\u2019s refusal to shift her ground is already focusing attention on her strategy. Democratic presidential candidates want a more robust offensive against Trump. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts warned that if Congress didn\u2019t act \u201cwe have fundamentally violated our duties under the Constitution, and changed how this country operates.\u201d Her 2020 rival, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said: \u201cBob Mueller was essentially referring impeachment to the United States Congress.\u201d Pelosi managed to quell calls for impeachment during a meeting with her caucus last week in Washington, pointing out several key court victories in the fight to investigate the White House. It looks like she may have to do the same again when Congress is back from recess next week. Democratic House members are \u201cgrowing more restless,\u201d one of their number told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Wednesday. Mueller\u2019s implication that he may have indicted Trump but for Justice Department rules prohibiting charges against sitting presidents seemed to strengthen the case for impeachment. He also rebuked the President\u2019s claims that his probe was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by praising the integrity of his team, and his comments clearly contradicted Attorney General William Barr\u2019s controversial summaries of his report, which helped to set a favorable political narrative for the President. Mueller\u2019s appearance sharpened the knife edge on which Pelosi is operating. She is caught between possibly irreconcilable responsibilities \u2013 keeping the House and winning back the White House for Democrats in 2020 which she sees as endangered by an unsuccessful impeachment push \u2013 and her institutional duty to confront apparent evidence of presidential abuses of power. There is queasiness among Democratic leaders who fear that an unsuccessful bid to oust Trump from power will only strengthen the President in the run-up to the 2020 election and will validate his norm busting leadership style. Trump and supporters downplay significance of Mueller's statement The White House is vigorously spinning Mueller\u2019s appearance as nothing new \u2013 and sticking to its line that there was no collusion or conspiracy with Russia by Trump\u2019s campaign and no obstruction of justice by the President. \u201cWe consider this very much to be case closed,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Her comments reflected the fact that Senate Republicans are no more likely to vote to cut the President loose in a Senate impeachment trial than they were before Mueller spoke. And Trump seems to be itching for an impeachment battle as a base stoking device. A source familiar with the President\u2019s thinking explained his attitude on impeachment to CNN. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. This fight will end up on our side. American people will see this as a scam. It is,\u201d the source said. Pelosi\u2019s position comes with risks. A trickle of Democratic members of Congress came out for impeachment following Mueller\u2019s appearance on Wednesday. So far, according to a CNN tally, 38 Democratic House members have declared for impeachment, along with dissident Republican Rep. Justin Amash. Some observers are warning that the Speaker\u2019s concern for political factors could be compromising her institutional role. \u201cMueller was sending a message to Speaker Pelosi and the House that they are constitutionally obligated to act,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University. \u201cIf the House fails to begin impeachment proceedings that would be allowing the President to get away with a crime and essentially would place him above the law, the inverse of the idea that we are subject to the rule of law,\u201d Brettschneider, author of the book \u201cThe Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents,\u201d said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump spread at least four false claims Wednesday about the conclusions and costs of the Russia investigation, while pushing back against Democratic leaders who are trying to pick up where special counsel Robert Mueller left off. Trump\u2019s misleading comments, some of which he has repeated many times, came during a fiery Rose Garden appearance that was supposed to be about infrastructure proposals but devolved into a screed against Democrats. Here\u2019s a breakdown of four of the President\u2019s false claims about the Mueller investigation. Trump: \u201cThe Wall Street Journal just wrote today, just a little while ago I saw it, \u2018Mr. Mueller wasn\u2019t obstructed in any way.\u2019 This is the Wall Street Journal editorial today.\u201d Facts First: The editorial cited by Trump isn\u2019t an accurate portrayal of the Mueller report. Mueller found substantial evidence of obstruction by Trump, though his hands were tied by Justice Department policies from bringing an indictment. The report also laid out how some Trump aides took steps that hampered the investigation, and others were charged with lying. The quote comes from an editorial published Tuesday, which offered blistering criticism for Rep. Jerry Nadler, the  New York Democrat who\u2019s the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cHe wants a show,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s editorial said. \u201cHe wants to use (former White House counsel Don) McGahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Mueller investigation. Yet Mr. Mueller wasn\u2019t obstructed in any way, his copious report was released for all to see, and there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\u201d Criticism of Nadler aside, the portion that Trump touted was about obstruction of justice. But the claim that \u201cMueller wasn\u2019t obstructed in any way\u201d is clearly debunked by the Mueller report itself. The report details a few incidents with \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Trump obstructed, including his efforts to fire the special counsel and have McGahn lie about it to the press. Prosecutors from Mueller\u2019s team went to extraordinary lengths to explain how they had everything they needed to charge Trump but didn\u2019t, at least partially because of the Justice Department policy of presidential immunity. Beyond Trump, the report said some prongs of the investigation hit roadblocks because some Trump campaign associates \u201cdeleted relevant communications\u201d or gave conflicting information. At least three Trump associates were charged with lying to investigators, which is an obstructive act, and two others were charged with lying to congressional inquiries about Russian meddling. Trump: \u201cYou can be transparent, or you can be tight. If you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, being transparent is better. So, I said, \u2018I did nothing wrong. Let\u2019s be transparent.\u2019 So that\u2019s what you have. \u2026 All of these things. 500 witnesses that I allowed to testify. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s true that Trump gave Mueller\u2019s team broad access to interview White House officials and read their internal notes, which proved pivotal to the investigation. But that group represents only a small slice of the 500 witnesses Mueller interviewed. And perhaps most importantly, Trump refused multiple requests from investigators for a sit-down interview. Whenever Trump touts his \u201ctransparency\u201d with the Mueller investigation, he never mentions his adamant refusal to agree to a sit-down interview. While Trump made his aides available for interviews, he agreed only to answer written questions about collusion, but not obstruction. Mueller made it clear that Trump\u2019s responses were \u201cincomplete\u201d and generally insufficient. Not only that, but the President also exaggerated the number of witnesses he \u201callowed\u201d to testify. If he wanted to, Trump could have invoked executive privilege or waged battles in court to prevent Mueller\u2019s team from interviewing White House aides or reviewing their documents. Mueller interviewed 500 witnesses, but Trump could control the testimony only of White House aides. More than two dozen Trump administration officials voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel. The fruits of those interviews created the foundation of the obstruction inquiry. Federal investigators interviewed hundreds of people Trump didn\u2019t have any control over. For example, Mueller\u2019s team spoke to Russian banker Petr Aven, conservative author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, and the translator at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Trump: \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. We\u2019ve been doing this since I\u2019ve been President. And actually, the crime was committed on the other side.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s reference to crimes committed by \u201cthe other side,\u201d presumably Democrats, isn\u2019t based in reality. Maybe Trump believes there were crimes, but the Justice Department hasn\u2019t charged any of his Democratic opponents and there don\u2019t appear to be any active criminal investigations. But six Trump associates were charged in the Mueller probe. Trump\u2019s explanation of the situation goes like this: Nobody on the Trump campaign did anything wrong, and the real \u201ccollusion\u201d crimes were committed by the Democrats. That\u2019s because Democrats funded the opposition research project that led to \u201cthe dossier,\u201d a series of private intelligence memos, written by a former British spy, that influenced the Russia investigation. The main problem with Trump\u2019s rhetoric is that this isn\u2019t where the facts led investigators. Mueller didn\u2019t indict Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or any members of her campaign. There were plenty of avenues for the special counsel to uncover wrongdoing by Democrats while he probed foreign influence in the 2016 election. One prominent Democrat, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, was indicted by other prosecutors after a referral from Mueller, but his case is about work he did for Ukraine with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. If Trump was right about his political opponents breaking the law, it\u2019s a safe bet that Mueller would have brought charges. They did, however, find wrongdoing by members of the Trump campaign and some of his top allies.. Mueller\u2019s team charged six Trump associates: his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; his former personal attorney Michael Cohen; his campaign chairman Paul Manafort; senior campaign official Rick Gates; campaign adviser George Papadopoulos; and longtime ally Roger Stone. Stone pleaded not guilty, while everyone else pleaded guilty or was convicted at trial. Trump: \u201cThese are the people that after two years and $40 million or $35 million \u2013 it\u2019ll end up being a lot more than that by the time all the bills are paid \u2013 this is what happened. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.\u201d Facts first: It\u2019s not clear where Trump is getting his numbers. The latest information from the Justice Department goes through September and it says Mueller-specific expenses were around $12 million. The final price tag will be higher than that, but the data isn\u2019t public yet. It\u2019s important to understand the data that the Justice Department releases to the public. There are some costs specific to Mueller\u2019s team. But there are other expenses that would have been incurred to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election even if Mueller weren\u2019t appointed. Mueller\u2019s team spent $12.3 million between May 2017 and September 2018. During that time frame, the Justice Department spent another $12.9 million on Russia-related costs. That\u2019s a running total of $25 million, though the price tag will be higher because that amount doesn\u2019t cover the last seven months of the investigation, which officially ended in March 2019. It\u2019s unlikely that the final amount will reach or surpass the $40 million figure claimed by Trump.",

            "article_content": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday rebuffed claims by House Democrats that his refusal to comply with a congressional request for President Donald Trump\u2019s personal tax returns is a violation of the law. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Mnuchin during a House Financial Services Committee hearing. \u201cI have been advised I am not violating the law. I would have never done anything to violate the law. Quite the contrary, I was advised had I turned them over I would be violating the law.\u201d Trump\u2019s top finance chief was repeatedly pressed by House Democrats over his decision last week to refuse to turn over Trump\u2019s tax returns under an obscure law that specifies the Treasury secretary \u201cshall furnish\u201d the information requested by the heads of the tax-writing committees. Mnuchin \u2013 one of the President\u2019s earliest allies \u2013 on Friday restated in a one-page letter that an April 6 request by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal \u201clacks a legitimate legislative purpose\u201d and that he is \u201cnot authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.\u201d Mnuchin defies House Democrats' subpoenas for Trump's tax returns The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that a confidential IRS draft memo last fall determined that the tax returns must be surrendered to Congress unless the President opts to invoke executive privilege. Mnuchin said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that he had not discussed the memo prior to the Post\u2019s story. \u201cI became aware of that when we got an inquiry from The Washington Post,\u201d said Mnuchin. \u201cWe are trying to find out who wrote the memo, where it came from, when it was, and why it wasn\u2019t distributed.\u201d He brushed off criticism by Democrats that the draft IRS memo contradicted the legal basis for denying Trump\u2019s tax returns, instead telling lawmakers that the memo was addressing a different set of issues than the argument laid out to Neal after consulting with the Justice Department. \u201cThe memo is addressing a different issue, and is not addressing the issue that we and the Department of Justice looked at. The legal advice we have relied upon \u2013 and I understand there are three branches of government, and when it comes to constitutional issues, there could be different interpretations,\u201d Mnuchin said in response to questions from Virginia Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton. Mnuchin also repeatedly denied any political interference in his decision-making around the tax return issue, stating that he didn\u2019t discuss the matter with anyone inside or outside of the White House, including the President himself. \u201cI had no conversations ever with the President or anyone in the White House about delivering the President\u2019s tax returns to Congress,\u201d Mnuchin stated a few times when asked during the hearing. NY state passes bill allowing Congress to request Trump's tax returns Neal has fought for six weeks to obtain Trump\u2019s returns in order to determine whether the IRS is following its policy of annually auditing the president. Mnuchin told a Senate panel last week that Treasury officials would be willing to help members of the Ways and Means Committee examine the process without seeing the President\u2019s returns \u2013 an offer the secretary said the committee hasn\u2019t accepted yet. Mnuchin\u2019s last appearance in April before the House Financial Services Committee ended in a testy exchange with the chairwoman of the panel, California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, in which he offered her unprompted advice on how to conduct a hearing as he mimicked pounding a gavel. Trump is the only president in modern history who\u2019s refused to voluntarily release his tax returns, and also to maintain his interest in his personal business while in office, prompting questions and lawsuits about potential conflicts. Several Democratic 2020 candidates have already released their tax information, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump. House Democrats have grown increasingly furious over repeated attempts by the Trump administration, including the Treasury Department, to block various congressional oversight efforts including over the President\u2019s tax returns, calling such efforts to undermine the probes \u201cunprecedented stonewalling.\u201d Trump has said the White House will be \u201cfighting all the subpoenas\u201d issued by congressional committees conducting oversight investigations on his administration. The White House has also instructed certain officials and staffers not to testify before Congress, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, who failed to appear Tuesday. The administration\u2019s rejection of the tax return subpoena is likely to set up a court battle between the legislative and executive branches that could go beyond the 2020 election. Neal has said he prefers to move to court without holding Mnuchin in contempt \u2013 unlike House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, who spearheaded a recent vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt. \u201cI don\u2019t see what good it would do at this particular time,\u201d Neal told CNN on Friday when asked if he would hold the Treasury department or IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig in contempt. \u201cI think if both sides have made up their minds, better to move it to the next branch of government, the judiciary.\u201d In the past, congressional chairs have taken the step to hold an official in contempt before going to a judge. During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Waters, at the request of Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, said she would consult with the House general counsel on whether Mnuchin should be held in contempt for refusing to furnish Trump\u2019s tax returns. \u201cWe are unable to address this at this time,\u201d said Waters. \u201cWe will take your question to general counsel and put it in writing and seek an answer from him or her to find out what the next should be. We will move on that as quickly as possible.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Waters could hold Mnuchin in contempt, given that her committee didn\u2019t issue the subpoena. Neal has already indicated he does not plan to take that step. CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The judicial branch just delivered a sharp jab to the chin of President Donald Trump, in a foreboding omen for his strategy for thwarting investigations that threaten his presidency. When a federal judge ruled Monday that the President\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars must hand over his financial records, he did not just deliver a win to stonewalled Democrats. He made a sweeping point about Congress\u2019 power to hold a President to account \u2013 in an argument that will reverberate throughout Trump\u2019s attempt to fend off an oversight offensive. Judge Amit Mehta said it was \u201csimply not fathomable\u201d that a Congress that is constitutionally authorized to remove a president did not have the power to investigate him. Judge orders Trump accounting firm to hand over records to Congress Trump is appealing the decision, and long court battles loom \u2013 so Monday\u2019s ruling was a setback in a much longer war, a factor that offers Trump a significant political advantage. And typically, his response signaled that he has no intention of backing down and will take each bout in his battle against Congress as far as he can, potentially to the Supreme Court. But Monday put down an early marker in the separation-of-powers feud between Congress and the White House and may hint at how other court battles between Democrats and Trump may pan out. \u201cIt is a good opinion. It sets a very good bedrock framework for how all of these skirmishes between House committees and the White House are going to go,\u201d Preet Bharara, former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d Depending on how the White House reacts to any eventual court orders that contravene the President\u2019s wishes, Monday\u2019s drama may also have brought a constitutional crisis one step closer. Former FBI general counsel James Baker told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Monday that Congress had not always exercised powers inherent in the Mazars case, and had over the years ceded power to the presidency. \u201cI think it is a recognition that Congress has a lot of power under the Constitution \u2013 that is just the case,\u201d Baker said on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cThis is them taking some of this back by trying to enforce this subpoena, so the ruling from the court doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team had argued that Congress is on a crusade to overturn material that the Democrats could use to embarrass him now and in the 2020 presidential election. But House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, called the ruling a \u201cresounding victory for the rule of law and our constitutional system of checks and balances.\u201d White House directs former counsel Don McGahn not to testify before House panel Democrats did not have it all their way Monday. Trump ordered his former White House counsel Don McGahn not to honor a subpoena to testify about the Russia investigation \u2013 escalating his show of defiance toward Congress. And McGahn confirmed that he would not show up for a hearing Tuesday of the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 which is now certain to turn into a theatrical venting before an empty witness chair. His lawyer, William A. Burck, argued that since McGahn was facing contradictory instructions from two coequal branches of government, he was compelled to side with his former client. But House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, told reporters: \u201cWe are having the hearing tomorrow and we expect Mr McGahn to show up pursuant to the subpoena.\u201d The blocking maneuver means yet another dispute between Congress and the White House is likely heading for the judicial branch, as the presidency becomes consumed by a forest of litigation. That may suit Trump, since it will put off the  political reckoning that may eventually come and could delay the release of documents he wants to keep secret \u2013 such as his tax returns. The White House appears to have far stronger arguments in the murky and largely untested area of executive privilege than the President did in his personal suit over his financial records. But one complication to Trump\u2019s arguments lies in the fact that McGahn was made available for hours of testimony already before Robert Mueller \u2013 some of which has already been publicly published in the special counsel\u2019s report. If Trump succeeds in thwarting testimony from McGahn it would potentially establish a precedent that Congress could never cross-examine a member of any president\u2019s senior staff. Democrats want to question McGahn on a mound of evidence that Mueller piled up suggesting possible obstruction of justice by the President, including the revelation that he had ordered the then-White House counsel to fire the special counsel himself. The President got more potentially troubling news with the release Monday of closed-door testimony to Congress by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen claimed in testimony in March that the President\u2019s attorney Jay Sekulow knew that Cohen\u2019s claim to Congress that the Trump Tower Moscow project had ended in January 2016 was false. Sekulow\u2019s attorneys said Cohen was trying to blame others and argued that it defied logic for lawmakers to take the word of a man who is currently in jail, partly for lying to Congress. Michael Cohen tells Congress that Jay Sekulow knew Cohen's testimony on Trump Tower was false Mazars, Trump\u2019s accountancy firm, will not have to comply with the subpoena for his financial records for another seven days, according to Judge Mehta. But to stop the handover then, another court will have to step in, possibly as part of the appeals process. The President reacted to the decision by politicizing it \u2013 painting it as somehow invalid because Mehta had been appointed by his predecessor. \u201cIt\u2019s totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge,\u201d the President told reporters. Trump\u2019s argument, a familiar one, suggests that he believes justice can be delivered only by a judge who shares his politics, a viewpoint that contravenes basic democratic principles. The President also resorted to partisan arguments that help him navigate Washington\u2019s political wars and please his base. \u201cThe Democrats were very upset with the Mueller report, as perhaps they should be. But, I mean, the country is very happy about it because there was never anything like that.\u201d But one lesson of Monday\u2019s ruling is that Trump\u2019s personal political arguments and evasions, though serviceable to survive a news cycle, tend to be far less effective in the courts.",

The revelations add some nuance around Flynn\u2019s time as a cooperator and raise several new questions about Mueller\u2019s obstruction probe. Here are 9 questions to get up to speed: People \u201cconnected to the administration or Congress\u201d left a voicemail for Flynn or his lawyer that \u201ccould have affected\u201d his cooperation with Mueller, court records revealed on Thursday. Flynn gave Mueller a recording of that voicemail as part of his assistance to the Mueller probe. The Mueller report mentions a voicemail that fits that description. The report says a call to \u201cFlynn\u2019s counsel\u201d was made in November 2017 \u2013 days before Flynn formally pleaded guilty \u2013 and it came from \u201cthe President\u2019s personal counsel,\u201d without naming names. READ: New court filings detailing Michael Flynn's cooperation with prosecutors In the call, Trump\u2019s attorney obliquely referenced Flynn\u2019s cooperation, asked for a \u201cheads up\u201d if he would implicate Trump, and said he should remember Trump\u2019s positive feelings toward him. \u201cIf\u2026 there\u2019s information that implicates the President, then we\u2019ve got a national security issue\u2026we need some kinds of heads up,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer told Flynn\u2019s lawyer, according to the Mueller report. \u201cJust for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can\u2026 remember what we\u2019ve always said about the \u2018President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.\u2019\u201d The Washington Post reported on Thursday that this call was made by John Dowd, who was one of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys. Dowd could not be reached by CNN for comment. Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s only other personal attorney handling the Russia investigation at that time, told CNN that he did not leave the voicemail referenced in the Mueller report. Other lawyers around Trump, like then-White House special counsel Don McGahn and White House counsel Ty Cobb, worked for the administration and would not have been labeled as Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal counsel\u201d in the report. Mueller\u2019s team didn\u2019t say whether this phone call amounted to criminal obstruction of justice committed by the President. But Mueller clearly considered that the phone call may have been an obstructive act, writing in his final report, \u201cThat sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn\u2019s decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation.\u201d Mueller didn\u2019t offer a judgment in his report or in the court filings about how Dowd approached Flynn. There is no indication from the Mueller report that Trump\u2019s attorneys were even investigated for crimes. Any speculation that Trump\u2019s lawyers broke the law with this phone call appears to be a bit ahead of the facts. Read and search the full Mueller report If Mueller believed he could investigate Trump\u2019s attorney, and if he believed that the call did cross the legal threshold for obstruction, Mueller or another prosecutor could have brought charges. The investigation is over, and nobody was charged with crimes related to this voicemail. It\u2019s not entirely clear why Mueller didn\u2019t analyze Dowd\u2019s decision to make the phone call. Was it that Mueller only wanted to look at the President\u2019s actions \u2013 and not others\u2019 \u2013 around this particular event? Did Mueller want to avoid a court tangle with Dowd? A footnote suggests Mueller determined any interaction Trump may have had with Dowd about Flynn as confidential and protected by law. \u201cBecause of attorney-client privilege issues, we did not seek to interview the President\u2019s personal counsel about the extent to which he discussed his statements to Flynn\u2019s attorneys with the President,\u201d the Mueller report says. (It\u2019s important to note that if Mueller wanted to pursue more investigation into the call as a possible crime, he may have been able to breach the confidentiality. Attorney-client discussions can\u2019t stay sacred if a client is asking an attorney to commit a crime.) What Trump's financial disclosures do, and don't, tell us Mueller ends his analysis of the voicemail inconclusively, saying he couldn\u2019t determine if the President directed Dowd to make the call. \u201cBecause of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn\u2019s counsel.\u201d Mueller, a former FBI director, homicide prosecutor, US Attorney and Department of Justice top brass, cared a great deal about investigating obstruction of justice. The special counsel ultimately produced 182 pages that looked at 10 situations where Trump may have obstructed justice. Mueller found, in several of these instances, that Trump could have obstructed the investigation and had reason to want to \u2013 meaning Mueller detailed evidence to support obstruction charges. But Mueller refused to decide whether Trump should be charged, leaving that decision to Attorney General William Barr. Mueller also wasn\u2019t afraid of going after liars whose false statements could have muddled the investigation. In all, he secured six guilty pleas that involved lying to authorities \u2013 from Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, to Michael Cohen, George Papadopoulos and Alex Van Der Zwaan, and including Flynn, too. Two other defendants in the Mueller probe have been charged with obstruction, and both of their cases are still unresolved. Those defendants are: Roger Stone for allegedly lying and threatening a witness and the Russian Konstantin Kilimnik allegedly reaching out to possible witnesses who could have testified against his business associate and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. There was more communication with Flynn than the one voicemail described in the Mueller report. Court filings indicate that there were \u201cmultiple instances\u201d of contacts between Team Trump and Flynn\u2019s camp, and Flynn provided investigators with information about these incidents. Now we know why Donald Trump was SO focused on Michael Flynn The Mueller report highlighted a few examples. Before Flynn flipped and started to cooperate, Trump asked some of his closest aides to convey messages of support to Flynn. This included his son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, Flynn\u2019s onetime deputy KT McFarland, and spokeswoman Hope Hicks. The court filings also said someone \u201cconnected to\u2026 Congress\u201d was in touch with Flynn about his cooperation. Based on the language in the memo from Mueller\u2019s team, it appears that this could be a Hill staffer or political donor and may not be a member of Congress. The person hasn\u2019t been identified yet, though that could potentially be revealed in future disclosures. The voicemail Trump\u2019s lawyer left for Flynn\u2019s lawyer was highlighted in the version of the Mueller report made public on April 18. The report was so rich in detail and covered so many investigative threads that parts of it didn\u2019t receive much initial scrutiny. For example: How Flynn\u2019s attorney became a witness in the Mueller investigation, to discuss the voicemail with Mueller. But scrutiny of Flynn is far from over. He has not yet been sentenced for his crime of lying to investigators, and federal Judge Emmet Sullivan has demanded transparency in his case. The Washington Post had sued to make public some information that prosecutors put under seal in the Flynn case, and Sullivan agreed. That led to the Justice Department\u2019s public disclosures on Thursday of previously redacted descriptions of his cooperation, and of FBI memoranda about their interactions with Flynn in early 2017. Trump weighed in on the situation with a tweet Friday morning, saying: \u201cIt now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this but, if that was the case, and with me being one of two people who would become president, why was I not told so that I could make a change?\u201d The President didn\u2019t mention the questionable backchanneling between his lawyer and Flynn\u2019s lawyer. But his tweet was misleading on other fronts and lacked some relevant context. Fact checking Trump's tweet on Flynn It\u2019s generally against Justice Department policy to publicly reveal ongoing cases, so it\u2019s no surprise that the investigation was underway before it was \u201ccommon knowledge.\u201d Flynn personally informed senior members of the Trump transition team in January 2017 about the investigation, and so did his attorneys. But it\u2019s not clear when exactly Trump was briefed. While Trump wasn\u2019t told by the Justice Department about the Flynn probe before taking office, he received at least two prominent warnings against hiring Flynn as national security adviser. President Barack Obama told him not to give Flynn a White House job during their post-election meeting. So did New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and one of Trump\u2019s close allies during the 2016 campaign. Senior Justice Department officials eventually warned the Trump White House about Flynn\u2019s conduct, primarily that he lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The administration waited two weeks after getting that information before Trump forced Flynn to resign. It appears several more revealing documents about Flynn may be public by June. Sullivan ordered that the Justice Department disclose in Flynn\u2019s court case the transcript of the voicemail and transcripts of Flynn\u2019s conversations with Russian officials. Flynn contacted GOP Mueller critic while cooperating with special counsel Mueller quoted the voicemail in his report, though he used many ellipses to clip sentences.  And the full text of Flynn\u2019s calls with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Trump transition has never been revealed \u2013 and may still be classified. Mueller has only paraphrased the exchanges in those calls in his report. And on top of all this, Sullivan has asked for the Justice Department to make public the parts of the Mueller report related to Flynn that are still redacted. The deadline is May 31.",

            "article_content": "Vladimir Putin keeps on getting the last laugh, and he knows it. The Russian leader and former KGB officer could not resist some sardonic trolling on a day when the tortured legacy of the 2016 election sowed fresh mistrust and discord in Washington and the US President\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., got caught in the fallout. \u201cDespite the exotic nature of the work of special counsel Mueller, we must give him credit,\u201d Putin said during a visit from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Sochi on the Black Sea. Emulating President Donald Trump\u2019s own language, the architect of Russia\u2019s election meddling operation said Mueller\u2019s report showed claims of collusion were \u201cnonsense,\u201d appearing to be only too happy to add to the fog of controversy churning over the former FBI director\u2019s conclusions. Trump claims he was \u201cexonerated\u201d by Mueller. But while the special counsel did not establish a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s team and Russia, he did unveil multiple contacts between the two sides in his report. And while deciding not to reach a decision on whether Trump obstructed justice, he piled up evidence that more than 800 former federal prosecutors said could lead to a prosecution of Trump were he not president. Donald Trump Jr. reaches deal with Senate Intelligence Committee for testimony in June Some 5,500 miles west of Putin, the still bitter reverberations of that divisive election tightened their corrosive grip over the institutions of US political life. Taking a break from worrying about a trade war with China and a possible slide to war with Iran, Washington plunged back into disputes raging in the aftermath of the Mueller endgame. Trump\u2019s team and Democrats are now fighting a war of attrition over Trump\u2019s personal finances, campaign and presidency that was born from the Russia intrigue and will further strain national unity. Which is presumably fine by Putin, since Mueller concluded Russia\u2019s nefarious efforts were designed to \u201cprovoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States.\u201d In one of Tuesday\u2019s most striking developments, sources told CNN that Attorney General William Barr is now working with the CIA and FBI leadership to probe the origins of FBI surveillance against Trump\u2019s campaign. An investigation into the same area by the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General is also under way. Trump improbably claimed he did not order Barr to open the probe, despite repeatedly pouncing on a long campaign by conservative media to turn the power of the law on FBI investigators. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a great thing that he did it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI saw it last night and they want to look at how that whole hoax got started. You know what? I am so proud of our attorney general, that he is looking into it. I think it\u2019s great,\u201d he added. The President\u2019s comment will do nothing to ease the impression among Democrats that Barr, who rolled out the Mueller report in a favorable manner for Trump, is acting less as America\u2019s top law enforcement officer than the President\u2019s personal attorney. Trump has burned through the hierarchy of top Justice Department officials at an alarming rate, and there were signs Tuesday that FBI Director Christopher Wray could be on thin ice. Trump was objected to Wray\u2019s refusal to adopt Barr\u2019s term \u2013 \u201cspying\u201d \u2013 for warrant approved surveillance of his campaign. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t understand that answer. I thought it was a ridiculous answer,\u201d Trump told reporters. In another bitter front of the Russia drama, there was a tentative breakthrough. Trump Jr. and the Senate Intelligence Committee brokered a deal for him to return for a closed-doors testimony in mid-June. The agreement comes after the committee issued a subpoena last month that sparked intense conservative blowback against the Republican committee chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell reported the impasse ended when the committee agreed to limit the scope and duration of the interview. The appearance will last between two and four hours and be limited in scope to five or six topics. But questions about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the Trump Tower Moscow project will not be off limits, said two sources familiar with the matter. It was the kind of compromise that offers something to both sides, and was a rare exception in today\u2019s Washington. The President had earlier complained his son was being victimized, by a rare committee led by a Republican to put pressure on Trump\u2019s inner circle. \u201cMy son spent, I guess, over 20 hours testifying about something that Mueller said was 100% OK. And now they want him to testify again \u2026 I have no idea why, but it seems very unfair to me,\u201d Trump said. The deal did little to cool tensions on Capitol Hill. Some Democrats immediately demanded more cooperation from Trump world, given the multi-front showdown over testimony and documents that has several cabinet officers facing a possible contempt of Congress vote by the full House. \u201cIt\u2019s about time that somebody from this administration or associated with this President is coming in freely,\u201d Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cI just wish they would do this across the board. This administration had one strategy, which is dodge, delay and lie to protect this President.\u201d Yet another development in the Russia drama Tuesday brought potentially troubling omens for the administration. A federal judge in Washington cast doubt on the notion that the courts could limit Congress\u2019 ability to investigate Trump, in the first major hearing over congressional subpoenas for records from the President\u2019s accounting firm. \u201cAm I right, there isn\u2019t a single Supreme Court case or appellate case since 1880 that has found a congressional subpoena overstepped its bounds?\u201d Judge Amit Mehta asked Trump\u2019s lawyer. \u201cI agree there are outer limits, but it\u2019s not clear to me what they are.\u201d Mehta said he would not rule on the subpoena this week. Mehta also noted how Congress has done historically important work with investigations in the past, like in the Watergate and Whitewater investigations. His comments were an early sign that the judicial branch could seek to side with the legislative branch as it faces multiple demands to referee Congress\u2019s showdown with the White House. Another legal wrangle intensified when it emerged Tuesday that the House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether attorneys representing Trump, his family and the Trump Organization misled the committee or obstructed its Russia investigation. The case arises from the a false statement to Congress in 2017 by Trump\u2019s now jailed former personal attorney Michael Cohen, according to letters obtained by CNN. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff warned that if any individual is allowed to lie to the committee, others could be encouraged to do so. Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that Schiff\u2019s document request would force them to violate attorney-client privilege. Back on the Caucasian Riviera, Pompeo brought up the question of election meddling directly with the Russians \u2013 with unusual clarity. \u201cI made clear to Foreign Minister (Sergey) Lavrov, as we\u2019ve made clear for the past months, that interference in American elections is unacceptable,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIf the Russians were engaged in that in 2020, it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it has been, and I encouraged them not to do that, that we would not tolerate that,\u201d he said. Putin\u2019s comment contrasted with Trump\u2019s still mystifying failure to publicly accept that election meddling happened or to confront Putin in any way about it. The reality of what happened in 2016 became even more clear on Tuesday as a Trump ally, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, revealed that a second county in the state had been hacked. But he added that there was no manipulation of data and said the the intrusion \u201chad no effect\u201d on Florida vote totals. He did not identify the counties involved. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Laura Jarrett, Manu Raju and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "It seems a crazy idea that any president would actually want to be impeached. But Donald Trump has so subverted Washington logic with his wild, norm-crushing presidency that there is now a serious conversation \u2013 at least among Democrats \u2013 about whether he views the ultimate constitutional crisis as a weapon in his re-election campaign. The possibility is shaping the strategies of Democratic leaders as they weigh the political risks of impeachment and their duty to defend principles of American governance. Many Democrats fear that Trump may be laying an impeachment trap that could consume the House majority, distract them from key issues like health care and alienate persuadable voters. But it\u2019s also possible their leaders could be talking up the idea that Trump wants to be impeached as a way to quell discontent among some base activists that Washington Democrats are not doing more to constrain the President. READ: Pelosi the pragmatist aims her party toward the middle The question is not going away, given Trump\u2019s staggeringly broad effort to subvert investigations of his presidency, campaign, personal finances and business career. \u201cThe President is almost self-impeaching because he is, every day, demonstrating more obstruction of justice and disrespect for Congress\u2019 legitimate role to subpoena,\u201d Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday. One of Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenants, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, is, like Pelosi, wary of the risks of impeachment. But he acknowledged Trump\u2019s own actions might be propelling Washington toward a precipice. \u201cPart of our reluctance is we are already a bitterly divided country and an impeachment process will divide us further,\u201d Schiff said Sunday on \u201cThis Week\u201d on ABC News. \u201cHe certainly seems to be trying and maybe this is his perverse way of dividing us more \u2026 He thinks that\u2019s to his political advantage, but it\u2019s certainly not to the country\u2019s advantage.\u201d Trump dodged a question in a Politico interview last week about whether he wanted to be impeached. And he argues that if anyone committed crimes over the 2016 campaign, it is Democrats, not him. At other times he has, however, seemed to be testing out arguments that he could use in his defense in an impeachment showdown. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to impeach somebody who hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and who\u2019s created the greatest economy in the history of our country,\u201d Trump told Reuters in an interview in December. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned, no. I think that the people would revolt if that happened,\u201d he said. Trump has unapologetically based his political appeal on widening national divides \u2013 so he is unlikely to worry about exacerbating them if it benefits him politically. And like everyone else, he reads polls that show that most Americans do not want to go through the trauma of an impeachment drama for the third time in 50 years. It\u2019s possible that the wider political divides get, the more Trump benefits. The spectacle would help him charge up the political base he needs to turn out in droves in 2020 with claims their 2016 votes were being stolen by political elites. Trump would also hope to turn more moderate voters against the Democrats by painting their efforts as cravenly partisan political overreach. A Democratic effort to oust Trump would bolster his narrative that his opponents have long been bent on a coup to oust him. This idea seemed to animate the President during a weekend of epic tweeting and retweeting. \u201cFrom long before I ever took office, I was under a sick & unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the Russian hoax,\u201d Trump wrote on Sunday. \u201cMy campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the Democrats. This never happened before in American history, and it all turned out to be a total scam, a Witch Hunt, that yielded No Collusion, No Obstruction. This must never be allowed to happen again!\u201d While special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, he did show repeated contacts between Moscow\u2019s meddling operation and the GOP nominee\u2019s team. There is also plentiful evidence of obstruction of justice \u2013 that more than 800 former federal prosecutors now say would have been sufficient to prosecute Trump were he a private citizen. Suspicions that Trump may perversely see an upside to impeachment are supported by a simple fact: It is very unlikely to force him from office. He has proven that there are almost no circumstances in which a two-thirds Senate super majority swelled by defecting Republicans would vote to convict him in an impeachment trial. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 building on a political narrative sketched by Attorney General William Barr \u2013 is framing the end of the special counsel investigation as \u201ccase closed.\u201d Much Democratic reticence about impeachment is shaped by a certain reading of the history of the Bill Clinton era. In midterm elections in 1998 that took place after Republicans had initiated the impeachment process, Democrats actually picked up House seats in a reverse of historical trends. The result has been read ever since as a judgment by voters to rebuke Republicans who sought unsuccessfully to oust a twice-elected President. Some Democrats fear that an impeachment process now could play into the current President\u2019s hands and allow him to rally the country against them. It is not often remembered, however, that Republicans went on to win the presidency less than two years after Clinton survived his Senate trial \u2013 after a campaign in which George W. Bush promised to restore \u201chonor and dignity\u201d to the White House in an oblique reference to impeachment. Despite the Democratic House majority\u2019s wariness about impeachment, the possibility seems more likely than ever. The White House is insisting its resistance to Democratic power is legitimate. \u201cThere are rules and norms governing congressional oversight of the executive branch, and the Democrats simply refuse to abide by them,\u201d White House spokesman Steve Groves said in a statement Sunday. White House decries investigations by House Democrats, says they are not following 'rules and norms' \u201cDemocrats are demanding documents they know they have no legal right to see \u2013 including confidential communications between the president and foreign leaders and grand jury information that cannot be disclosed under the law.\u201d Trump is ordering current and former officials to ignore subpoenas. He is refusing to turn over documents and personal files like his tax returns. And he has even taken personal legal action against a congressional committee to keep his financial records private. The President is also making what appears to be extreme claims of executive privilege. Despite this obstruction, the nation is not yet in a constitutional crisis. But the moment may not be far away. Many disputes between the White House and Congress are now likely to churn through the court system and could even rise to the Supreme Court. If the White House were to refuse a Court order to honor subpoenas, the Democratic House majority, having exhausted lesser powers to hold a President to account, may have no option but to proceed to impeachment to preserve the integrity of Congress itself. That possibility may have been in Pelosi\u2019s mind when she was talking about \u201cself-impeachment.\u201d The hope of Democrats would be that after methodically working through the process of trying to constrain a President, the public at that point would be less likely to react negatively to the initiation of impeachment proceedings. The party is already trying to build a case of administration-wide malfeasance and obstruction that could shape public perceptions about the Trump presidency. There is now talk of \u201cbundling\u201d several contempt of Congress citations for top Cabinet officials in one House vote to maximize the political fallout for the administration. Barr was found to be in contempt last week by the House Judiciary Committee for refusing to hand over an unredacted version of the report from special counsel Robert Mueller. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig could soon face similar censure after being subpoenaed to hand over six years of Trump\u2019s tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee. Given America\u2019s entrenched polarization, it seems unlikely that views of the President will shift dramatically enough to change the political calculation over impeachment. But historians sometimes point out that public opinion became more favorable to the possibility of impeaching President Richard Nixon as his administration\u2019s misdeeds were revealed by Senate Watergate hearings chaired by North Carolina Sen. Sam Ervin. In the end, Nixon resigned before he was impeached, a step it is impossible to imagine Trump emulating. Some Democrats seem to believe that a concentrated public airing of Trump\u2019s behavior, with testimony from central players like Mueller and former White House counsel Don McGahn, could damage the Trump presidency sufficiently to weaken him in 2020. One potential Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is ready to take on the risks of impeachment. \u201cCongress can simply not look the other way. There is no political convenience exception to the Constitution of the United States of America,\u201d Warren said in a swing through Ohio on Saturday.",

            "article_content": "Former FBI Director James Comey said Thursday that \u201cit sure looks like\u201d President Donald Trump had criminal intent to commit obstruction of justice during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. At a CNN town hall in Washington, Anderson Cooper asked Comey whether, based on the redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, he believed Trump had criminal intent to commit obstruction. \u201cIt sure looks like he did, in connection with a couple episodes \u2013 the direction to (former White House counsel) Don McGahn to get the special counsel fired is to my mind a flaming example\u201d of criminal intent, Comey said. \u201cThe President is not above the law, and I don\u2019t accept the notion that because the President is the head of the executive branch he can\u2019t ever obstruct justice in connection with executive branch activities,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThat\u2019s just crazy and a recipe for lawlessness,\u201d the former FBI director said. Comey\u2019s appearance at the town hall marked exactly two years since Trump fired him. His dismissal ultimately led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to continue the Russia investigation. Mueller wrote in his report that he could not clear Trump of obstruction of justice. The report details numerous cases in which the President asked his aides to take actions that would have obstructed the investigation but states they were unsuccessful because the aides refused his orders. The special counsel did not make a \u201ctraditional prosecutorial judgment\u201d on the obstruction of justice question, Attorney General William Barr said in a news conference before the report was released. Barr said he and Rosenstein determined the evidence was \u201cnot sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump invoked\u00a0blanket executive privilege\u00a0over\u00a0Mueller\u2019s full report, escalating a looming constitutional confrontation over the report between his administration and congressional Democrats.",

            "article_content": "Maybe what\u2019s going on with Trump and Congress and executive privilege is relatively tame, since it has to do only with a report on allegations of Russian election interference and obstruction of justice. When President Thomas Jefferson argued in 1807 that he didn\u2019t have to fully comply with a subpoena for documents, he was having his former vice president tried for treason for attempting to incite a revolution out West. The former-vice-president-turned-frontier-revolutionary on trial was Aaron Burr, of \u201cHamilton\u201d dueling fame. The Supreme Court, in the voice of Jefferson\u2019s foil Chief Justice John Marshall, disagreed with the President\u2019s argument, Jefferson ultimately coughed up the documents Burr wanted for his defense and Burr ultimately walked free. Fast-forward 170 years, and Chief Justice Warren Burger used the Burr trial in deciding that President Richard Nixon had to comply with a subpoena by the special counsel for his taped Oval Office conversations. None of these cases are exactly the same. Jefferson was responding to a subpoena in a criminal trial. Nixon was responding to a subpoena by a special prosecutor. Trump, in invoking a blanket claim of executive privilege Wednesday, was responding to a subpoena from Congress for the Mueller report. But they all share the idea that presidents should be able to keep secrets from Congress in order to do their jobs. The term itself \u2013 executive privilege \u2013 dates back only to the Eisenhower administration. And while it isn\u2019t in the Constitution, the idea has been a matter of considerable debate since George Washington first employed it with regard to congressional inquiries about the postwar Jay Treaty of 1795 between the US and Great Britain. This is not a secret or under-analyzed subject. Books upon books have been written about it and just about every recent generation has had a knock-down crisis moment fight about it, particularly when presidents have used the idea of executive privilege to cover up missteps. \u201cThe weakest claims of executive privilege involve administrations attempting to cover up embarrassing or politically inconvenient information, or even outright wrongdoing,\u201d write Mark Rozell of George Mason University and Mitchel Sollenberger of the University of Michigan-Dearborn in one study. They point out, however, that there is a sound need for the president to get candid advice and also to keep information from the public. \u201cPresidents rely heavily on being able to consult with advisers, without fear of public disclosure of their deliberations,\u201d write Rozell and Sollenberger. \u201cExecutive privilege recognizes this notion. Indeed, in U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court not only recognized the constitutionality of executive privilege, but the occasional need for secrecy to the operation of the presidency.\u201d What Watergate and Whitewater tell us about Trump's drip, drip, drip In his memoirs, Nixon expressed regret that he had weakened the principle. \u201cI was the first president to test the principle of executive privilege in the Supreme Court, and by testing it on such a weak ground, I probably ensured the defeat of my cause,\u201d he wrote. There has been an ebb and flow ever since. President Ronald Reagan sought to expand the idea. Bill Clinton tried to use it more than any other president since Watergate as he fought the Whitewater investigation and dealt with fallout from the Monica Lewinsky affair, according to the academics. He ultimately dropped the claim of executive privilege in regard to testimony to Congress about Lewinsky. Congress considered but ultimately did not move on an impeachment charge against Clinton having to do with abuse of executive privilege, according to Rozell and Sollenberger. Clinton invoked executive privilege 14 times, according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service in 2012, more than twice the tally of any other modern president. President George W. Bush tried to expand it even further and strengthen the power of the presidency. He signed an executive order that gave the current president the ability to assert executive privilege over the documents of previous presidents. He also got into snits with Congress over using the idea to shield top aides like Karl Rove from congressional testimony. Back then, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta reported on where Congress might put someone like Rove in jail if it tried to arrest him.  (Yes, Congress can technically arrest people, but it hasn\u2019t tried in more than 70 years.) President Barack Obama made a big deal of rolling back Bush\u2019s view of executive privilege, but then he asserted it himself on behalf of his attorney general, Eric Holder, who was held in contempt of court over the Fast and Furious gun sale scandal. A federal judge ultimately made Holder turn over documents. Trump\u2019s assertion, however, is a blanket assertion of privilege for anything relating to the special counsel report on the Russia investigation. It\u2019s nontraditional in some ways, since privilege is usually asserted for close aides and in Trump\u2019s case it is for an investigation into his administration and 2016 political campaign. It\u2019s also very broad, and seemingly pertains in a protective way to all congressional inquiries related to Mueller. READ: Trump asserts executive privilege over unredacted Mueller report, Justice Department letter says \u201cThis protective assertion of executive privilege ensures the President\u2019s ability to make a final decision whether to assert privilege following a full review of these materials,\u201d wrote Stephen Boyd, a Justice Department official, in a letter Wednesday to the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cExecutive privilege claims customarily come with an underlying rationale such as national security, protecting internal deliberations or protecting ongoing DOJ investigations,\u201d Rozell told CNN in an email. \u201cIn this case the President has claimed some \u2018protective\u2019 executive privilege which is entirely too broad and without any precedent (excepting equally broad claims such as President Nixon\u2019s that failed the constitutional standard). It seems the President believes he can wall off any and all information or testimony by merely uttering the words \u2018executive privilege.\u2019 \u201c One problem for Democrats right now is that they have asked for essentially every document related to the Mueller report, something they may not ever get. Timothy Naftali, a New York University historian who\u2019s the former head of the Nixon presidential library, said Wednesday on CNN that they should be more specific and detailed in their requests. \u201cI think at this moment a lot of Americans are just seeing the Republicans and Democrats screaming at each other, and the details \u2013 which are so important \u2013 are being lost,\u201d he said, arguing that Trump is making his broad claim of privilege because he thinks most people will see only the political back and forth rather than understand what, specifically, Democrats are trying to get. \u201cUsually disputes over executive privilege get resolved through an accommodation process between Congress and the White House,\u201d Rozell observed. \u201cWe seem to be stuck now in a zero-sum game with each side digging in.\u201d Regardless, this is now a fight destined for the courts. And these things take time. It took a year from the time Nixon refused to release the tapes till the Supreme Court ruled against him. It was four years from the time Obama made his executive privilege claim regarding Fast and Furious before a judge rejected it. And even then the legal fight over the documents continued into the Trump administration. Indeed, just on Wednesday the Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington that they had reached a settlement in the Fast and Furious court case.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump invoked blanket executive privilege over Robert Mueller\u2019s full report Wednesday in retribution for a pending vote by House Democrats to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress. The move significantly escalated a constitutional confrontation between the House Democratic majority and the President over the aftermath of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation. It will trigger a bitter and potentially long battle in the courts to adjudicate whether the executive branch or the legislative branch of the government will prevail. The Justice Department informed House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler Wednesday morning in a letter that the \u201cPresident has asserted executive privilege over the entirety of the subpoenaed materials.\u201d Nadler had previously subpoenaed Barr to require the handover of a full, unredacted version of the Mueller report that the public has yet to see as well as supporting evidence gathered by Mueller. Trump invokes executive privilege minutes before House panel contempt vote on Barr White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made clear the decision was a direct response to a scheduled vote in the committee to hold Barr in contempt over his refusal to accept Nadler\u2019s demands \u2013 after releasing a redacted public version of the report last month. \u201cFaced with Chairman Nadler\u2019s blatant abuse of power, and at the attorney general\u2019s request, the President has no other option than to make a protective assertion of executive privilege,\u201d Sanders said. Assertions of executive privilege are often used to shield materials held within the executive branch from production to another branch of government or the general public. The hard-to-define and rarely litigated concept is often justified on the grounds that withholding information from public disclosure protects the President\u2019s ability to get private advice from his subordinates to ensure the functioning of government. Barr sent a letter dated Wednesday to the President, requesting he make a protective assertion of executive privilege with respect to the documents the House committee subpoenaed. The decision is a \u201cprotective assertion\u201d of privilege \u2013 which would allow the evaluation of individual requests for information down the road. But it raises the question of why Trump is so keen to prevent the full disclosure of a report that he claimed offers him \u201ccomplete and total exoneration,\u201d an assertion not supported by the facts. The Mueller report did not establish a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 and a Russian election meddling effort. And Mueller did not come to a definitive conclusion about whether the President obstructed justice \u2013 despite laying out evidence for and against such a finding. Read and search the full Mueller report But Democrats are accusing the President of using executive privilege to cover up an investigation that shows that he is guilty of wrongdoing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday mocked Barr for having a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d over demands for more disclosure about the special counsel report. And Nadler said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that the attorney general had now proven that his priority was to abet the administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness.\u201d \u201cAttorney General Barr has \u2026 gone from being a personal attorney to the President instead of the attorney general of the United States and he\u2019s now gone a step further and made the entire Justice Department an agency for enabling the President to defy the law, to defy any type of accountability and to act as a monarch, to say that Congress can have no role in accountability,\u201d Nadler said. In his letter to the President, Barr explained that \u201calthough the subpoenaed materials assuredly include categories of information within the scope of executive privilege,\u201d they may not all be protected by the privilege, and that ultimate determination will likely be for a federal judge to decide. In the meantime, the real question will be whether the House can successfully proceed with calling witnesses involved in the investigation. Democrats are hoping to secure testimony of Mueller himself, possibly as soon as next week. Trump\u2019s assertion of protective executive privilege over subpoenaed documents has no direct bearing on Mueller testifying before the House, according to a Justice Department official. From a practical standpoint, however, whether a legal battle over the underlying documents affects Mueller\u2019s testimony remains to be seen. The official further disagreed with Nadler\u2019s assertion that the President waived executive privilege by providing materials to Mueller in the first place, saying there is past precedent for providing materials to law enforcement. Nadler set Wednesday\u2019s Judiciary Committee vote to hold Barr in contempt after the attorney general did not agree to comply with a subpoena for the documents by Monday\u2019s 9 a.m. ET deadline. If the committee finds against Barr, likely on partisan lines, a contempt report would be sent to the full House for a vote. During Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Nadler said the Justice Department was heading in the wrong direction with its \u201cdramatic step\u201d in asking Trump to invoke protective assertion of executive privilege. \u201cBesides misapplying the doctrine of executive privilege \u2013 since the White House waived these privileges long ago, and the Department seemed open to sharing these materials with us just yesterday \u2013 this decision represents a clear escalation in the Trump Administration\u2019s blanket defiance of Congress\u2019s constitutionally mandated duties,\u201d Nadler said in his opening statement. Last month, the Justice Department released a redacted version of the Mueller report to the public, and a version with fewer redactions to a limited number of members of Congress. It did not release the supporting evidence underlying the Special Counsel\u2019s deliberations. Barr redacted four types of information from the Mueller report: grand jury material, classified information, material tied to ongoing investigations, and information that could harm \u201cperipheral third parties.\u201d The Justice Department offered on Tuesday to allow more staffers to view the less-redacted version that was made available to select congressional leaders, but Democrats rejected the department\u2019s offer. Instead, they requested that the Justice Department commit to working with the committee to go to court to obtain grand jury material \u2013 or at least not oppose the committee\u2019s effort to do so, according to a committee spokesman. Democrats have said they are entitled to view grand jury material, but Barr has maintained he\u2019s not legally allowed to provide that material to Congress. They also requested a meeting this week to discuss providing the committee access to Mueller\u2019s evidence and that the full membership of the judiciary and intelligence committees should be able to view the less-redacted report. Democrats have said they need Mueller\u2019s evidence, specifically citing in a letter last week the FBI\u2019s witness interviews and contemporaneous notes that witnesses provided to the special counsel\u2019s team, which is cited throughout the report.

BIG deal! Barr\u2019s in real trouble now, right? He is not. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! There are actual punishments for being in contempt of Congress \u2013 the Senate or House sergeant at arms can detain the contemptuous person! \u2013 but, in practical terms, none of them will be visited upon the attorney general. He\u2019s not going to be jailed for not turning over the full Mueller report \u2013 which he says he can\u2019t legally do because it contains grand jury testimony that is illegal to make public without the permission of the witnesses. And even if Congress did ask the White House to authorize a criminal contempt charge for Barr, there\u2019s roughly a 0% chance that President Donald Trump would agree to it. Bill Barr\u2019s life after this contempt citation will be the exact same as it was before the Judiciary Committee vote. If anything, his standing in the eyes of Trump will be bolstered. Trump has never understood \u2013 or tried to understand \u2013 the role Congress plays in our tripartite system of government. He views Congress\u2019 attempts at oversight as a nuisance at best and a willful undermining of his presidency at worst. So why did Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-New York, spend time working to pass a toothless measure? For two reasons: 1) Base service. Nadler wants the liberal base to know he is holding the administration\u2019s collective feet to the fire. 2) Legal positioning: Nadler knew the contempt citation wasn\u2019t worth the paper it was printed on. But he also knew that by moving to hold Barr in contempt, he would likely force the the White House\u2019s hand one way or another. And he did! In the moments before Nadler\u2019s committee held its contempt vote, the White House declared executive privilege over the entire Mueller report. \u201cFaced with Chairman Nadler\u2019s blatant abuse of power, and at the attorney general\u2019s request, the President has no other option than to make a protective assertion of executive privilege,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement explaining the move. (The White House argument, like that of Republicans on Judiciary, is that Barr cannot legally release grand jury testimony \u2013 and, by complying with Nadler\u2019s request, he would be doing so.) \u201cChairman Nadler is asking the Attorney General of the United States to break the law and commit a crime by releasing information that he knows he has no legal authority to have,\u201d Sanders added. The declaration of executive privilege represents a significant ramping-up of already ramped-up tensions between the White House and Congress. All of this comes hard on the news earlier this week that the Treasury Department would not comply with a request for Trump\u2019s tax returns from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts. It also follows Trump\u2019s tweet that he didn\u2019t think Mueller should testify before Congress about his report and the White House\u2019s instruction to former counsel Don McGahn to not comply with Democratic requests to testify about his role in the Russia probe. It remains unclear what impact the executive privilege claim will have on the ongoing congressional investigations \u2013 although Nadler signaled on \u201cNew Day\u201d Wednesday that such a move could complicate the prospect of Mueller testifying. \u201cWell, now that the President has said what he said, I\u2019m less confident than I was,\u201d Nadler said of the special counsel appearing before his committee. Today, then, like lots of days of late in political Washington, was lots of sound and fury signifying, if not nothing, then TBD. There is little question we are headed for a dramatic legal showdown over the proper oversight role for Congress to play \u2013 and Wednesday\u2019s hearing was a scene in that broader play. But don\u2019t expect to see Bill Barr in manacles anytime soon. CORRECTION: This headline has been updated to reflect that Barr was voted in contempt of Congress by the House Judiciary Committee.",

            "article_content": "William Barr must be about to set some kind of record. Less than three months on from his Valentine\u2019s Day swearing-in ceremony, the conservative legal stalwart could be hours from becoming one of the most polarizing attorneys general in history. Unless there\u2019s a last minute deal with Barr, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler plans to hold a vote Wednesday declaring the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official in contempt of Congress, in a dispute over his handling of the Mueller report. If approved by the committee, the contempt report would go to the full House, where Democrats have a 38-seat majority. Nadler declared on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that the US is in a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d over the impasse. He added, \u201cWe are in one because the President is disobeying the law, is refusing all information to Congress.\u201d The move will escalate the already grave constitutional collision between Democrats and the White House \u2013 and push the nation closer to a post-Russia investigation legal morass. \u201cWe live in strange times,\u201d Barr declared on Tuesday. He had that right \u2013 though Democrats will scoff at Barr\u2019s warning that the Justice Department must remain a \u201cbeacon,\u201d given his hugely controversial conduct over the last few weeks. FBI Director Wray distances himself from Barr's use of 'spying' on Trump campaign Barr\u2019s extraordinary tenure has become a metaphor for the political dislocation and perilous constitutional waters facing the nation at the conclusion of the Russia investigation. Unable, or unwilling to land a significant punch on the President, House Democrats are narrowing their sights on Trump\u2019s top current and former officials. Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Don McGahn is also in danger of being censured by the Democratic House  \u2013 after the White House told him not to hand over documents relevant to the Russia investigation. \u201cI fully expect that the Committee will hold Mr. McGahn in contempt if he fails to appear before the Committee, unless the White House secures a court order directing otherwise,\u201d Nadler wrote to McGahn\u2019s attorney on Tuesday. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin may be close behind after telling Democrats they had no legal basis to force the disclosure of the President\u2019s tax returns. The New York Times reported on 10 years of Trump\u2019s tax documents Tuesday night, revealing that his businesses lost more than $1 billion between 1985 and 1994 \u2013 a look into Trump\u2019s finances that might explain exactly why his administration is working so hard to keep Democrats from prying deeply into the President\u2019s records. Kamala Harris wants IG to investigate if Barr opened probes into Trump enemies at White House request Barr has become the most inflammatory symbol, apart from the President, of an administration that critics see as tearing at constitutional norms that have stood for generations. Democrats are furious that Barr shaped the political narrative of the Mueller report rollout in a way that favored Trump and even dismayed the special counsel himself. First, the attorney general sent Congress a letter laying out what he said were Mueller\u2019s bottom lines. Barr said no conspiracy was established between Trump\u2019s team and Russia in the 2016 election and interpreted evidence gathered by Mueller to argue there was no obstruction case to answer. Then Barr held a news conference last month prior to issuing a redacted version of the Mueller report to the public. His move allowed Trump to get a jump on his \u201cno collusion, no obstruction\u201d narrative. But the report turned out to be far less clear cut, especially on the obstruction issue, than Barr let on. Barr\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week also infuriated Democrats who believe he lied to Congress when he said he didn\u2019t know what Mueller thought about his summary of the report, even though the special counsel wrote to him to say it was lacking on context and substance in March. Democrats also accused Barr of playing into the conspiracy theories of the President and conservative media when he described FBI surveillance of a Trump campaign associate in 2016 as \u201cspying.\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray distanced himself from such terminology during a Capitol HIll hearing on Tuesday. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the term I would use,\u201d Wray said. The swift march to a contempt charge is also causing scrutiny of the Democratic Party\u2019s efforts to leverage its new House majority to contain and humble Trump. Nadler could have had Barr before him last week had he not insisted that he face questions from committee counsels. And Republicans say that Barr would be breaking the law by turning over grand jury testimony. They also argue his actions are well within the scope of conduct by previous attorneys general under pressure from Congress. Negotiations between Nadler and Barr\u2019s teams designed to head off the prospect of a contempt vote broke down on Tuesday. \u201cStill scheduled,\u201d Barr said when asked whether the measure was still on. In yet another escalation, the Department of Justice informed Nadler in a letter late Tuesday night that it will ask Trump to invoke executive privilege in order to keep the full, unredacted Mueller report and the underlying evidence from being released to Congress, should Nadler hold the contempt vote on Wednesday. Barr would not be the first attorney general censured with a contempt vote. Republicans did the same to President Barack Obama\u2019s Attorney General Eric Holder over the Fast and Furious controversy. Holder continued to serve unhindered in his post, and litigation surrounding the contempt charge dragged on for years in a way that dampened its political potency. While being held in contempt by a congressional committee would be a stain on a long legal career, it would also earn Barr a badge of honor from Trump and his supporters. The specific arguments surrounding the possible contempt charge against Barr are paling in comparison to the political stakes at play that seem to rise by the hour. Given their reluctance to impeach Trump \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned Tuesday he was trying to goad Democrats into such a step \u2013 targeting top presidential aides may be the next best thing. \u201cEvery day, he\u2019s obstructing justice by saying this one shouldn\u2019t testify and that one shouldn\u2019t testify and the rest,\u201d Pelosi said at an event hosted by Cornell University. Democratic leaders see polls that show Americans are not ready for the divisive spectacle of an impeachment vote and hope to use their majority to peel layer by layer from Trump\u2019s presidency to portray it as too corrupt to win a second term. But the party may have to explain why, if the President is openly obstructing justice and abusing his powers, they are not using their ultimate weapon \u2013 impeachment \u2013 to stop him and whether they are being negligent in their constitutional duty. Divides are already opening up between Democratic leaders in Washington and in the presidential race. But the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s pursuit of the attorney general is also offering fodder for Republicans eager to paint Democrats as seeking any excuse to target a Trump associate. \u201cDemocrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the President and the special counsel,\u201d said the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Doug Collins. The assault on Barr also seems to be convincing many Republicans to close ranks behind the administration, reflecting the fact that Democrats have no chance to oust Trump in a Senate trial even if they impeach him in the House. Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday staged one of his big political interventions designed to shift the Washington narrative, declaring \u201ccase closed\u201d on Russia. \u201cTwo years of exhaustive investigation and nothing to establish the fanciful conspiracy theory that Democratic politicians and TV talking heads had treated like a foregone conclusion,\u201d McConnell said.

Barr Before the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate May 1, 2019 Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today to discuss the conclusion of the investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III, and the confidential report he submitted to me, which I recently released to the public after applying necessary redactions. When I appeared before this Committee just a few months ago for my confirmation hearing, Senators asked for two commitments concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation: first, that I would allow the Special Counsel to finish his investigation without interference; and second, that I would release his report to Congress and to the American public. I believe that the record speaks for itself. The Special Counsel completed his investigation as he saw fit. As I informed Congress on March 22, 2019, at no point did I, or anyone at the Department of Justice, overrule the Special Counsel on any proposed action. In addition, immediately upon receiving his confidential report to me, we began working with the Special Counsel to prepare it for public release and, on April 18, 2019, I released a public version subject only to limited redactions that were necessary to comply with the law and to protect important governmental interests. Preparation for Public Release As I explained in my letter of April 18, 2019, the redactions in the public report fall into four categories: (1) grand-jury information, the disclosure of which is prohibited by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e); (2) investigative techniques, which reflect material identified by the intelligence and law enforcement communities as potentially compromising sensitive sources, methods, or techniques, as well as information that could harm ongoing intelligence or law enforcement activities; (3) information that, if released, could harm ongoing law enforcement matters, including charged cases where court rules and orders bar public disclosure by the parties of case information; and (4) information that would unduly infringe upon the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties, which includes deliberation about decisions not to recommend prosecution of such parties. I have also made available to a bipartisan group of leaders in Congress, including Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein, a minimally redacted version that includes everything other than the grand-jury material, which by law cannot be disclosed. We made every effort to ensure that the redactions were as limited as possible. According to one analysis, just eight percent of the public report was redacted. And my understanding is that less than two percent has been withheld in the minimally redacted version made available to Congressional leaders. While the Deputy Attorney General and I selected the categories of redactions, the redactions themselves were made by Department of Justice attorneys working closely with attorneys from the Special Counsel\u2019s Office. These lawyers consulted with the prosecutors handling ongoing matters and with members of the intelligence community who reviewed selected portions of the report to advise on redactions. The Deputy Attorney General and I did not overrule any of the redaction decisions, nor did we request that any additional material be redacted. We also permitted the Office of the White House Counsel and the President\u2019s personal counsel to review the redacted report prior to its release, but neither played any role in the redaction process. Review by the Office of White House Counsel allowed them to advise the President on executive privilege, consistent with long-standing Executive Branch practice. As I have explained, the President made the determination not to withhold any information based on executive privilege. Review by the President\u2019s personal counsel was a matter of fairness in light of my decision to make public what would otherwise have been a confidential report, and it was consistent with the practice followed for years under the now-expired Ethics in Government Act. Bottom-Line Conclusions After the Special Counsel submitted the confidential report on March 22, I determined that it was in the public interest for the Department to announce the investigation\u2019s bottom-line conclusions\u2014that is, the determination whether a provable crime has been committed or not. I did so in my March 24 letter. I did not believe that it was in the public interest to release additional portions of the report in piecemeal fashion, leading to public debate over incomplete information. My main focus was the prompt release of a public version of the report so that Congress and the American people could read it for themselves and draw their own conclusions. The Department\u2019s principal responsibility in conducting this investigation was to determine whether the conduct reviewed constituted a crime that the Department could prove beyond a reasonable doubt. As Attorney General, I serve as the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States, and it is my responsibility to ensure that the Department carries out its law enforcement functions appropriately. The Special Counsel\u2019s investigation was no exception. The Special Counsel was, after all, a federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice charged with making prosecution or declination decisions. The role of the federal prosecutor and the purpose of a criminal investigation are well defined. Federal prosecutors work with grand juries to collect evidence to determine whether a crime has been committed. Once a prosecutor has exhausted his investigation into the facts of a case, he or she faces a binary choice: either to commence or to decline prosecution. To commence prosecution, the prosecutor must apply the principles of federal prosecution and conclude both that the conduct at issue constitutes a federal offense and that the admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a guilty verdict by an unbiased trier of fact. These principles govern the conduct of all prosecutions by the Department and are codified in the Justice Manual. The appointment of a Special Counsel and the investigation of the conduct of the President of the United States do not change these rules. To the contrary, they make it all the more important for the Department to follow them. The appointment of a Special Counsel calls for particular care since it poses the risk of what Attorney General Robert Jackson called \u201cthe most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted.\u201d By definition, a Special Counsel is charged with investigating particular potential crimes, not all potential crimes wherever they may be found. Including a democratically elected politician as a subject in a criminal investigation likewise calls for special care. As Attorney General Jackson admonished his United States Attorneys, politically sensitive cases demand that federal prosecutors be \u201cdispassionate and courageous\u201d in order to \u201cprotect the spirit as well as the letter of our civil liberties.\u201d The core civil liberty that underpins our American criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence. Every person enjoys this presumption long before the commencement of any investigation or official proceeding. A federal prosecutor\u2019s task is to decide whether the admissible evidence is sufficient to overcome that presumption and establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If so, he seeks an indictment; if not, he does not. The Special Counsel\u2019s report demonstrates that there are many subsidiary considerations informing that prosecutorial judgment\u2014including whether particular legal theories would extend to the facts of the case and whether the evidence is sufficient to prove one or another element of a crime. But at the end of the day, the federal prosecutor must decide yes or no. That is what I sought to address in my March 24 letter. Russian Interference The Special Counsel inherited an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, and whether any individuals affiliated with President Trump\u2019s campaign colluded in those efforts. In Volume I of the report, the Special Counsel found that several provable crimes were committed by Russian nationals related to two distinct schemes. First, the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters through disinformation and social media operations. Second, the report details efforts by Russian military officials associated with the GRU to hack into computers and steal documents and emails from individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton for the purpose of eventually publicizing those emails. Following a thorough investigation, the Special Counsel brought charges against several Russian nationals and entities in connection with each scheme. The Special Counsel also looked at whether any member or affiliate of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump participated in these crimes. With respect to the disinformation scheme, the Special Counsel found no evidence that any Americans\u2014including anyone associated with the Trump campaign\u2014conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA. Likewise, with respect to hacking, the Special Counsel found no evidence that anyone associated with the Trump campaign, nor any other American, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations. Moreover, the Special Counsel did not find that any Americans committed a crime in connection with the dissemination of the hacked materials in part because a defendant could not be charged for dissemination without proof of his involvement in the underlying hacking conspiracy. Finally, the Special Counsel investigated a number of \u201clinks\u201d or \u201ccontacts\u201d between Trump Campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign. The Special Counsel did not find any conspiracy with the Russian government to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign. Thus, as to the original question of conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, the Special Counsel did not find that any crimes were committed by the campaign or its affiliates. Obstruction of Justice In Volume II of the report, the Special Counsel considered whether certain actions of the President could amount to obstruction of justice. The Special Counsel decided not to reach a conclusion, however, about whether the President committed an obstruction offense. Instead, the report recounts ten episodes and discusses potential legal theories for connecting the President\u2019s actions to the elements of an obstruction offense. After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that, under the principles of federal prosecution, the evidence developed by the Special Counsel would not be sufficient to charge the President with an obstruction-of-justice offense. The Deputy Attorney General and I knew that we had to make this assessment because, as I previously explained, the prosecutorial judgment whether a crime has been established is an integral part of the Department\u2019s criminal process. The Special Counsel regulations provide for the report to remain confidential. Given the extraordinary public interest in this investigation, however, I determined that it was necessary to make as much of it public as I could and committed the Department to being as transparent as possible. But it would not have been appropriate for me simply to release Volume II of the report without making a prosecutorial judgment. The Deputy Attorney General and I therefore conducted a careful review of the report, looking at the facts found and the legal theories set forth by the Special Counsel. Although we disagreed with some of the Special Counsel\u2019s legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we accepted the Special Counsel\u2019s legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion. We concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. * * * The responsibility of the Department of Justice, when it comes to law enforcement, is to determine whether crimes have been committed and to prosecute those crimes under the principles of federal prosecution. With the completion of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and the resulting prosecutorial decisions, the Department\u2019s work on this matter is at its end aside from completing the cases that have been referred to other offices. From here on, the exercise of responding and reacting to the report is a matter for the American people and the political process. As I am sure you agree, it is vitally important for the Department of Justice to stand apart from the political process and not to become an adjunct of it.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s use of executive privilege to block former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a congressional subpoena \u201cis always an option,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday. \u201cExecutive privilege is always an option, it\u2019s always on the table. But Don McGahn has already talked under oath for 30 hours. And this is just presidential harassment,\u201d Conway told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d adding that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to use the power. Conway\u2019s comments come nearly a week after the House Judiciary Committee served McGahn with a subpoena as part of its investigation into obstruction of justice, a move to bring in a key player with direct knowledge about Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the Russia probe, which were outlined in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Congress returns this week: Here's where the Democratic investigations stand Shortly after the subpoena was issued, CNN learned that the White House may seek to prevent McGahn from complying with it. A source familiar with the idea said the President could assert executive privilege over specific aspects if McGahn testifies, but noted that discussions are not that far along yet and added that other measures are still being considered. McGahn\u2019s testimony is still being negotiated with the committee, and he could be a key test case for the committee\u2019s broader investigation into possible corruption, abuse of power and obstruction of justice, in which the panel is likely to seek interviews with numerous White House officials. The subpoena requests documents by May 7 and McGahn\u2019s testimony by May 21. Conway brushed off the panel\u2019s efforts, telling Tapper that \u201cthose who are subpoenaing different individuals are trying to push aside the fact that we have an entire Mueller investigation that lasted 22 months, cost about $30 million \u2013 that is the expansive, somewhat expensive, definitive and conclusive investigation.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb, Kaitlan Collins, Kara Scannell, Manu Raju and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Robert Mueller has left America with a question its political leaders would prefer to avoid. What will citizens do about a presidency that may not be criminal, but is incessantly contemptuous of ethical and legal constraints, and may be the knowing product of an attack on the nation\u2019s democracy by a hostile foreign power? The special counsel\u2019s redacted final report released Thursday is unlikely to drive Donald Trump from office in disgrace \u2013 and that may be the only thing the President really cares about. \u201cI\u2019m having a good day!\u201d Trump said, choosing to ignore an avalanche of devastating news coverage. Republican politicians have proven willing to swallow whatever ills are in the report and continue to support Trump, leaving impeachment as a partisan endeavor \u2013 and one top Democrats seem likely to avoid. That means it\u2019s up to 2020 voters to render a verdict on Trump\u2019s fitness for office. The report is indisputably bad for Trump all the same, and its depth and texture leaves his mantra of \u201cno collusion, no obstruction\u201d looking inadequate to face the enormity of the case. Read and search the full Mueller report Mueller\u2019s depiction is of a President unfit for any traditional concept of his office \u2013 covering up, lying, dangling pardons, trampling constitutional norms and viewing his campaign as an \u201cinfomercial\u201d for his businesses casts an indelible stain on his administration. And the report\u2019s staggering account of Russia\u2019s comprehensive social media and hacking effort to amplify political discord in America cannot help but raise new questions about the legitimacy of the 2016 election the President so cherishes. Mueller also leaves Democrats in a difficult spot, now faced with an agonizing political choice on how to respond to a report that appears to demand further action in support of constitutional principles \u2013 even if they, and most voters, have little stomach for House impeachment hearings and would prefer to concentrate on an electoral remedy to Trump\u2019s transgressions. Realistically, Democrats may be unwilling to pay the price of an impeachment investigation in the knowledge that few GOP senators \u2013 cowed by the President\u2019s fervent support from his base \u2013 will vote to convict. \u201cBased on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,\u201d Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second highest-ranking House Democrat, told CNN. \u201cVery frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment.\u201d Democrats are pledging to press on with their multiple investigations into Trump\u2019s campaign, transition, presidency and business record \u2013 and the President faces significant challenges from criminal cases in New York and elsewhere. But despite the shockwaves set off by the special counsel\u2019s report, the political deadlock in Washington \u2013 that enshrines a nation split down the middle on Trump \u2013 likely means that only a new election can make sense of a presidential race stained by Russian malfeasance and a presidency that seems to know no limits. Mueller\u2019s top lines \u2013 that he did not find a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s election meddling but failed to clear Trump of obstruction of justice \u2013 do appear to spare Trump from existential criminal and political threats. There is not one, single, outrageous moment that might crystallize his transgressions and make impeachment unavoidable \u2013 a process that would be sure to become a national nightmare \u2013 from any political perspective. Mueller report unable to conclude 'no criminal conduct occurred' on obstruction But Mueller\u2019s conclusions only hint at the stunning look Mueller provides inside the 2016 presidential campaign and the fraught conditions of the West Wing of the White House. The former FBI director effectively says in his 400-page report that though he cannot indict the President owing to Justice Department guidelines, there may be a case for Congress to adjudicate and effectively lays out an 11-point explanation for how the President may have obstructed justice. He even argues that his investigation was important to preserve evidence for any future prosecution once Trump has left office.n And Mueller offers a possible reason for the cover up, apparently designed to get around Attorney General William Barr\u2019s conclusion that there was no obstruction of justice since there was no underlying crime. \u201cThe evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns.\u201d Mueller paints a picture of a campaign team that, while not openly conspiring with Russians, fully expected to benefit from an operation by Moscow\u2019s intelligence agencies. He writes about how Russian social media templates were eagerly tweeted by senior campaign staff, unaware they were effectively tools in an assault on American democracy. Once Trump becomes President the picture becomes even darker. Mueller\u2019s character sketch is of a President in denial about Russian meddling, obsessed with any slurs on his election triumph and demanding subordinates lie to the public to keep damaging stories out of the press and even demanding the special counsel be fired. As Mueller tells it, Trump may only have been saved from the prospect of impeachment because his aides \u2013 such as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and ex-White House Counsel Don McGahn, who Trump was ironically berating for failing to shield him \u2013 refused to carry out his wildest, and possibly illegal demands. \u201cYou were supposed to protect me,\u201d Trump tells Sessions in one encounter after the appointment of Mueller, which Trump said left him \u201cfu**ed. \u201c The febrile atmosphere inside the White House is also revealed when Trump calls McGahn to demand he fire Mueller. The ex-White House counsel told Mueller\u2019s team that he felt trapped, and drove himself to the White House to pack his bags because he felt the need to resign to avoid being forced to perpetrate a Watergate-style \u201cSaturday Night Massacre.\u201d Mueller\u2019s report also shatters the credibility of some Trump aides. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders for instance admitted to Mueller that her claim in an interview that rank-and-file FBI agents lost confidence in their Director James Comey before he was fired was \u201cnot founded on anything.\u201d The ideological divides of the Trump era are so entrenched that the report may have little immediate political effect. Republicans and Trump\u2019s base will pick up the case made by Attorney General William Barr in an extraordinary press conference before the report was released in which he suggested may Trump may have been prompted to obstruct justice because he was frustrated by press reports about Russia. Barr\u2019s conduct also raises concerns. With his summary of the report last month delivered to Congress, and his on-camera appearance Thursday, the attorney general appears to have been determined to offer political cover to the President. His interpretation of the law regarding presidential obstruction also appears to differ significantly from Mueller\u2019s that is laid out in an exhaustive legal argument in the report. The discrepancy lends credence to claims that Barr, who wrote an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department faulting Mueller\u2019s approach on obstruction, was doing exactly the job he was picked to do when Trump chose him as his new attorney general. The departure of Sessions and the assent of Barr may add up to a shrewd mastery of the Washington power game on the part of the President. But it also validates the picture of unrestrained constitutional meddling that Mueller depicts in his report. Mueller does not answer every lingering question of his two-year investigation but his report is exhaustive and complex. But he refutes the caricature of a \u201choax\u201d investigation led by \u201cdirty cops\u201d and partisan Democrats that Trump has tried to perpetuate for the last two years. In fact, Mueller goes out of his way to be fair to the President, his family and his campaign. He, for instance, explains how the mountains of evidence of campaign contacts with Russians is not sufficient to charge crimes under conspiracy, foreign agent, or campaign finance laws. He considered a case against Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., but ultimately decided not to charge him because of the difficulty in establishing the value of information offered in a notorious Trump Tower meeting with a Russian delegation promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Mueller says that his team did not set out to build a definitive case that Trump obstructed justice since Trump as President could not be criminally charged and therefore would not have the right to defend himself at trial. The report also refutes Trump\u2019s claim that the whole investigation was an elaborate \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d From the meetings of Trump associates with Russians in Europe and the United States to the contacts between Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks, which released Clinton emails hacked by Russian intelligence, there appears ample reasons why alarms were triggered in the FBI. One of the big questions all along was why did so many of Trump\u2019s associates lie about their contacts with the Russians? Mueller does not provide an answer though his findings show that people like foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn may have escaped without criminal records had they only told the truth about their contacts with Russian officials and emissaries. The special counsel does appear to vindicate Comey, by finding there is \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence to back up the former FBI director\u2019s contemporaneous accounts of meetings with Trump in which the President asked him to go easy on Flynn and which he testified appeared to be an attempt to forge a relationship of patronage. Initial reactions of Trump\u2019s friends and foes were instructive when it comes to what may happen next in the new political landscape shaped by the report. Typically, the Trump camp is declaring total and overwhelming victory and threatening vengeance, even in circumstances that raise devastating questions about the President\u2019s behavior. \u201cNow the tables have turned, and it\u2019s time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation into President Trump, motivated by political retribution and based on no evidence whatsoever,\u201d said Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale. The President appeared to interpret Mueller\u2019s failure to accuse him of crimes as a vindication for the unchained, hard driving approach and attitude to expansive executive power that has made his presidency so controversial. \u201cI had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted. I could have fired everyone, including Mueller, if I wanted. I chose not to. I had the RIGHT to use Executive Privilege. I didn\u2019t!\u201d Trump tweeted.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s one of the most consequential days in recent memory in Washington, as the results of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s nearly-two-year-long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election are released to the public. We\u2019re covering it all here. And I\u2019m watching and reading it all \u2013 from Attorney General William Barr\u2019s press conference on Thursday morning through the entire 300-plus-page Mueller report itself. Below you\u2019ll find a running list of my takeaways from this most amazing day in the nation\u2019s capital. (The takeaways are listed in chronological order \u2013 from the start of the day to the end.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! It wasn\u2019t \u2013 and isn\u2019t \u2013 clear to me why Barr held a press conference to discuss the report before anyone other than his team, the White House Counsel\u2019s office and President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyers had read it. The obvious reason \u2013 and it became more and more obvious as Barr spoke \u2013 was that he wanted to frame the day in a decidedly pro-Trump light. At times, Barr sounded as though he was quoting some of the President\u2019s pushback on the Mueller investigation almost verbatim. One example: \u201cSo that is the bottom line. After nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.\u201d Time and again, Barr made clear that Trump and his White House bent over backward to work with the special counsel\u2019s office (even as the President was savaging Mueller and his team regularly on Twitter). Barr noted that while he had allowed the White House Counsel\u2019s office and Trump\u2019s personal lawyers to read the report, they had not been offered the chance to redact any information \u2013 nor had they requested to do so. And on the question of executive privilege, Barr had this to say: \u201cBecause the White House voluntarily cooperated with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, significant portions of the report contain material over which the President could have asserted privilege. And he would have been well within his rights to do so.\u201d Trump chose not to do so, Barr noted. There\u2019s no question that Barr did exactly what Trump would have wanted in this press conference. He emphasized the lack of proof of collusion. He raised red flags about how Mueller defined episodes of obstruction (more on that below). He painted Trump as a willing partner with the special counsel, with nothing at all to hide. It was a script Trump could not have written better himself. Barr said that Mueller had reported on 10 instances of potential obstruction of the investigation by Trump. But he immediately sought to downplay those events by noting that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who stood by his side at the press conference with the look of a man about to face his executioner, disagreed with how Mueller interpreted some of these instances of obstruction. \u201cAlthough the Deputy Attorney General and I disagreed with some of the Special Counsel\u2019s legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision,\u201d Barr said. He then went on to offer an explanation for Trump\u2019s conduct \u2013 casting him as someone facing an \u201cunprecedented situation\u201d in regard to the investigation that greeted him almost as soon as he entered the White House. \u201cAs the special counsel\u2019s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,\u201d Barr said. What\u2019s happening here is clear: 1) Barr has read the report and likely knows the obstruction stuff in relation to the President isn\u2019t going to look good to the public and 2) Barr is offering up an explanation \u2013 likely to be utilized by the President, his allies and the conservative media for why Trump acted the way he did vis a vis the Mueller probe. He was being targeted in unprecedented ways! There was \u201crelentless speculation in the news media about the President\u2019s personal culpability!\u201d He was, to not coin a phrase, the subject of a witch hunt! For anyone who thought the President might sit today out on social media, leaving the talking to his lawyers, Trump proved you wrong almost as soon as he opened his eyes this morning. \u201cThe Greatest Political Hoax of all time! Crimes were committed by Crooked, Dirty Cops and DNC/The Democrats,\u201d he tweeted just after 7 a.m. on the East Coast. Trump followed that tweet up with this two-word gem: \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT.\u201d (If you wonder whether the CAPS are mine or his, well, you have been living on another planet for the last two years.) Trump then went on a retweeting binge of the conservative group Judicial Watch before posting a smash-cut video of him saying \u201cno collusion\u201d and then a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d meme with the words \u201cGame Over\u201d featured prominently. At a Wounded Warrior event shortly after the release of the report, Trump said, \u201cThis should never happen to another president again, this hoax. It should never happen to another president again.\u201d Trump is Trump. And who that person is amounts to a mix of a conservative talk radio show host, an online troll, a bully \u2013 online and offline \u2013 and the most unconventional politician anyone has ever seen. He got elected to the White House by saying and doing things no other politician \u2013 and very few other people \u2013 would say or do. And he ain\u2019t stopping now \u2013 Mueller report be damned. In the executive summary of the collusion portion of the Mueller report, the special counsel\u2019s office gets right to the heart of the matter on the collusion question: \u201cAlthough the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d What Mueller found then is that although one party (the Russians) sought to influence the election for Trump because they thought he would be better for their interests and the other party (the Trump campaign) believed that any and all dirt the Russians gave them on Hillary Clinton would increase Trump\u2019s chances of winning, it didn\u2019t amount to conspiracy or coordination (\u201ccollusion\u201d is not a legal term) because the two sides were operating independently. While Trump and his side were happy to get negative information about Clinton, they didn\u2019t expressly ask the Russians in advance to go find some. And while the Russians wanted Trump to win for their own selfish purposes, they didn\u2019t communicate that desire to the candidate or his inner circle with the proffer of damaging information. The key, at least for Mueller, is that while all of this was going on, there was never an express agreement between the two sides that the Russian government would work to influence the election to help Trump and that Trump would welcome such an effort. The second half of the Mueller report deals with the question of obstruction. And while Mueller made no specific recommendation on whether Trump obstructed justice (MUCH more on that below), he did uncover a series of previously unknown events in which the President quite clearly sought to manipulate the direction of the investigation. Among them: * Trump not only told White House counsel Donald McGahn to remove Mueller as special counsel in June 2017 due to alleged conflicts of interest the former FBI director had, but when The New York Times later reported he had done so, Trump called McGahn into his office, asked him to deny the reports, and when McGahn refused to do so, he \u201cchallenged\u201d the White House counsel for taking notes on their meetings and asked why he\u2019d told the special counsel about Trump\u2019s efforts to have Mueller removed. * Trump, on two separate occasions, had meetings with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in which he asked Lewandowski to tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he had to tell the special counsel\u2019s office to limit its investigatory focus to future election interference. Lewandowski felt uncomfortable doing so unless in person, and he never wound up passing that request on to Sessions. * The President personally directed a line be deleted in Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s statement to The New York Times regarding the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians. That line acknowledged that the meeting was held, at least in part, because the Trump campaign believed the Russians might have dirt on Clinton. The edited statement said the meeting was solely a discussion about US adoption policies. Trump initially said he simply looked over his son\u2019s statement \u2013 before changing his story. * When former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 and began working with the special counsel, Trump met with Sessions to urge him to un-recuse himself and said doing so would make the attorney general a \u201chero.\u201d * At around the same time, Trump\u2019s personal attorney reached out to Flynn\u2019s attorneys to ensure that Flynn knew Trump has always had \u201cwarm feelings\u2019 toward the former adviser and that those feelings remained. The attorney for Trump also requested that Flynn let Trump know if he was aware of any \u201cinformation that implicates the President.\u201d Flynn\u2019s lawyers refused that offer, noting that they no longer were working under a joint defense agreement. Trump\u2019s lawyers then responded to Flynn\u2019s attorneys that they would report back to Trump that Flynn\u2019s actions reflected \u201chostility\u201d toward the President. * Following the raid of Michael Cohen\u2019s home, hotel and office, the President personally and privately passed on messages of support to Cohen even as he was publicly tweeting that Cohen would never \u201cflip.\u201d (Cohen did flip, eventually cooperating with both the special counsel\u2019s office and the Southern District of New York). It is absolutely true that Barr, along with Rosenstein, decided not to bring charges of obstruction against Trump. What is, well, much less true, is Trump\u2019s assertion that the Mueller report totally exonerates him on that front. It expressly does not. \u201c(I)f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,\u201d reads the Mueller report. \u201cBased on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. \u2026 Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d The answer to that question is that it\u2019s complicated. Mueller cites a number of factors for why he ultimately didn\u2019t recommend such a charge. They include: * There was no underlying crime for which Trump was obstructing the investigation. While Mueller makes clear that there need not be an underlying crime for obstruction to occur, he acknowledges that the lack of proof of collusion makes the obstruction case a harder sell. * Many of the President\u2019s underlings \u2013 like, say Lewandowski and McGahn \u2013 didn\u2019t actually carry out their boss\u2019s orders. And so, there was no obstruction even if Trump had intended to do so. * So much of what Trump did was in public that Mueller found it hard to conclude that the President was executing some sort of broad-scale attempt to obstruct justice. * Many of the more high-profile moves by Trump \u2013 most notably firing FBI Director James Comey \u2013 were within his presidential powers. Those reasons won\u2019t satisfy Democrats, who will look at the laundry list of ways Mueller documents Trump seeking to meddle in the investigation and see clear proof of obstruction. But the bottom line is this: Mueller made no recommendation to Barr on obstruction \u2013 nor did he say he expected Barr to offer a judgment on whether or not Trump should be charged. Why did Barr \u2013 with Rosenstein \u2013 decide that Trump should be cleared of any wrongdoing in regard to obstruction? \u201cThat is our responsibility,\u201d Barr said at his press conference Thursday morning. For all his \u2013 and his aides\u2019 \u2013 attempts to argue that everything was \u201cvery legal and very cool,\u201d the President was boiling behind closed doors. According to the Mueller report: \u201c(W)hen Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, \u2018Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I\u2019m fucked.\u2019 The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, \u2018How could you let this happen, Jeff?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s important to note here that Trump believed that history suggested that the formation of an independent or special counsel was the beginning of the end of getting anything done in a presidency. \u201cIt takes years and years and I won\u2019t be able to do anything,\u201d Trump is quoted as telling a handful of top aides, including Sessions. \u201cThis is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to the President, denied the report\u2019s account on Thursday afternoon, telling reporters: \u201cI was very surprised to see that, because that was not the reaction of the President that day. I was there.\u201d There were some who believed that when Mueller\u2019s report went public its findings would effectively doom Trump\u2019s presidency. That isn\u2019t going to happen and, in truth, even if the report had returned charges against, say, Donald Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner, I\u2019m not sure Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters would be persuaded. But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead we got two top-line conclusions: 1) Neither Trump nor anyone in his campaign conspired with the Russian government in the 2016 election and 2) Trump will not be charged by the DOJ with obstructing the investigation. Both of those conclusions are very good news for Trump. Period. Yes, the details \u2013 as I documented above \u2013 of Trump\u2019s conduct regarding the special counsel investigation are unsavory. And yes, if you went into reading the Mueller report convinced that Trump obstructed justice, you aren\u2019t going to see anything in the report that will do anything other than convince you even more that he did so. Remember this, however: The number of non-reporters who will read even half of the 300+ report is very, very small. Some people will skim. Others might read portions they are interested in. Most will read none of the actual report \u2013 choosing instead to follow news coverage and/or partisan reactions to it. All of which will reinforce the divided nature of our current politics. The Mueller report neither exonerates Trump nor implicates him. And that sort of uncertainty gets eaten alive in our politics, ripped to pieces by partisans who tear off chunks that support their extant beliefs. While Mueller didn\u2019t recommend Trump be charged with obstruction (and Barr expressly ruled it out) there\u2019s a line in Mueller\u2019s report that suggests the special counsel was making clear one way forward on all of this. Here it is: \u201cThe conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President\u2019s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.\u201d What Mueller and his team seem to be doing there is laying a predicate for future congressional action on the instances he documents in which Trump may have acted in an obstructive manner. What Mueller is saying is that by his reading of the Constitution, Congress would be within its rights to take the conclusions from his investigation and pursue obstruction charges \u2013 presumably via impeachment proceedings \u2013 against Trump. Whether the Democratic-led House takes the path very much remains to be seen. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) has been skeptical about impeachment proceedings unless and until there was a bipartisan desire for them in the country. It\u2019s hard to imagine that day coming anytime soon. And even if Democrats do try to pursue the obstruction angle, it seems very unlikely that the Republican-controlled Senate would go along with any impeachment effort.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General William Barr delivered remarks Thursday on the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s redacted report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Here is a copy of the full remarks as prepared for delivery: Good Morning.  Thank you all for being here today. On March 22, 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation of matters related to Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and submitted his confidential report to me pursuant to Department of Justice regulations. As I said during my Senate confirmation hearing and since, I am committed to ensuring the greatest possible degree of transparency concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, consistent with the law. At 11:00 this morning, I will transmit copies of a public version of the Special Counsel\u2019s report to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.  The Department of Justice will also make the report available to the American public by posting it on the Department\u2019s website after it has been delivered to Congress. I would like to offer a few comments today on the report. But before I do that, I want to thank Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for joining me here today and for his assistance and counsel throughout this process.  Rod has served the Department of Justice for many years with dedication and distinction, and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to work with him since my confirmation.  He had well-deserved plans to step back from public service that I interrupted by asking him to help in my transition.  Rod has been an invaluable partner, and I am grateful that he was willing to help me and has been able to see the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation to its conclusion.  Thank you, Rod. I would also like to thank Special Counsel Mueller for his service and the thoroughness of his investigation, particularly his work exposing the nature of Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in our electoral process. As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation was to determine whether members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, or any individuals associated with that campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.  Volume I of the Special Counsel\u2019s report describes the results of that investigation.  As you will see, the Special Counsel\u2019s report states that his \u201cinvestigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d I am sure that all Americans share my concerns about the efforts of the Russian government to interfere in our presidential election.  As the Special Counsel\u2019s report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere in our election.  But thanks to the Special Counsel\u2019s thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign \u2013 or the knowing assistance of any other Americans for that matter.  That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed. The Special Counsel\u2019s report outlines two main efforts by the Russian government to influence the 2016 election: First, the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters through disinformation and social media operations.  Following a thorough investigation of this disinformation campaign, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian nationals and entities for their respective roles in this scheme.  Those charges remain pending, and the individual defendants remain at large. But the Special Counsel found no evidence that any Americans \u2013 including anyone associated with the Trump campaign \u2013 conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme.  Indeed, as the report states, \u201c[t]he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA\u2019s interference operation.\u201d  Put another way, the Special Counsel found no \u201ccollusion\u201d by any Americans in the IRA\u2019s illegal activity. Second, the report details efforts by Russian military officials associated with the GRU to hack into computers and steal documents and emails from individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton for the purpose of eventually publicizing those emails.  Obtaining such unauthorized access into computers is a federal crime.  Following a thorough investigation of these hacking operations, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian military officers for their respective roles in these illegal hacking activities.  Those charges are still pending and the defendants remain at large. But again, the Special Counsel\u2019s report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations.  In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Russian government\u2019s hacking. The Special Counsel\u2019s investigation also examined Russian efforts to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet.  The Special Counsel found that, after the GRU disseminated some of the stolen materials through its own controlled entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the GRU transferred some of the stolen materials to Wikileaks for publication.  Wikileaks then made a series of document dumps.  The Special Counsel also investigated whether any member or affiliate of the Trump campaign encouraged or otherwise played a role in these dissemination efforts.  Under applicable law, publication of these types of materials would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in the underlying hacking conspiracy.  Here too, the Special Counsel\u2019s report did not find that any person associated with the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials. Finally, the Special Counsel investigated a number of \u201clinks\u201d or \u201ccontacts\u201d between Trump Campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign.  After reviewing those contacts, the Special Counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign. So that is the bottom line.  After nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes. After finding no underlying collusion with Russia, the Special Counsel\u2019s report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the President could amount to obstruction of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.  As I addressed in my March 24th letter, the Special Counsel did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment regarding this allegation.  Instead, the report recounts ten episodes involving the President and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense. After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Although the Deputy Attorney General and I disagreed with some of the Special Counsel\u2019s legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision.  Instead, we accepted the Special Counsel\u2019s legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion. In assessing the President\u2019s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context.  President Trump faced an unprecedented situation.  As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates.  At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President\u2019s personal culpability.  Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.  And as the Special Counsel\u2019s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks.  Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims.  And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation. Now, before I take questions, I want to address a few aspects of the process for producing the public report that I am releasing today.  As I said several times, the report contains limited redactions relating to four categories of information.  To ensure as much transparency as possible, these redactions have been clearly labelled and color-coded so that readers can tell which redactions correspond to which categories. As you will see, most of the redactions were compelled by the need to prevent harm to ongoing matters and to comply with court orders prohibiting the public disclosure of information bearing upon ongoing investigations and criminal cases, such as the IRA case and the Roger Stone case. These redactions were applied by Department of Justice attorneys working closely together with attorneys from the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, as well as with the intelligence community, and prosecutors who are handling ongoing cases.  The redactions are their work product. Consistent with long-standing Executive Branch practice, the decision whether to assert Executive privilege over any portion of the report rested with the President of the United States.  Because the White House voluntarily cooperated with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, significant portions of the report contain material over which the President could have asserted privilege.  And he would have been well within his rights to do so.  Following my March 29th letter, the Office of the White House Counsel requested the opportunity to review the redacted version of the report in order to advise the President on the potential invocation of privilege, which is consistent with long-standing practice.  Following that review, the President confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the Special Counsel\u2019s report.  Accordingly, the public report I am releasing today contains redactions only for the four categories that I previously outlined, and no material has been redacted based on executive privilege. In addition, earlier this week, the President\u2019s personal counsel requested and were given the opportunity to read a final version of the redacted report before it was publicly released.  That request was consistent with the practice followed under the Ethics in Government Act, which permitted individuals named in a report prepared by an Independent Counsel the opportunity to read the report before publication.  The President\u2019s personal lawyers were not permitted to make, and did not request, any redactions. In addition to making the redacted report public, we are also committed to working with Congress to accommodate their legitimate oversight interests with respect to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.  We have been consulting with Chairman Graham and Chairman Nadler throughout this process, and we will continue to do so. Given the limited nature of the redactions, I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.  Nevertheless, in an effort to accommodate congressional requests, we will make available to a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees a version of the report with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information.  Thus, these members of Congress will be able to see all of the redacted material for themselves \u2013 with the limited exception of that which, by law, cannot be shared. I believe that this accommodation, together with my upcoming testimony before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, will satisfy any need Congress has for information regarding the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. Once again, I would like to thank you all for being here today.  I now have a few minutes for questions.",

            "article_content": "For the first time since the end of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Attorney General William Barr faced questions on Capitol Hill regarding his handling of Mueller\u2019s findings, when he plans to release the report and how he will handle the issue of redacted information. Barr was loath to provide many details other than to say that the Justice Department planned to release the redacted report in the next week. But in not answering some of the more pointed questions asked by House Democrats, Barr did reveal some important information that moves our understanding of not only the Mueller report but of his handling of it. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Below, the key takeaways from Barr\u2019s testimony. Barr repeatedly refused to answer a direct question as to whether the White House has seen \u2013 or will see \u2013 the full Mueller report prior to its release. That is a change from Barr\u2019s past statement just 11 days ago when he said in a letter sent to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. \u201cAlthough the President would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report,\u201d Barr wrote in that letter, \u201che has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.\u201d So as of March 29, there were \u201cno plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.\u201d But as of today, Barr wouldn\u2019t answer whether the White House has or would see the report prior to its release. Which suggests, at least to me, that the White House either has or could see the report before its release. Barr later acknowledged that he advised the White House counsel before his letter went out on March 24. He said that the letter may have been read to them, but they did not get a hard copy of it. \u201cI don\u2019t intend at this stage to send the full unredacted report to the committee,\u201d Barr said in response to questions from Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Graves about whether leaking the full, unredacted report by a member of Congress would be a crime. Barr also said, in response to questions by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), that the redacted version of the Mueller report that Congress would see would be the same one that the public sees. The one possible exception he left open: If the chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees wanted to see the full report, Barr seems to suggest he would be willing to talk to them about that. Lowey asked Barr a very simple question: Who is right \u2013 the President, who says he was totally exonerated on the question of collusion and obstruction or Mueller, who Barr directly quoted in his summary letter, saying \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him?\u201d Barr didn\u2019t answer, insisting he has said everything he planned to say about the report until it comes out. Which means that Barr didn\u2019t want to say the President is wrong \u2013 which he is, at least on the question of obstruction \u2013 in a public setting. One of the biggest focuses of House Democrats\u2019 on the committee was how Barr took a 300+-page report produced over a 22-month period and condensed its findings to a four-page letter summarizing its bottom-line conclusion in less than 72 hours. Barr shed some light on the \u201chow\u201d behind that fast read. He said that he had \u201csome inkling as to some of the thinking of the special counsel\u201d due to public reporting on indictments, etc. filed by Mueller. And, Barr said, he and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with the special counsel team on March 5, where they were briefed on the basic conclusions of the report.",

In a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate judiciary committees, Barr said his department is \u201cwell along\u201d making redactions, with the assistance of the special counsel, and \u201cthere are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.\u201d The exact length of the report has been shrouded in secrecy, but Barr said Friday the report is \u201cnearly 400 pages long,\u201d not including appendices and tables, and \u201csets forth the Special Counsel\u2019s findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions.\u201d Barr also offered to testify shortly after the report is released, suggesting May 1 for the Senate committee and May 2 for the House committee. On Sunday, Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller\u2019s principal conclusions, which Barr makes clear were not meant to be an \u201cexhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation or report.\u201d In that summary, Barr said that the Russia investigation \u201cdid not establish\u201d that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government before the election, but Mueller did not draw a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice. Trump and his Republicans allies have claimed vindication following Barr\u2019s summary of the Mueller report, while Democrats have said they have to read the full report for themselves first to see what Mueller really found. They also want Barr to explain how he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided Trump\u2019s actions did not meet the standards for prosecuting an obstruction of justice case. Barr wrote Friday that he does not think it\u2019s in the public interest for him to summarize Mueller\u2019s full report, nor does he plan to release sections in \u201cpiecemeal fashion.\u201d \u201cEveryone will soon be able to read it on their own,\u201d Barr added Friday. Barr further confirmed that the Justice Department and special counsel\u2019s team are working to redact four types of information from the report: grand jury material, sensitive intelligence material, information that involves ongoing investigations, and \u201cinformation that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\u201d But the redactions Barr is working on won\u2019t satisfy Democrats. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York issued a statement Friday responding to Barr\u2019s letter by insisting that Democrats want the full Mueller report without redactions. \u201cAs I informed the Attorney General earlier this week, Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence, by April 2. That deadline still stands,\u201d Nadler said. When they spoke by phone this week, Nadler asked Barr to work with the committee to ask the courts to make grand jury information public, according to a Democratic aide who said Barr would not commit to doing so. Democrats argue there is precedent for releasing grand jury material, and the aide said they see that as the \u201cprimary obstacle\u201d to making the full Mueller report public. \u201cRather than expend valuable time and resources trying to keep certain portions of this report from Congress, he should work with us to request a court order to release any and all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 as has occurred in every similar investigation in the past,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cThere is ample precedent for the Department of Justice sharing all of the information that the Attorney General proposes to redact to the appropriate congressional committees.\u201d Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, accused Nadler in a statement Friday of setting arbitrary deadlines for Barr to release the report, and said Nadler\u2019s demand for Barr not to redact grand jury and other information amounted to calling for \u201cthe attorney general to break the law by releasing the report without redactions.\u201d The Justice Department is likely to miss the Democrats\u2019 April 2 deadline, though House Democrats have not yet said what they will do afterward. Nadler said he would take Barr\u2019s proposed May hearing date \u201cunder advisement,\u201d but also added: \u201cWe feel that it is critical for Attorney General Barr to come before Congress immediately to explain the rationale behind his letter, his rapid decision that the evidence developed was insufficient to establish an obstruction of justice offense, and his continued refusal to provide us with the full report.\u201d Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, meanwhile, said of Barr\u2019s letter: \u201cI look forward to hearing from Attorney General Barr on May 1.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.",

            "article_content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s almost 400-page findings and analysis of Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged obstruction of justice by the President may have, as members of Congress fear, heavy redactions. But the amount of information the Justice Department can rightfully hold back \u2013 especially under grand jury rules \u2013 might not be as great as it first appears, former federal prosecutors say. Not all evidence collected by a prosecutor like Mueller fit under the grand jury umbrella. Not all witness statements are made during the secret court proceedings. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the version of the report the public sees will have few redactions. Attorney General William Barr wrote to Congress last weekend about Mueller\u2019s topline findings and said his \u201cgoal and intent is to release as much of the special counsel\u2019s report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations and Departmental policies,\u201d according to the letter. On Friday, Barr gave Congress even more detail about the redaction process \u2013 laying out four reasons why portions of what Mueller wrote will be redacted. Barr also assured Congress he\u2019s not sending the Mueller report first to the White House for executive privilege considerations before it is made public. Barr said the report would be released in mid-April, \u201cif not sooner,\u201d and he offered to testify publicly to Congress about the Mueller report. Barr has control for now on what\u2019s kept private and what\u2019s not \u2013 but federal judges may decide what could be released. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted on Friday that \u201cBarr should seek court approval\u201d to release information from Mueller that might fall under grand jury secrecy. \u201cRedactions are unacceptable,\u201d Schiff wrote. At least one transparency organization has already sued to make public the Mueller report under the Freedom of Information Act. Among the reasons for redactions, Barr has emphasized to Congress the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. The grand jury rules broadly prohibit information from those proceedings leaking out \u2013 yet Democratic members of Congress have pointed out that judges can and do choose to release information from grand juries, especially when the panels have handled matters of historical importance. \u201cThere\u2019s strong authority,\u201d according to public access lawyer Ted Boutrous, for judges who supervise federal grand juries to release information. Boutrous is currently pressing for the release of details related to a grand jury subpoena sent by Mueller to an unnamed foreign-government-owned company. Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court has agreed to make some case documents public in that proceeding \u2013 though it\u2019s one part of Mueller\u2019s investigation that\u2019s still an ongoing matter, so more information identifying the company might not be released yet or identified in Mueller\u2019s report. However, Howell, who has overseen the grand jury used by Mueller, has sided with significant public access attempts in the past, including in the release of information at one time kept confidential by the courts related to grand jury proceedings of historical importance. Howell wrote a detailed opinion last year, for instance, regarding the court\u2019s disclosure of grand jury-related material in the Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton, after CNN asked to unseal the documents. The Justice Department has appealed parts of that decision, and the federal appeals court in DC continues to weigh whether judges like Howell have the ability to release grand jury information when asked. Others privy to the grand jury have power over the secret material, too \u2013 such as witnesses who testify before the grand jury exercising their First Amendment rights to speak about the proceedings. In another plus for transparency, Mueller didn\u2019t rely solely on a federal grand jury for all his evidence gathering and witness inquisitions. A tally by CNN gives a glimpse about the extensive use by Mueller of both in-person interviews and the grand jury to gather information from witnesses. More than 80 people, by CNN\u2019s count, spoke to prosecutors or the FBI outside of the grand jury, making their disclosures harder to keep secret. At least 20 witnesses are known to have testified before the grand jury between October 2017 and January of this year. The witness interviews outside the grand jury proceeding get summarized in memos written by investigators. Those documents are known as 302s and can be made public. Even in this investigation, 302s already have been made public, such as when those regarding Michael Flynn\u2019s statements to the FBI were released before a court hearing. Similarly, Hillary Clinton\u2019s FBI interview summary and those from other witnesses were made public in the investigation of her use of a private internet server while she was Secretary of State. Plus, the grand jury testimony may fall more on the side of Mueller\u2019s report regarding the Russian collusion question. There\u2019s no indication that White House officials testified to the grand jury about whether the President obstructed justice. Hundreds of other documents that comprise slivers of investigative steps \u2013 like 500 search warrants, 280 requests to look at communications data and 13 letters to foreign governments \u2013 live under seal in the court system for judges to decide when they can be made public, and how. These, in essence, would be like supplements revealing Mueller\u2019s work, showing who, when and why Mueller targeted people and their possessions for the investigation of alleged crimes. Only a handful of search warrants related to the Mueller defendants Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, and Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, have been disclosed by courts so far. Yet these already provide hundreds of pages of documentation of Mueller\u2019s work. In Mueller\u2019s case against Concord Management and Consulting, prosecutors collected terabytes of online data \u2013 including a swath of it in untranslated Russian. In the case of Roger Stone, a longtime GOP campaign adviser and Trump confidant, his attorneys got a similar stack of evidence totaling multiple terabytes that could pile \u201cas high as the Washington monument twice,\u201d Stone\u2019s attorney said in court. Previous independent counsels who\u2019ve conducted intense investigations into sitting presidents have compiled similarly massive amounts of evidence. But even the Starr investigation or the Watergate investigation wouldn\u2019t come close to Mueller\u2019s compilation. That\u2019s because those investigations took place in eras where far fewer conversations happened in writing, over email, text and apps. In Manafort\u2019s criminal proceedings, Mueller\u2019s team used their vast data collection like a sword. When Manafort ghost authored an op-ed about himself, reached out to former associates, complained about his environment in jail or made an assertion during his cooperation interviews, prosecutors had phone records, emails and even Microsoft Word tracked changes to reveal his actions. And that was all after Manafort\u2019s arrest. At his trial for financial crimes last summer \u2013 which barely related to Manafort\u2019s time on Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 the jury needed a large room so the many boxes of evidence binders would fit. \u201c50 years ago, people\u2019s records were a file drawer in their house. There is more data that is generated per human being on earth,\u201d said Seth Taube, a financial corruption lawyer and former federal prosecutor in New York. \u201cAll cases have more stuff. That\u2019s the nature of complex investigations.\u201d In all, Mueller\u2019s report stretches to almost 400 pages, not including the attachments. This isn\u2019t an extreme number, but it\u2019s a thorough one, said Terree Bowers, a former US Attorney who oversaw the Keating Five congressional scandal case. Mueller\u2019s report is \u201clong but it\u2019s not inappropriate,\u201d Bowers said this week. Mueller would use those pages to explain his cases against Russian attempts to infiltrate the election, as well as how he did not establish that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia. There\u2019s likely to be thorough discussions of law, too, including both sides of the question of whether to charge the President with obstruction of justice. (Mueller ultimately didn\u2019t decide on the obstruction question, leaving it to Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to make the call not to prosecute Trump for obstruction of justice). \u201cAs Ricky said to Lucy, \u2018You\u2019ve got some \u2018splaining to do,\u2019\u201d Bowers said about the Mueller report. Barr has told Congress that some information in the Mueller report may need to be redacted because of ongoing investigations. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how many of those remain. A federal judge in Washington prompted a Justice Department lawyer to say in court last week that a grand jury investigation started by Mueller is \u201ccontinuing robustly.\u201d The DC US Attorney\u2019s Office has stepped up to handle that case \u2013 which involves that still-unknown foreign-government-owned company. The Washington-based federal prosecutor\u2019s office has also taken over the criminal case of Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s longtime No. 2, who continues to cooperate in \u201cseveral\u201d ongoing matters, prosecutors have said. Gates has not yet been sentenced. Mueller\u2019s unit previously referred parts of its criminal investigation to even more US Attorney\u2019s Offices than just DC, including in Manhattan and in northern Virginia. Their work appears to continue as well, and at least one US Attorney\u2019s Office is still digging into Trump\u2019s inaugural committee\u2019s financial transactions. Barr also told Congress on Friday some of the report may be redacted because the intelligence community may decide it reveals \u201cpotentially compromising sources and methods.\u201d Other redactions will protect the privacy and reputations of \u201cperipheral\u201d players, Barr said. In court in recent weeks, the Justice Department has argued that pieces of Mueller\u2019s evidence must stay secret because if they are revealed, they could risk sharing national security secrets and tactics. Other court filings in cases related to Mueller have been filed entirely under seal, with next to no reason given for the secrecy. In Manafort\u2019s case, which for months Mueller used to publicly imply the direction of the broader investigation, the special counsel\u2019s team effectively went dark on their recent pursuits as they debated in court Manafort\u2019s lies during his cooperation interviews. They asserted to a judge in February that his communications with his Russian associate Konstantin Kilimnik in 2016 were at the heart of the investigation \u2013 while the redactions in Manafort\u2019s recent court record have been so pervasive it\u2019s impossible to fully understand what happened and what Mueller pursued. As recently as March 13, a Mueller prosecutor reasserted in court that the discussions about Manafort and Kilimnik while Manafort was campaign chairman should still stay secret. Yet the Mueller report is on its way. \u201cEveryone will soon be able to read it on their own,\u201d Barr wrote on Friday. CNN\u2019s Laura Jarrett and Manu Raju contributed.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday criticized Attorney General William Barr\u2019s summary of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, calling it \u201ccondescending\u201d and \u201carrogant\u201d and saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t the right thing to do.\u201d Asked if she is ready to accept Barr\u2019s summary of Mueller\u2019s conclusion that his investigation did not establish that Trump or his campaign associates conspired with Russia to win the presidential election, Pelosi didn\u2019t directly answer, saying instead that she needs to see the full Mueller report before making a judgment about what the special counsel found and reiterating her call for it to be publicly released. \u201cI have said, and I\u2019ll say again, no thank you, Mr. Attorney General, we do not need your interpretation, show us the report and we can draw our own conclusions,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi says Barr believes Trump is 'above the law' The House speaker went on to say, referring to the Barr summary, \u201cWe don\u2019t need you interpreting for us. It was condescending, it was arrogant, and it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. So, the sooner they can give us the information, the sooner we can all make a judgment about it.\u201d Barr delivered his summary of the Mueller report\u2019s findings to lawmakers over the weekend, but Democrats argue that they and the American public must have a chance to see the full special counsel report for themselves, rather than being forced to rely solely on a description of the findings from a Trump administration political appointee. It\u2019s not yet clear how much of the full Mueller report will be publicly released, but Barr has said that he intends to release as much as possible from the report. In his letter to Congress, he said he is working to determine what can be publicly released, noting that Mueller will be involved in scrubbing the report to identify grand jury material that must remain secret. Democrats are also now grappling with what steps they may take if they are not satisfied with how much of the report is ultimately released. The \u201cprimary obstacle\u201d to getting the full Mueller report is \u201cthe presence of grand jury information,\u201d according to one Democratic staffer, discussing the 10-minute phone call House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler had with Attorney General Bill Barr. Nadler offered Barr the opportunity to work together to get a court order to release the grand jury information. At a Thursday meeting where aides discussed efforts to get the Mueller report, the staffer said that Barr was \u201copen to our arguments\u201d but that\u2019s \u201ca far cry from where the chairman is right now.\u201d \u201cCongress is entitled to the grand jury material,\u201d the aide said, pointing to Watergate and other cases as precedent. The aide added that Congress does not need the Justice Department\u2019s cooperation to go to the courts and demand the grand jury information, a step they may take. Aides would not discuss when they may issue a subpoena to force the Justice Department to provide documents to Capitol Hill. They said they may announce next steps after the department officially misses the Democrats\u2019 April 2 deadline to provide the full Mueller report. They say they want to give Justice a \u201creasonable amount of time\u201d to respond first. Aides also said that while Barr said he did not plan to provide the report to the White House, \u201cit\u2019s not 100% clear to us how the attorney general plans to alleviate\u201d executive privilege questions. Barr\u2019s letter to Congress quoted Mueller\u2019s report as saying it \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d It also stated that the special counsel \u201cdid not draw a conclusion\u201d on the question of obstruction of justice. Barr wrote that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein came to the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence \u201cto establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d After Mueller, Pelosi stares down her next big fight While Pelosi did not weigh in directly on whether she is ready to accept that Mueller did not establish collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, she did suggest that the Trump campaign may have been \u201cdelinquent in their responsibilities\u201d if it failed to notify the FBI that a foreign government had dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI\u2019m deadly serious,\u201d Pelosi said, \u201cif a foreign government comes to you and says they have information on your opponent, I say to any member of Congress or person running for office, you take that right to the FBI. So for this report to say that there was no tacit cooperation, well, yeah, if they didn\u2019t bring the information to the FBI, they were delinquent in their responsibilities.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

Multiple sources told CNN earlier this month that White House lawyers expected to have an opportunity to review whatever version of Mueller\u2019s report Attorney General William Barr submits to Congress before it reaches lawmakers and the public. The attorneys wanted the White House to have an opportunity to claim executive privilege over information drawn from documents and interviews with White House officials, the sources said. But Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Wednesday he doubts the White House will see the Mueller report before it\u2019s made public. \u201cThe President told me, \u2018Just release it,\u2019\u201d the South Carolina Republican, who\u2019s been a staunch Trump ally in the Senate, said on \u201cAt This Hour.\u201d Trump said Monday it \u201cwouldn\u2019t bother\u201d him \u201cat all\u201d if Barr released the Mueller report.

Mueller\u2019s report also did not conclude that Trump committed a crime, but it \u201calso does not exonerate him\u201d of obstruction of justice, Barr wrote, quoting from the special counsel report.

Graham, who met with Barr on Tuesday night, told CNN he believes the Mueller report will likely be released \u201csometime in April, probably.\u201d The senator was unsure of how much of the Mueller report would be made public after Barr removes grand jury material and classified intelligence information. \u201cHere\u2019s what I do know: You\u2019ll get everything that doesn\u2019t compromise national security or violate the law,\u201d Graham said.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest escalation of his years-long bid to kill Obamacare has given Democrats running for president in 2020 a new opening to assail Trump \u2013 and to sell their own visions of expanded health coverage. The move by the Justice Department \u2013 telling a federal appeals court on Monday that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety \u2013 shifts the political lens back to the issue that helped bolster Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms: health care \u2013 and specifically, Republican efforts to undercut President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law. Across the board, Democratic contenders lambasted the Trump administration\u2019s move. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing politics with people\u2019s public health,\u201d  Sen. Kamala Harris from California said on MSNBC. Trump savors Mueller victory, but opens new 2020 front with Obamacare fight Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont tweeted that Trump\u2019s administration wants to \u201cthrow millions of Americans off health insurance and put lives at risk. We will fight back.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said on Twitter that for those who benefit from the Affordable Care Act, \u201cit is now the official position of the White House to take away your health coverage, with no sign of a plan to help you if they win and you lose.\u201d And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, \u201cHealth care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights.\u201d Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke vowed on Twitter to \u201cprotect the care of those whose lives depend on it.\u201d Of course, the 2020 field itself is divided on how to expand health care access, with some candidates advocating single-payer programs that would eliminate private insurance and others seeking to allow people to buy into Medicare. But by making another push to kill Obamacare, Trump and his administration have given candidates a set of health care policies around which they can coalesce \u2013 including ensuring coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, banning yearly lifetime limits and allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26. On debate stages and in town halls, the entire Democratic field is likely to be \u201cspending a good chunk of their time talking about how they want to maintain and improve health care for all Americans,\u201d said Anne Caprara, a veteran Democratic strategist who is now Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an enormous win for Democrats overall.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a conversation going on about Medicare for All and public options, but I think, frankly, people spend way more time focusing on that on Twitter than they do out in the electoral base,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is popular with Democratic voters \u2013 very popular. Nobody wants to see it repealed.\u201d Angel Padilla, policy director of the progressive political group Indivisible, said Tuesday\u2019s move would animate the Democratic base and send \u201canother signal that this is why the 2020 election matters. \u201cIt\u2019s about people\u2019s lives and it\u2019s about health care,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s latest effort to undo Obamacare will also raise the stakes of Democrats\u2019 intra-party debate over whether to pursue a single-payer health system that eliminates private insurers or set that long-term goal aside in favor of incremental steps toward universal coverage. A Sanders aide said the administration\u2019s move elevates what the Vermont senator\u2019s camp saw as one of his top issues. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it says about other candidates, but I think that it plays to his strengths as a candidate because he has a very clear message about health care and about the need to guarantee health care to every American as a right, not a privilege,\u201d the Sanders aide said. The Sanders camp\u2019s view is that a world in which health insurers have a profit-making incentive is not sustainable. \u201cAs long as you have private insurance companies as a part of that equation, you\u2019re going to have a system that is not purely interested in making people healthy and doing it in the most cost-effective way possible,\u201d the aide said. Supporters of Medicare for All argue that with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican-appointed judges in the way, anything short of a revolutionary change would have little hope of advancing. Other Democratic presidential candidates, though, have argued that a more narrow approach is all that\u2019s politically feasible. O\u2019Rourke has touted legislation by Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro that would move everyone who doesn\u2019t already have private insurance from their employers into Medicare \u2013 and allow those who do have private insurance the option of buying into Medicare instead. Sen. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota said in a recent CNN town hall that she wants to \u201cbuild on the work of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d She said Medicare for All \u201ccould be a possibility in the future,\u201d but that she is looking for \u201csomething that will work now.\u201d Whatever their differences, Democrats are unanimous in opposing Trump\u2019s pushes to undercut Obamacare, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cBut going forward and now, there is acknowledgment that there are shortcomings with the current law. Not everybody has coverage. Not everybody is eligible for help who needs it. We\u2019ve got other instability that has been initiated or aggravated by the administration\u2019s actions and by the actions of state officials that are hoping to undo or destabilize the law,\u201d Pollitz said. \u201cThis is going to be a prominent issue throughout the campaign: what direction makes sense. And also, is one direction the answer?\u201d she said. \u201cDo (the Democrats) define themselves by this one approach or could they lay out a path that perhaps would have some incremental steps along the way?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Speaking at the official launch of her presidential campaign on Sunday, US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand singled out the National Rifle Association as an example of special interests taking priority over the will of the people. \u201cRight now, special interests are displacing the voices of the people of this country. Find me a so-called unsolvable problem, and I will point you to the greed and corruption in the way,\u201d Gillibrand said, speaking in front of Trump International Hotel in New York. \u201cThe NRA stops popular, common sense gun reform, while stray bullets kill children in our communities.\u201d But during her tenure in the US House of Representatives from 2007-2009, then-Rep. Gillibrand fought vigorously in defense of gun rights, including the right to own handguns. While in the House, the New York Democrat represented a more conservative, rural district, compared to the more liberal statewide constituency she represents as a senator. Gillibrand\u2019s position, which was politically advantageous at the time in earning the endorsement of the NRA in her 2008 re-election bid, could now prove a political liability in the 2020 Democratic primary. Gillibrand has said she regrets her past positions and frames her views on guns at the time as supporting hunting rights. \u201cOn guns, I should have done more, I regret not caring about other communities,\u201d Gillibrand said at an MSNBC town hall last week. \u201cMy community didn\u2019t have the gun violence that other parts of the state had, and, in fact, the biggest issue for upstate New York was hunting rights.\u201d But Gillibrand\u2019s advocacy extended beyond hunting rights. She signed an amicus brief that argued for overturning a handgun ban in Washington, DC, and that private gun ownership was a guaranteed right unconnected to service in a militia. The amicus brief was submitted to the US Supreme Court while the court was hearing the 2008 landmark case, District of Columbia v. Heller. The court ultimately repealed the city\u2019s strict gun control laws in a sweeping victory for gun rights advocates. In addition to Gillibrand, the brief was signed by then-Vice President Dick Cheney, 55 senators (46 Republicans and nine Democrats) and 250 House members (183 Republicans and 67 Democrats). Gillibrand ultimately campaigned on her pro-gun record when running for re-election in 2008, with the NRA citing her support for the amicus brief in its endorsement of her. The plaintiff in the DC case, Dick Heller, was a special city police officer who was authorized to carry a handgun while on duty but denied a license for a handgun in his home. The court ruled in his favor and found that the city\u2019s laws banning handguns and requiring firearms in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock was unconstitutional and a violation of the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment states: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d However, there has long been fierce debate about the phrasing of the amendment and what it means by \u201ca well regulated militia.\u201d The brief signed by Gillibrand argues forcefully against the idea that it was meant to protect gun rights for militias and not private individuals, stating, \u201cThe Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms. Recognition of that right promotes the well regulated militia necessary for a free State\u2019s security.\u201d The brief also bolstered its defense by tying the idea of an individual\u2019s right to own a gun with civil rights for African Americans. It argued that the court should consider that after the Civil War, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866 to guarantee rights to recently freed former slaves. Both acts declared black persons to have the same rights as white persons, including the right to bear arms The court\u2019s ultimate ruling required that DC must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license for it, while also finding unconstitutional the city\u2019s law that rifles and shotguns be kept \u201cunloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock.\u201d At the same time the Heller case was moving through federal courts, Gillibrand co-sponsored legislation that would revoke the city\u2019s gun control laws. The proposed bill, however, went much further in restricting the city\u2019s ability to write its own gun laws than the court\u2019s ultimate decision. The core of the proposed bill, called the \u201cDistrict of Columbia Personal Protection Act,\u201d made it so that Washington, DC, would not be allowed to pass any laws restricting firearm usage and ownership that exceed existing federal rules. The pro-gun bill also would have repealed the city\u2019s ban on semi-automatic weapons, most registration requirements for possession of firearms and a ban on owning ammunition. These aspects weren\u2019t addressed by the Supreme Court. Like the amicus brief, the District of Columbia Personal Protection Act was disproportionately supported by Republican members of Congress. A total of 184 Republican members of the House ultimately signed onto the legislation as co-sponsors compared to 64 Democrats. The bill died in committee and never made it to the floor for a vote. Gillibrand\u2019s support for such measures was key in her earning the backing of the NRA in her 2008 bid for re-election, with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA indicating she was a \u201csolidly pro-gun candidate.\u201d Gillibrand boasted of the \u201cA\u201d rating on her House website. \u201cAs a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, it is a privilege to have the endorsement of the NRA and the support of Upstate New York\u2019s gunowners and hunters,\u201d Gillibrand said at the time. The NRA\u2019s endorsement of Gillibrand cited her support for the brief. \u201cCongresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand has earned the endorsement of the NRA\u2019s Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) by consistently voting for the rights of law-abiding gun owners and hunters in the 110th Congress,\u201d said Chris W. Cox, chairman of NRA-PVF and NRA\u2019s chief lobbyist. \u201cShe believes that the Second Amendment is an individual right and she co-signed the congressional amicus brief in support of our individual right to keep and bear arms in the historic Heller case earlier this year. We are pleased to endorse this friend of freedom and fully support her reelection.\u201d After her appointment to the Senate in January 2009, Gillibrand moved sharply and quickly away from her conservative record on gun rights. She points to a visit in February of that year with the parents and classmates of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a 17-year-old high school student who was shot and killed in a club as transformative. Gillibrand vowed to take action to stop gun violence. \u201cThere\u2019s a very big difference between making sure hunters can hunt in upstate New York, because it\u2019s part of our heritage and our history and the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and fighting against gun violence,\u201d Gillibrand said at the time. \u201cAnd those are values and views that I\u2019ve always held \u2014 that we do need to fight against gun violence. We do need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\u201d And when a 2009 vote came on an amendment to ease firearm restrictions in Washington, DC, Gillibrand voted against it. By September 2010, her NRA grade changed from an \u201cA\u201d to an \u201cF.\u201d Meredith Kelly, Gillibrand\u2019s communications director for her presidential campaign, said she proudly earned the NRA\u2019s repudiation. \u201cSenator Gillibrand proudly earned an \u2018F\u2019 rating from the NRA a decade ago, and has been a passionate advocate for critical reforms to address the scourge of gun violence across our country ever since,\u201d Kelly told CNN\u2019s KFile in an email.",

            "article_content": "Robert Mueller\u2019s latest service to America is all but complete. But the reverberations from his yet-to-be-revealed report could amount to inestimable political and constitutional consequences. The conclusion of the special counsel\u2019s investigation was an important landmark in itself, at a moment in America\u2019s modern history when governing institutions are under intense strain. It demonstrated that so far at least, a credible legal examination is possible into the most explosive of charges against an unchained President, without interference and despite the bitter polarization of the times. The question now is whether everyone accepts the result. The nation could learn within days whether Mueller answered key inquiries: Did Trump cooperate with a hostile foreign power to win the 2016 election? Did he use that platform to seek to enrich himself with multi-billion dollar business deals in Russia? Did the President obstruct justice, including by firing FBI Director James Comey, in an effort to cover it all up? And is there any evidence to suggest why Trump often appears to be obedient to Russian President Vladimir Putin, following fears felt deep within the FBI that the US President was compromised? And can he explain the multiple suspicions contacts between Trump\u2019s associates and Russians \u2013 both before and after the election \u2013 and the lies they all told about those relationships? 11 looming questions now that Mueller's investigation is over Trump\u2019s team is already celebrating, claiming it is already clear that the President has already been vindicated since Mueller did not indict anyone for cooperating with Russian election meddling. The lack of charges against Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr. and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who were involved in a 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians offering \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton, especially disappointed his critics. Their escape proved the shrewdness of Trump\u2019s consistent messaging that the only question that mattered in an investigation that held Washington spellbound for two years was whether there was collusion. \u201cThe fat lady has sung,\u201d one Trump aide told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. For now, consistent with Mueller\u2019s tightly controlled investigation, no one outside the Justice Department knows what is in the report, how long it is and how much it deals with the President\u2019s own actions. But its delivery sets up an even bigger test for Washington\u2019s political institutions than those involved in getting it safely to its culmination. So much political and emotional capital has been invested in Mueller\u2019s probe by partisans on all sides that it\u2019s already clear that it will not mark a moment of catharsis that will once and for all drain the bitter poison of the 2016 election. Mueller is sure to anger millions of Americans who do not find validation for their set-in-stone political convictions in an assessment that could conceivably dictate the fate of the Trump presidency. The choices made in the coming days and the revelations to come are likely to ensure that whatever Mueller\u2019s report says, the question of Russia\u2019s assault on the last presidential election will stain the next one in 20 months. Attorney General William Barr, a pillar of the legal establishment, weeks into his second spell in the job, now assumes the crucial historic role of deciding how much of the report the White House will initially see, and the extent to which Mueller\u2019s conclusions will be shared with Congress and the public. Still, even if there is not legal liability for the President or his family in the Mueller report, it could still inflict significant political damage. What we've already learned about Mueller's investigation The biggest peril for Trump always lay in the obstruction question and whether there was conduct on his part that Mueller could not charge in deference to the tradition that a sitting President can\u2019t be indicted. Democrats wasted little time in demanding the full and swift release of Mueller\u2019s entire report, seeking the evidentiary haul behind to power their own investigations. But they have a sensitive set of decisions as well. If the report in any way vindicates Trump, Democrats could endanger their new House majority by continuing to pursue him aggressively. Republicans will argue that if Mueller, a decorated former Marine and ultimate Washington straight arrow, clears Trump, a new flurry of investigations would amount to presidential persecution. However the political battle shapes up, it\u2019s important to realize that the Mueller probe \u2013 though it has dominated Washington\u2019s attention for nearly two years \u2013 is only one piece of the legal puzzle gathering around Trump. It is unclear how much evidence Mueller can present on the question of contacts between Russians and people in Trump\u2019s orbit since the counter-intelligence side of the investigation \u2013 which could still be going on at the FBI \u2013 involves classified information, sources and methods. There are also multiple criminal and civil cases threatening Trump, his businesses, his inaugural committee and his presidential transition. The most perilous appears to be one launched by the US attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York that has already implicated Trump in campaign finance offenses over hush money payments made to women who alleged affairs with him before the election. Then there are multiple investigations launched by Democratic House committees that if they do not result in grounds or the political motivation for an impeachment drive, could be used to make a case against Trump to lay before voters in 2020. What Mueller's probe has already revealed about Trump Barr spent several hours reading the Mueller report in his office after the special counsel handed it over just before 5 p.m. ET on Friday afternoon. Now he must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to share parts of it with White House lawyers in anticipation of executive privilege assertions \u2013 a move that could give Trump and his team the chance to mount a pre-emptive defense. In a surprise, a Justice Department official said that Barr could brief lawmakers on his takeaways from the Mueller report as soon as this weekend. That means that the crucial answers from Mueller\u2019s investigation could emerge publicly more quickly than expected. Still, a constitutional showdown still seems likely. Evidence gathered by Mueller about the firing of Comey, the President\u2019s conversations about Russia with his fired national security adviser Mike Flynn and his conversations with aides about the Trump Tower meeting once he was President could all be subject to executive privilege assertions. Democrats with subpoena battle could then launch a court battle that could drag on for months. And Democrats are already threatening action if the whole of the report, and all of its supporting evidence is not quickly released. They also may call on the special counsel to explain himself in person. \u201cI think the American people need to hear from Mr. Mueller,\u201d said California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, on CNN. One of the difficulties in assessing how the Mueller drama will unfold from here is that the structure of his report remains unclear \u2013 even though a Justice Department official described it as \u201ccomprehensive.\u201d Will he, for instance, confine himself to an examination of criminal matters \u2013 and a explanation of the charges he laid against 37 people and entities, including associates of Trump like former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump\u2019s ex-attorney Michael Cohen and his reasons for not charging other key players? Or has the special counsel told a story of political offenses committed by the President and his team, that could be potentially relevant to the question of impeachment? How has he dealt with the intense public interest in his investigation and the President\u2019s conduct \u2013 and the wider mission of uncovering and explaining an attempt by Russian intelligence agencies to sway the 2016 election to Trump? It must have come as a huge relief for the President that no one in his immediate family was indicted and Mueller did not lay charges on the question of conspiracy to collude with Russia to interfere in the election. There have been plenty of dark days for the President during the Russia investigation. But the news that Mueller would make no more indictments arrived as he settled into his Mar-a-Lago resort for a weekend with friends \u2013 surrounded by his legal and political teams. One person close to Trump told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown that \u201cwe won\u201d and that the campaign \u2013 which has been tainted for two years by the suggestion of wrongdoing \u2013 was absolved. \u201cZero indictments mean we\u2019re clear,\u201d the person said. Trump\u2019s legal team can also claim a victory since they were able to protect their client by not permitting him to sit for an interview under oath with Mueller \u2013 a situation that could have exposed the President to the possibility of perjury. The President did provide answers to written questions filed by Mueller, with the help of his counsel. Still, the President\u2019s team faces nervous hours until they can learn the entirety of the report. Whether Mueller finds a pattern of repeated obstruction by the President remains a mystery. It\u2019s also possible that the special counsel outlines a pattern of behavior related to Russia, that if known by voters before November 2016, would have appeared deeply unpatriotic and made it impossible for him to win the presidency. While there was a mood of celebration in the Trump camp on Friday night \u2013 things could quickly change. The President has made clear that if Mueller delivers a result favorable to him, he will see the report as accurate and fair. Despite months of angry tweets and comments insulting Mueller and his team, the President is likely to quickly pivot to using the special counsel\u2019s sterling reputation to his own advantage. But if he is criticized in the report, it will validate in his own mind, the endless claims that the whole exercise was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d all along. The President\u2019s legal team has gamed out a range of strategies to cope with a report that is highly critical of Trump, that is mixed, or offers him a measure of validation, CNN has reported. Indications that Barr may be able to brief lawmakers soon about the report sparked immediate speculation, alongside the lack of new indictments, that the Mueller report could be more favorable to the President than expected. Democrats appeared to be preparing for that possibility by stressing that the report was just the beginning of a new phase of the Russia intrigue. In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, warned that Barr should not give the White House a \u201csneak preview\u201d of the report. In an apparently coordinated messaging blitz, key Democratic leaders and presidential candidates issued statements demanding the immediate public release of Mueller\u2019s entire report and evidence backing it up. Such a trove would be valuable for the multiple House committees that are delving into almost every aspect of Trump\u2019s business and political affairs. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff made clear that his investigation would look at questions that may not be covered by Mueller, including why Manafort gave polling data to a Russian contact with links to Kremlin intelligence agencies. He also pledged to look at whether Trump was compromised by his business or other links with Russia from before he became President. \u201cIf they are not answered, we are going to have to answer them,\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. His comments showed that while Mueller\u2019s decision to file a report and end his investigation was a milestone moment, it was also the start of a new beginning of the Russia saga. CNN\u2019s Laura Jarrett, Pamela Brown, Jim Acosta, Marshall Cohen, Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has been president for 792 days. Special counsel Robert Mueller has been on the job \u2013 investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and the possibility of collusion between the Russians and members of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 for 675 days. That all came to a head at 5 p.m. Eastern, when the Justice Department announced that Mueller had delivered his investigation to Attorney General William Barr. While we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the report, we do know that this marks a major milestone: Mueller\u2019s investigation, which has occupied 85% of Trump\u2019s presidency, is now finished. We are likely to look back on Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 no matter what the report actually says \u2013 as \u201cbefore Mueller report\u201d and \u201cafter the Mueller report.\u201d Barr told congressional leaders in a letter Friday that he may be able to advise them on the \u201cprincipal conclusions\u201d of the Mueller report \u201cas soon as this weekend.\u201d This all began on May 17, 2017, when Mueller was appointed as special counsel by deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. In the intervening 22 months (statistics courtesy of CNN Mueller probe expert Marshall Cohen): Given the length of the Mueller probe, the number of charges it has produced and Trump\u2019s unrelenting negative attacks on Mueller and his team, it\u2019s normal to see the conclusion of the Mueller report as the beginning of the end of all of this.

Except that even with Mueller\u2019s probe now shuttered, we still don\u2019t immediately know a) what he submitted of his findings to Barr b) what Barr will redact c) whether the White House will be able to see the report before Congress and/or exert executive privilege on parts of it d) when Congress will get the report and how extensive or not the report will be and e) when \u2013 and if \u2013 the report is made public. That leaves off the many House Democratic investigations into the Trump administration, the possibility of bringing Mueller in front of Congress to testify over the report, and the likely legal fights that will follow any redactions and executive privilege claims. See what I mean? End of the beginning. Not the beginning of the end. (Thanks, Sir Winston!) Still, it is an end \u2013 if not the end. The Point: With the news that Mueller is done, Trump\u2019s presidency as we have known it since, well, almost its first days, will begin to change.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump, the President who refused to release his tax returns, just made an unexpected gesture towards transparency, saying he\u2019d be happy for Americans to see Robert Mueller\u2019s final report. His comment is probably worth taking with a large pinch of salt. After all, just last week, Trump tweeted \u201cthere should be no Mueller report.\u201d The President, with his talent for shifting the terms of a debate, weighed in on the fate of Mueller\u2019s yet-to-be-filed final report before heading to Ohio on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I mean, frankly, I told the House, \u2018If you want, let them see it,\u2019\u201d Trump said when asked whether the American public had the right to see the fruits of the special counsel\u2019s labors. Trump\u2019s offer was surprising since it appeared to conflict with a long record of attempts to either obstruct or discredit Mueller\u2019s investigation, which he has branded a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and something no President should suffer. Indeed, once he returned from Ohio Wednesday night, Trump tweeted some commentary from Fox News: \u201c\u2018The reason we have the Special Counsel investigation is that James Comey (a dirty cop) leaked his memos to a friend, who leaked them to the press, on purpose.\u2019 @KennedyNation Totally illegal!\u201d New Mueller probe revelations explain Trump's rage It also came amid concerns on Capitol Hill that the White House will try to gut Mueller\u2019s findings before they can reach lawmakers and a new CNN poll showed that a huge majority of the public wants to see the results. It is often difficult to know whether Trump is working to a long-term strategic plan, testing out new political ground or just riffing in the moment to get past bad news and onto another subject. But it\u2019s hard to take his comment seriously, partly because it recalls his frequent statements that he\u2019d love to sit down in an interview with Mueller, an offer that never appears to have been taken seriously by his lawyers. Trump provided the special counsel with a set of written answers to questions prepared in coordination with his legal team, but never went head-to-head with prosecutors. With his comment on Wednesday, the President could have simply been recognizing strong support among Americans for a public accounting of Mueller\u2019s work \u2013 in the belief that he could not shape it without first acknowledging it. The CNN/SSRS poll released on Wednesday found that 87% of Americans believe that the Mueller report should be made public. Just 9% disagree. The President\u2019s sincerity is also called into question by a tweet last weekend that appeared to signal he was more interested in going through the motions of accountability than adopting it as a practice. \u201cOn the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn\u2019t matter. Play along with the game!\u201d Trump wrote. Trump\u2019s Democratic foes don\u2019t really think he wants the Mueller report made public. \u201cI don\u2019t believe him because he has obstructed every step along the way,\u201d Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California said on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on Wednesday. White House expects to see Mueller findings before they go to Congress Much of the White House\u2019s strategy, once Mueller has filed his final report with Attorney General William Barr, will depend on what it says. Trump insisted on Wednesday that he did not know what was in the report, and it\u2019s not clear whether he has been briefed by subordinates read in on the investigation, for instance, former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. If the report ends up being critical of the President \u2013 after an investigation into alleged cooperation between his campaign team and Russian election meddling and claims he obstructed justice \u2013 Trump will have a strong incentive to suppress it. A less damaging result would give the White House the chance to turn on a dime after months attacking the special counsel, by using Mueller\u2019s sterling personal reputation to its own benefit. Assessing the battle to come is also difficult because no one knows what form Mueller\u2019s conclusions will take. He could elect to provide Barr with a bare-bones explanation of why he chose to pursue some Trump associates, such as former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, and not others. Or, given the intense public interest in his investigation, Mueller could deliver a more expansive assessment. It will then be up to the attorney general to decide what Congress, or the public, can see. There\u2019s another reason why Trump\u2019s backing for a public release of a Mueller report should not be taken at face value. While suddenly throwing up a trial balloon of cooperation, the White House is girding for a period of political confrontation once the Mueller probe ends. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown reported this week that White House lawyers expect to see whatever version of Mueller\u2019s findings Barr decides to send to Congress. Scrubbing the report for executive privilege claims is well within the purview of the White House counsel\u2019s office \u2013 after all, their charge is to defend the institution of the presidency, not the individual President they serve. But the chance for the White House to view the report ahead of its release to lawmakers will certainly spark a clash with Democrats who believe Trump\u2019s team will do everything it can to suppress Mueller\u2019s final conclusions. And sweeping claims of executive privilege could trigger an intricate legal battle that could go all the way up to the Supreme Court, and put off any day of reckoning for Trump in Congress for months, even if the report brings bad news. Another issue is that as much of Mueller\u2019s investigation represents a counter intelligence probe into election meddling by Russian spy agencies, some findings might need to remain classified. White House misses Democrats' deadline to turn over docs The struggle over disclosure is already getting a preview. Democratic committee chairmen are struggling to get the White House to comply with document requests to support their massive investigations into Trump\u2019s campaign, transition, inaugural committee, business and presidency. \u201cI want the public to understand us as we paint this picture of what is happening in our country, the stonewalling, the lies,\u201d House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Wednesday. \u201cI do not want us to be distracted from the truth,\u201d he added. The White House has also missed a deadline to provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee. Trump\u2019s comment about the release of the Mueller report came as he road tested a counterattack that is building on an escalation of his \u201cno collusion\u201d mantra and repeated assaults on the Mueller \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The messaging could carry the President through the critical final stages of the Mueller investigation, and also frame a pillar of his re-election argument as he heads out onto the campaign trail ahead of the 2020 campaign. The plan is clear: Delegitimize Mueller personally and professionally, paint his findings as a deep state coup that trashes votes of his millions of Trump supporters, and argue that he\u2019s bulletproof since he\u2019s doing such a great job. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of interesting that a man out of the blue just writes a report. I got 306 electoral votes against 223. That\u2019s a tremendous victory. I\u2019ve got 63 million votes, and now somebody just writes a report. I think it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Trump said Wednesday. The argument that an investigation into a democratically elected President could amount to a coup in all but name could be a powerful one. Trump is not the only senior Washington politician who is preparing the political terrain for the eventual filing of the Mueller report. His line of attack helps explain the strategy adopted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when faced with demands from the Democratic grassroots for the impeachment of the President even before Mueller\u2019s report. \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d Pelosi said in a Washington Post interview earlier this month. The speaker believes the process of impeachment is so damaging to the nation\u2019s political fabric that unless there is some truly grievous offense uncovered by investigations, the proper remedy for a presidency she sees as unethical and disastrous, is at the ballot box. The CNN poll suggests that Pelosi may have convinced some Democrats. In December, 80% of self-identified Democrats said they were in favor of impeachment \u2013 that now stands at 68%, a 12-point dip.",

            "article_content": "The sound of silence is driving Washington to distraction. The clearest signs yet that the monastic special counsel Robert Mueller may be about to file his final report with Attorney General William Barr have sent Beltway insiders to a state of nervous alert. But there is no report yet. So White House lawyers, Trump campaign flacks, key congressional offices and newsrooms are left counting the hours, poised to shape the end game of the most important investigation into a President\u2019s behavior in at least 20 years. For everyone involved, it\u2019s like waiting for a jury in a big trial to reach its verdict: long stretches of edgy idleness are laced with the prospect of frenetic action and hugely consequential outcomes that could unfold at a moment\u2019s notice. Mueller wait-and-see mode hangs over White House, too This moment of political purgatory comes after a turbulent two years packed with revelations about covert contacts between associates of President Donald Trump and Russia, the sight of Trump acolytes being sent to jail after sensational court dramas and a ferocious campaign by the President to discredit Mueller. When he finally files his report, the special counsel will open a new chapter in the Russia story \u2013 even though it could take weeks for most Americans to learn what he learned during his investigation. Depending on his conclusions, he could either lift the cloud of suspicion over alleged links to Russia that has darkened every day of the Trump administration. Or if he finds serious wrongdoing, Mueller could trigger a constitutional showdown that puts a presidency in peril. Trump, in an interview with Fox Business Network that was released Friday morning, spoke ominously about the aftermath of Mueller\u2019s report, saying \u201cpeople will not stand for it\u201d if the report casts him in a bad light. Just after sunrise Thursday, Mueller was met by camera flashes as he steered his car into the underground garage of the building where he has based his nearly two-year investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling scheme. A suddenly swelled media pack, huddling with their cameras under umbrellas in a chilly late March deluge, waited outside all day, vainly on guard for activity that could give some indication Mueller\u2019s time was up. Tension simmered at the White House as the President\u2019s lawyers tested different scenarios that could ensue after Mueller files his report. Like everyone else in Washington, Trump\u2019s team was in the dark, thanks to the leak-proof cone of silence that has enveloped Mueller, who has barely uttered a public word since he took his commission two years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re tea leaf reading like everyone else,\u201d one White House official said. Time hung heavy at the Justice Department. Reporters set up text chains to ensure that they didn\u2019t miss any breaking news on lunch or bathroom breaks. ABC reporter Mike Levine wrote on Twitter that he encountered Barr in the building and got a \u201cdeath stare\u201d when he asked him, \u201cIs today the day?\u201d In an information blackout, every anecdote is a potential clue. When Mueller\u2019s soon to depart right hand man Andrew Weissmann sported a tan suit Wednesday, reporters and legal insiders wondered whether his ensemble hinted at an end of term mood in the special counsel\u2019s office. The starchy Mueller, a former FBI director and decorated Marine, is famous for selecting a crisp white shirt, sober suit and neutral tie every morning, and encouraging subordinates to do the same. Signs of an imminent twist in the tale of the Russia story drew several key players back on stage. Former FBI Director James Comey, whose firing by Trump led to Mueller\u2019s appointment, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that even though he thought the President was morally unfit to serve, he wasn\u2019t hoping for him to be exposed as a criminal. \u201cI\u2019m not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work, charge whatever cases warrant charging and report on his work,\u201d Comey wrote. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a pre-emptive shot in USA Today that any attempt by Barr to cover up Mueller\u2019s findings would \u201cstain the (Justice Department\u2019s) reputation for years to come.\u201d A fundraising committee affiliated with Trump\u2019s re-election campaign sought to fire up the President\u2019s base \u2013 his best shield against a political death blow if the Mueller report contains damaging revelations. \u201cThis Witch Hunt has been orchestrated by loser Democrats and their friends in the Fake News Media,\u201d the email read. \u201cThey claim they plan to release the report \u2018soon\u2019 but they\u2019ve been saying that for OVER 2 YEARS.\u201d Despite the explosion of anticipation, there is every chance that when, Mueller\u2019s report is finally filed, there will be a sense of anti-climax. The first question will be a simple one. \u201cIs he in fact done?\u201d said CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin, a former colleague of Mueller. \u201cIs he telling the attorney general \u2018my investigation is over,\u2019 \u201d Zeldin added. It may be days, weeks or even months before most of America learns what is in the report. According to Justice Department regulations, Mueller is required to file a confidential report with Barr. Then it will be up to Barr to decide how much of it can be disclosed to Congress and the public in his own report. Barr said in his recent confirmation hearing that favored transparency but only within the scope of department rules and the law. That led some Democrats to warn the administration could try to suppress Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cThe attorney general, as I understand the rules, would report to Congress about the conclusion of the investigation,\u201d Barr said in his hearing. \u201cI believe there may be discretion there about what the attorney general can put in that report,\u201d he said. Barr will also have to decide whether information in Mueller\u2019s assessment is likely to raise White House executive privilege assertions \u2013 to protect consultations between the President and his closest advisers, or given that part of the probe is a counter-intelligence investigation should remain classified. Trump on Wednesday muddied the waters on the question of transparency, telling reporters that he would be happy for the report to be released. Yet his sincerity is questionable given a weekend tweet in which he appeared to advise Republicans in Congress to go ahead with the \u201cgame\u201d around the report\u2019s disclosure. Mystery also clouds the kind of report that Mueller will file. One model would be for the special counsel to adopt a traditional, sparse prosecutorial approach to explain the cases he initiated and decisions he made not to charge other people linked to the case. Still, a pared-down approach would ignore the significant public interest in his investigation \u2013 given that it involved a question of whether an elected President conspired with a foreign power to win election. Given the prevailing Justice Department opinion that a sitting President cannot be charged in a criminal case, it\u2019s possible that Mueller could put details of any incriminating conduct by Trump in his report. If Barr felt compelled to pass the information onto Congress, it would be up to lawmakers to decide whether to institute the constitutional duty of impeachment proceedings to judge presidential wrongdoing. As soon as Mueller files his report, the game of expectations setting and vying for political advantage will begin. If Barr does not release something in short order, Democrats in Congress are likely to demand disclosure, armed with their subpoena power. And Washington being Washington, leaks can\u2019t be ruled out. Anything short of a finding that Trump aides openly colluded with Russia in 2016 and obstructed justice multiple times to cover it up \u2013 for instance in the sacking of Comey \u2013 is likely to be portrayed by the White House as a victory. \u201cThis clears the decks for us,\u201d a Trump campaign adviser told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, reflecting a perceptible optimism in the President\u2019s camp in recent days that the report will not damage the commander in chief. Though the President still faces multiple criminal and civil investigations into his inauguration, transition, and personal and business affairs, exoneration by Mueller would be hugely significant. After repeatedly branding Mueller as an out of control prosecutor bent on a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, Trump would seek to play up his sterling character. The Trump adviser even described the special counsel as a \u201cboy scout\u201d on Thursday. But the President has also taken care to road test an argument he could use in the opposite scenario, arguing that Mueller should never have been appointed, and that the investigation itself represents a de-facto political coup. \u201cI had the greatest electoral victory \u2013 one of them \u2013 in the history of our country. Tremendous success. Tens of millions of voters. And now somebody\u2019s going to write a report who never got a vote,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. Democrats are also gaming out how to respond to their report. Critical findings by Mueller would immediately boost demands in the liberal grass roots for impeachment. But if Trump escapes censure, Democrats must consider whether their own vast investigation into Trump\u2019s life and political career could come across to voters in 2020 as overkill, and offer an opening to the President.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump looks \u2013 and is acting \u2013 rattled and encircled by the Russia investigation. And a series of fresh disclosures on Tuesday show there is every reason for him to feel threatened by the vast shadow it is casting over his life, business and presidency. Newly unsealed court documents detailing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s activity reveal an investigative field of breathtaking scope and a prosecutorial machine that ratcheted quickly up in mid-2017. The search warrants targeting Trump\u2019s ex-personal lawyer Michael Cohen offer a glimpse of the covert world of the probe. As is often the case with Mueller, they give only a tantalizing hint of the wider, yet still hidden, puzzle. In court filing, Robert Mueller's team says it's very busy this week But such disclosures are almost never good news for Trump. There is enough to explain from Tuesday\u2019s reveal why the investigation must be weighing on Trump\u2019s spirits, and driving his angry Twitter outbursts. The vast breadth of the investigation by various jurisdictions also could offer a rich seam for Democratic House chairmen should they eventually subpoena primary evidence uncovered by Mueller and other prosecutors. And the release underlines that various investigations that are penetrating deep into Trump\u2019s business, personal and political life are likely to be haunting the President for years to come \u2013 even after Mueller has left the stage. READ: Newly released Michael Cohen court documents The pages of warrants make clear that the investigation into whether the Trump Organization is implicated in the campaign finance case involving his hush money payments to women before the 2016 election is still open. Eighteen-and-a-half blacked-out pages at the end of one document under the title \u201cThe Illegal Campaign Contribution Scheme\u201d almost certainly contain details of Trump\u2019s interactions with Cohen. That prosecutors from the Southern District of New York believe those elements need to be kept out of the public eye suggests that their investigations \u2013 which have already indirectly implicated Trump \u2013 are not over. \u201cThey are not done. We have seen this in filings over and over again,\u201d Preet Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. So Trump cannot yet be sure whether his family members or top business associates in his firm could face criminal jeopardy. For the President, who seeks to exert dominance over every room, situation or relationship, the lack of control over the fate of his own clan and the business that bears his name as prosecutors bear down must be close to intolerable. Some legal observers see the work of the Southern District as Trump\u2019s most perilous legal front, even more so than Mueller\u2019s look at whether there was coordination between Trump campaign aides and Russia and whether the President obstructed justice to cover it up. While a sitting President cannot be indicted, according to current Justice Department guidance, Trump cannot be certain that he will not be prosecuted for campaign finance violations when he eventually leaves office. \u201cIf I was Donald Trump, I would be scared,\u201d Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d The fact that prosecutors have already endorsed Cohen\u2019s statement that he made the payments in violation of campaign finance laws at the direction of Trump means \u201cthere may be another shoe to drop,\u201d said Bharara. \u201cThere may be other people who are assisting or who are conspiring, up to and including the President, and they haven\u2019t decided how they want to proceed on that,\u201d he added. Michael Cohen warrants show how the FBI can unlock your phone and track your movements Tuesday\u2019s documents also contain more evidence that Trump associates, in this case Cohen, appeared to have at least indirect connections to powerful Russians. They show that Cohen was paid more than $500,000 through his company as a business consultant from January to August 2017 by Columbus Nova LLC., an investment management firm that is linked to Russian national Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg is an oligarch \u2013 with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 who is under US sanctions regarding election interference. Columbus Nova said in a statement that neither Vekselberg nor anyone outside the firm had been involved in the decision to hire Cohen or to provide funding for his work. Cohen, who will go to jail in May after he admitted lying to Congress and for tax and fraud offenses, was not charged with unlawfully acting as an unregistered foreign lobbyist. But he is far from the only Trump associate to have suggestions of links that can be traced back to prominent Russians. Many of those Trump allies have been caught by Mueller trying to hide such relationships. The question of whether foreign influence and quid pro quos were in play during the Trump campaign for the presidency, and early in his administration, gets to the heart of what Mueller is charged with investigating. Methods used by investigators to track Cohen, including state-of-the-art techniques targeting Apple devices, and the revelation of their sweep through the lawyer\u2019s emails and telephone communications may fuel Trump\u2019s fury about what he sees as the special counsel\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d They also suggest that Mueller and his counterparts in New York may know a lot about the communications of people around Trump during parts of the 2016 campaign and early in the presidency. The documents show that Mueller had shown probable cause that Cohen had committed a crime to obtain warrants for two email accounts as far back as the summer of 2017, nine months before FBI agents acting on behalf of New York prosecutors raided Cohen\u2019s office and residences. Trump\u2019s siege mentality is unlikely to be helped by the simultaneous publication Tuesday of a double page spread in his hometown newspaper, The New York Times, revealing his complicated financial relationship with Deutsche Bank. Although the article did not show any illegality, it is the kind of unflattering deep dive critique of his personal and business practices that Trump abhors. Given the avalanche of revelations, it\u2019s not surprising that the President is sometimes prone to isolated outbursts of fury directed at Mueller. \u201cTHIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!\u201d Trump tweeted out of the blue on Saturday. Tuesday\u2019s revelations also provided the context against which the President stood in the White House Rose Garden and claimed the real \u201ccollusion\u201d in US politics was between social media companies opposed to conservatives. Trump praised Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 a leader with autocratic tendencies in his own image \u2013 of buying into his \u201cfake news\u201d narrative. \u201cIt seems to be if they\u2019re conservative, if they\u2019re Republicans, if they\u2019re in a certain group, there\u2019s discrimination, and big discrimination,\u201d Trump added. Claims that the President is being muffled on social media hardly seem credible given that he has 59 million Twitter followers and can set the political agenda by banging out a few characters. It\u2019s also notable that Mueller has indicted three Russian entities and 13 Russian nationals in connection with Moscow\u2019s operation to use social media to interfere in the 2016 election, sow political discord and elect Trump. Rosenstein staying on at Justice Department  'a little longer' than anticipated Washington has been on edge for several weeks over expectations that Mueller is getting toward the end of the road. But there was a new wrinkle on Tuesday with the news that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has overseen much of the Mueller probe, is not yet ready to leave his job. Rosenstein had been expected to leave in mid-March, now that a new attorney general, William Barr, who is not recused from the Russia probe like his predecessor Jeff Sessions, has taken office. Rosenstein will now stay \u201ca little longer\u201d than originally anticipated. A source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown that Rosenstein is waiting for Mueller to deliver his report to Barr. Rosenstein sees himself as the \u201cheat shield\u201d since he appointed Mueller, and could be in position to take the \u201chit\u201d if controversy explodes when the report drops, the source said. White House misses Democrats' deadline to turn over docs While Trump may feel increasingly isolated, there are new indications that Democrats who have launched their own vast investigation against Trump world will encounter significant difficulties. The White House has missed a House Judiciary Committee deadline to turn over scores of records related to an investigation over whether Trump abused power. Some former officials who received letters from the committee requesting documents, including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former deputy counsel Annie Donaldson, are referring them to the White House. Republican aides said the committee had gotten responses from only eight of the 81 officials who had received letters from the committee earlier this month, and a ninth had mailed documents, though they had yet to be received. Democrats painted a more positive picture, but the speed bumps were a sign of the tortuous road of subpoenas and legal challenges ahead as House Democrats face White House resistance. People outside the government, however, are more exposed to subpoenas than others in the administration, as they cannot wage long fights citing executive privilege concerns as an excuse not to hand over documents.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s entire life story of fighting and surviving, of cheating personal and professional ruin over and over, has delivered him to his greatest battle yet \u2013 the one to save his presidency. Trump is facing down a swarm of investigations from multiple congressional committees, a special counsel, state and federal prosecutors, and private litigants. His entire life is under scrutiny. But the fight back has begun. If there is any President who could bear such strain, who would perhaps relish the struggle, prosper amid its cacophony and be willing to cross all sorts of conventional lines to stay alive, it would surely be Trump. As a youth at New York Military Academy, the future President learned one thing above all else: \u201clife is about survival. It\u2019s always about survival,\u201d according to writer Michael D\u2019Antonio in his biography of Trump. Republicans reject calls to probe Trump role in hush-money payments It\u2019s been Trump\u2019s motto ever since, no matter the collateral damage and the cost of legal battles and reputational hits, personal scandals and bankruptcies. Now America is about to be dragged along on Trump\u2019s most existential struggle yet. Survival in a personal and political sense now defines his life, with Robert Mueller\u2019s report expected to be filed soon and Democrats unfurling an oversight blitz that could lead to impeachment. When House Democrats on Monday unveiled a mammoth document demand from a list of 81 potential witnesses linked to Trump\u2019s businesses, campaigns, presidency and family, he and aides initially pledged cooperation. But the mask soon slipped. Trump responded on Tuesday according to his creed, with a promise of all-out confrontation and a searing blast at his enemies. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace to our country,\u201d he said, accusing Democrats of being consumed by anger at their loss in 2016, and framing the coming fight as an extension of his 2020 re-election campaign. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, set the vituperative tone of a fight against a Democratic majority seeking to expose the President as historically corrupt. \u201cDemocrats have embarked on a fishing expedition because they are terrified that their two year false narrative of \u2018Russia collusion\u2019 is crumbling,\u201d Sanders said in a statement on Monday night. \u201cThe Democrats are not after the truth, they are after the President.\u201d Democratic investigations now target Trump's entire world Sanders and everyone else inside the White House are about to endure the bitter, full-on misery of a multi-front oversight campaign. That means a blizzard of subpoenas, officials being hauled up to Capitol Hill to testify under penalty of perjury and a mountain of legal bills. But Trump has lived in the eye of such storms for much of his adult life, and he comes to the fight with certain advantages. His clash with House Democrats will give him the foil in the form of his Democratic tormentors that he\u2019s lacked ever since his 2016 campaign. This President is always most effective with an enemy to define himself against. The duel will serve to unite the Republican Party in Washington behind the President \u2013 amid some signs of cracks opening in the GOP edifice in the Senate, at least, over his national emergency declaration. It will be a rallying moment that will enrage and enthuse Trump\u2019s base ahead of the 2020 campaign. That may mean he can avoid risky strategies, such as the disastrous government shutdown, to keep his troops motivated. Republicans are already working off the Trump playbook, which is designed to present him as the victim of unfair presidential persecution by Democrats. \u201cHe just believes they are out to take a wrecking ball to his life,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Tuesday after meeting the President. \u201cThey\u2019ll go nuts.\u201d Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned that the Democratic investigation was less about finding the truth and more about ousting a President. \u201cIt\u2019s all about setting up the stage for impeachment proceedings. That\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Cornyn told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Republicans make such arguments in the knowledge that the nation, despite Trump\u2019s unpopularity and widespread suspicions about his conduct, is not yet ready for the trauma of the third impeachment drama in 50 years. Still, a new Quinnipiac University poll shows a public appetite for investigations. Some 64% of respondents thought Trump had committed crimes before he became President. Even 33% of Republicans thought so. But Trump\u2019s approval rating among GOP voters still stood at 82%, suggesting that some of their numbers think he\u2019s a criminal but don\u2019t care. But only 35% of those polled thought that Democrats should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President \u2013 a number that explains the party\u2019s caution in the messaging around its investigations. Multiple presidential aides told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that they were surprised at the expansive nature of House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler\u2019s document request. The belief is that Democrats \u2013 blasting the White House on multiple fronts \u2013 miscalculated by not making a more targeted opening burst. Officials are already planning to push back on the expansive witness demands and to preserve what they say is the President\u2019s right to confidentiality, a sign that grueling fights are looming over executive privilege. There were already signs of that strategy rolling into action on Tuesday. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings complained that the White House had refused requests for documents and witnesses for an inquiry into what he says are security clearance \u201cabuses\u201d in the West Wing. \u201cThe White House\u2019s argument defies the Constitutional separation of powers, decades of precedent before this Committee, and just plain common-sense,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. A White House official, however, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta that the Maryland Democrat was demanding documents he was not entitled to under the law. The swift escalation of the dispute left the committee to consider whether to issue subpoenas to get information, a step that could spark a legal scenario that could be repeated scores of times in the coming months. Prolonged legal tussles will not just frustrate Democrats. They will take months, churn all the way through the court system and delay any final accounting for the President \u2013 possibly until the heat of the 2020 campaign. Executive privilege \u2013 the idea that the President has a right to confidential counsel from top officials \u2013 has not been widely litigated in the courts, meaning that legal cases might eventually make their laborious way all the way to the Supreme Court. That would suit Trump just fine. The coming battle will be fought on a legal as well as a political front. Some Washington veterans remember that the Republican impeachment of Bill Clinton in the late 1990s eventually backfired on the party, given that the public didn\u2019t believe the President\u2019s transgression \u2013 effectively lying under oath about sex \u2013 met the constitutional bar of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Clinton, with his legendary capacity to compartmentalize, presided over a White House that fought hard against Capitol Hill investigations. But he also went out of his way to show that he was doing his job, leading the country through a period of economic prosperity, in a way that made efforts to bring him down appear petty and inappropriate. \u201cThese allegations are false and I need to go back to work for the American people,\u201d Clinton said in 1998. One of Clinton\u2019s antagonists, who voted as a House member to impeach him, drew lessons from that long-ago fight. \u201cYou just have to put your head down, fight back and govern the country \u2013 that\u2019s what Clinton did,\u201d Graham said, saying Trump should now challenge the Democrats to \u201cfix problems.\u201d There was more than an echo of Clintonian rhetoric in Trump\u2019s public statement on Tuesday, delivered as he signed an executive order tackling an epidemic of suicide among veterans. \u201cInstead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing health care, instead of doing so many things that they should be doing, they want to play games,\u201d Trump said of his Democratic opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad because I\u2019d rather see them do legislation.\u201d The Clinton parallel may not be exact, however. At the start of his impeachment drama in 1998, Clinton was far more popular than Trump, with his approval rating measured by Gallup at 58%. He never went below 60% in the brutal year that followed, hit 73% after he was impeached and settled at 66% after he was acquitted in a Senate trial. According to the Quinnipiac poll, Trump is at 38% approval. And while a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll had him at 46%, his numbers rarely move beyond a narrow range, with favorability well below a majority of voters. That means Trump may not be able to bank on high personal popularity during the most dangerous political moments of his presidency. His scattershot approach to the office suggests he lacks the discipline that sustained Clinton. And Trump\u2019s incessant claims that he is the victim of \u201choax\u201d investigations and attempts to tear down the guardrails surrounding his office often give the impression that he has something to hide. And for all the years of controversies and scandals that plagued Clinton, the 42nd President was never the focus of so many credible civil and criminal investigations as are bearing down on Trump.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday President Donald Trump suggested his administration won\u2019t cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 recent request for information and documents from more than 80 groups, organizations and individuals, as part of their investigation into Trump\u2019s campaign, businesses, post-election transition and administration. In doing so, Trump tried to draw a comparison to former President Barack Obama by claiming he didn\u2019t comply with congressional inquiries either. \u201cPresident Obama, from what they tell me, was under a similar kind of a thing,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give one letter. They didn\u2019t do anything. They didn\u2019t give one letter of the requests. Many requests were made. They didn\u2019t give a letter.\u201d Facts First: Though Trump is vague about what exactly he\u2019s referring to, it\u2019s untrue to say that the Obama administration refused to comply with congressional requests for information. There were a handful of occasions where the Obama administration initially rebuffed extensive congressional document requests, but ultimately complied, either voluntarily or under court order. During the Fast and Furious botched weapons sting investigation, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee in 2012 recommended that then-Attorney General Eric Holder be cited for contempt of Congress for failing to turn over requested documents. They made the recommendation after Obama asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the committee. But two years later, under court order, the Obama Justice Department did turn over nearly 65,000 pages of Fast and Furious-related documents. And in 2016, the Justice Department released additional documents pertaining to Fast and Furious, as ordered by a federal judge. In addition, Obama administration officials provided requested documents during congressional inquiries into the Benghazi attack that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. However, when the committee asked the President to answer questions about the attack in Libya, his administration rebuffed the request. During Obama\u2019s first term, his administration said it would not comply with requests to turn over internal White House communications related to the solar company Solyndra, which received a $535 million loan guarantee from the federal government and then went bankrupt. A year later, the administration turned over 432 pages of email and other documents. On Tuesday, former senior Obama administration officials pushed back on Trump\u2019s comments, insisting there was extensive cooperation during past investigations. \u201cIf there was no cooperation, how was there material for seven Benghazi investigations?\u201d one official said, noting the release of Benghazi documents triggered Clinton email server stories. A separate official, former deputy press secretary Eric Schultz tweeted, \u201cFrom 2011 - 2016 the Obama White House produced hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress on Solyndra, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards rule, Deep Water Horizon spill, ACA (Affordable Care Act), ACA website, Clean Water Rule, and Ft Hood shooting.\u201d Andy Wright, a former associate counsel to President Barack Obama in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and a former staff director and counsel to the House Oversight Committee, flatly denied that the Obama administration did not respond to congressional oversight inquiries. \u201cHe is prone to being sort of all or nothing,\u201d Wright said of Trump. But \u201ccompartmentalization is part of the job.\u201d \u201cIn order to be able to handle oversight in a good faith manner you\u2019ve got to be honest and you\u2019ve got to be able to compartmentalize on the different requests,\u201d he continued, later adding that though he doesn\u2019t think this is Trump\u2019s final position, \u201cthis is the initial position.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Allie Malloy contribute to this report.",

            "article_content": "Nearly everyone in Donald Trump\u2019s world just became a potential witness. House Democrats are laying down a vast net as they ramp up their investigation into deep tracts of the President\u2019s personal, business and political life, with a breathtaking document request from a list of 81 people, agencies and entities. They went after the Trump Organization, Trump employees, the Trump presidential campaign, the Trump transition team, the Trump inauguration committee, the Trump White House and blood members of the Trump clan. The intent of the sweeping oversight offensive designed to encircle the President, launched by Rep. Jerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who\u2019s the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is clear. Democrats are eyeing a case that Trump is not fit to continue in his job. \u201cOur goal is to hold the administration accountable for the obstruction of justice, the abuse of power and the corruption,\u201d Nadler said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on Monday. \u201cOur goal is to protect the rule of law in this country. We have to find out what is going on and we have to lay out a case to the American people and we have to reveal it.\u201d While Democrats are convinced they can make a case that denigrates Trump, it is a measure of the political sensitivity of their quest that they are not willing to talk about their options at the end of it. Whether the eventual remedy for that case is impeachment or the 2020 election, in which voters will be asked to reject what Democrats already brand a historically corrupt presidency, is a decision for down the road. \u201cThis is not a pre-impeachment hearing,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cIf we are going to do anything, we have to have proof.\u201d It\u2019s basic politics for Democrats not to call their investigations an impeachment drive right now. To do so would hand the GOP a gift as it claims the fix is already in \u2013 a case some Republicans are making, as well as arguing that Democrats are trying to reverse a presidential election and that the constant investigations are a classic case of congressional overreach. \u201c(They are) going into every part of his life now. In America, we investigate crimes. We don\u2019t investigate people,\u201d said Rob Astorino, a prominent Trump supporter, Monday night on CNN. To defuse such claims, the Democratic line is that the majority is simply fulfilling a duty to check a norm-busting President. \u201cTo do anything less would be delinquent in our duties to exercise our oversight,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday. Perhaps Democrats will not turn up offenses by Trump that would meet the constitutional impeachment threshold of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Or Democratic leaders, sensing the Republican Party will never ditch its President, could conclude that a foiled effort to oust Trump in a Senate trial could harm their political prospects more than his in 2020. But the shadow of a potential impeachment process will never pass, given Nadler\u2019s use of terms like \u201cabuse of power\u201d and \u201cobstruction\u201d \u2013 offenses for which presidents have faced impeachment inquiries twice within the last 50 years. And Nadler, as chair of the Judiciary Committee, would preside over any eventual impeachment proceedings \u2013 which would likely be based on evidence that his investigators are now seeking to unearth. In the short term, Monday\u2019s move was yet another sign that even when special counsel Robert Mueller files his report and even if other civil and criminal prosecutions into Trump\u2019s past and present life and behavior come to nothing, his troubles are not over. The potential offenses Democrats are examining are stunning in their breadth. They include alleged corruption, obstruction of justice, hush money payments to women, supposed collusion with Russia and claims that Trump infringed the Constitution by using his office for personal financial gain. The people who are getting letters asking for documents include Trump\u2019s grown sons, Eric and Donald Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his transition chairman, Tom Barrack, key members of his campaign team like Steve Bannon, and West Wing officials like former chief of staff Reince Priebus. Letters to Trump\u2019s former press secretary Sean Spicer and communications confidante Hope Hicks requested private notes. The committee also sent a letter to Trump\u2019s former gatekeeper in Trump Tower, Rhona Graff. See the more than 80 names receiving House Judiciary Committee letters in its investigation One notable figure not on Monday\u2019s list was Trump\u2019s daughter and White House adviser, Ivanka. Nadler did not explain why, though he told Burnett that it was \u201cquite conceivable\u201d she could be on a future list. The President predicted the expanded Democratic front this past weekend during his wild speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, offering a preview of how he will seek to slip the dragnet. \u201cThey don\u2019t have anything with Russia. There\u2019s no collusion. So now they go and morph into, \u2018Let\u2019s inspect every deal he\u2019s ever done. We\u2019re going to go into his finances. We\u2019re going to check his deals.\u2019 These people are sick,\u201d Trump said. On Monday, he took a more tempered approach when asked how he would respond to Nadler, telling reporters: \u201cI cooperate all the time with everybody.\u201d By Tuesday, however, he was calling prominent Hill Democrats \u201cstone cold CRAZY\u201d on Twitter and decrying their actions against \u201cinnocent people.\u201d The House Judiciary approach is one of an overlapping set of congressional investigations now powering up, also centered in the House Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Intelligence committees. Those three panels, for instance, asked the State Department on Monday for information on Trump\u2019s private meetings and phone calls in his mysterious relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They also want interpreters who took part in the pair\u2019s private chats to be made available for interviews, all but ensuring a showdown with the administration. The oversight offensive launched on Monday brings its own risks and consequences, given the significant raising of the stakes. And there is no guarantee that such a grave constitutional process and its unpredictable political reverberations can be contained by Democratic leaders. If Democrats spend months making Trump\u2019s life a misery and turn up nothing impeachable, they risk handing the President a huge political victory he can tout in his re-election effort. But if they do find evidence that Trump has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d  in attacking core principles of US democracy, they will face an opposite and fateful political choice. If they fail to take the ultimate sanction against Trump through political timidity, they will have to explain why to grass-roots voters who revile him. Nadler said his duty to the rule of law, the Constitution and civil rights would help him decide what to do. \u201cIf protecting that says no impeachment, I will not support impeachment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf protecting that says go a different course, I will go that course.\u201d There are also practical barriers that Democratic investigations will face. An investigation that extracts documents from more than 80 witnesses eventually leads to interviews and new leads, could end up with millions of pages of evidence and take many months. Democrats just took their first baby steps toward impeaching Donald Trump That\u2019s one reason why some observers suspect that Democrats are seeking to pursue a process that badly damages Trump, heaps pressure on his White House and lands in the middle of the 2020 campaign \u2013 but does not include the risky political step of impeachment hearings. Nadler said his list was made up of people and organizations that had already been asked for cooperation by Mueller and other jurisdictions in an effort to avoid contentious court challenges. But the White House and other agencies are certain to slow-walk the requests and make claims of executive privilege, leading to Democratic subpoenas that could further delay the process by initiating long court battles. And Republicans who remember the Bill Clinton impeachment battle 20 years ago are certain to portray Democrats as pursuing a vendetta against the President, in an effort to shore up his political support. There are already GOP claims that the Democrats are launched on an endless investigation in search of a crime in the belief that Mueller will not unearth impeachable offenses in his final report, expected soon. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what the Mueller report says, but Democrats are already hedging their bets,\u201d Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. \u201cAfter recklessly prejudging the President for obstruction, Chairman Nadler is pursuing evidence to back up his conclusion because, as he admits, \u2018we don\u2019t have the facts yet.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s unshakable position among Republican voters, which could mitigate large-scale desertions from his party in any Senate impeachment trial, is legendary. But the potency of the GOP defense has yet to be tested. Almost every day brings a whiff of another scandal or controversy from the Trump White House \u2013 meaning that any proof of wrongdoing found by Democrats could be especially powerful.",

            "article_content": "Robert Mueller\u2019s report could land within days, yet rather than offering definitive answers, his hotly anticipated filing might only ignite a new controversy \u2013 over how much of the special counsel\u2019s conclusions most Americans get to see. Sources told CNN on Wednesday that the Justice Department is preparing for Mueller to report to Attorney General Bill Barr as soon as next week after an investigation that started as an attempt to find out whether Trump campaign members conspired with a Russian election meddling effort. But the big question is how much of what the special counsel concludes \u2013 after an investigation repeatedly blasted as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by the President \u2013 will be made public or even sent to Congress. Whenever it is filed, Mueller\u2019s report will mark a critical point in the Trump presidency, given the gravity of the accusations against his team, and offer the theoretical possibility of conclusive answers about the last White House race. The reclusive former FBI director\u2019s findings could also put the United States on the road to a new and divisive impeachment saga, if he finds collusion with Russia and an attempt by the President to obstruct justice to cover it up. Justice Department preparing for Mueller report as early as next week If there is no case for Trump to answer, Mueller could at least partially lift a cloud that has haunted the White House every day of his presidency, though a flurry of spin-off cases mean the President\u2019s legal exposure is far from over. It will be a fraught political time, since so many Americans have invested so much emotion in the outcome, whether they are liberals who dream of Trump being ousted from power or supporters who buy his claims of a huge \u201choax.\u201d Yet key players in Washington and many Americans beyond, transfixed by the barely believable drama leading up to the final report, at least at first, may be let down. Mueller\u2019s endgame is obscured because no one really knows exactly what he will report and the information that Barr will choose \u2013 or feel compelled \u2013 to share with Congress and the public on a scandal that has polarized the nation. The uncertainty is almost certain to spark a new struggle between Congress, the White House and the Justice Department that could lead to litigation and has every chance of reaching all the way up to the Supreme Court. Mueller\u2019s filing could also herald the reclusive prosecutor\u2019s own exit from the stage \u2013 likely after not speaking to the American people from the beginning to the end of his investigation. That old fashioned reticence, as well as a stellar career in law enforcement, is one reason why Mueller\u2019s conclusions will carry such weight \u2013 whether his report is ultimately critical of the President or leaves him in the clear. The special counsel has run one of the most impenetrable Washington investigations in memory. He has, however, sprinkled clues throughout a growing library of indictments and court memos. While he has yet to openly accuse anyone in Trump\u2019s orbit of colluding with the Russians, Mueller has laid out 10 criminal cases, seen four people sentenced to prison, secured one conviction at trial, extracted seven guilty pleas and charged 37 people and entities with crimes. He\u2019s put Trump\u2019s campaign chairman Paul Manafort behind bars for witness tampering. The President\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen \u2013 who cooperated with the Mueller investigation \u2013 will also soon go to prison. Clinton, Nixon reports offer starkly different models for Mueller Ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2013 another Trump associate who flipped \u2013 is awaiting sentencing. In richly detailed indictments, Mueller has weaved a tale of Kremlin troll farms, social media campaigns, spear phishing operations and computer hacking. He\u2019s uncovered a pattern of compulsive lying by people close to Trump, often about contacts with Russians, which have raised the key question: What are all of these presidential associates trying to hide? In one of the most tantalizing unclosed loops, Mueller in recent filings revealed that a senior campaign official was directed by an unnamed person to ask Trump\u2019s longtime political adviser Roger Stone about future releases by Wikileaks that could damage Hillary Clinton. Last week, prosecutors said for the first time they had evidence that Stone \u2013 who is charged with obstruction and witness tampering \u2013 communicated with Wikileaks, which many US analysts believe has links to Russian intelligence. According to Justice Department regulations, Mueller is required to file a confidential report with Barr. It is not clear what form it could take. One model would be for the special counsel to adopt a traditional, sparse prosecutorial approach to explain the cases he initiated and decisions he made not to charge other people linked to the case. Barr and Mueller will likely seek to avoid the political furor whipped up by former FBI Director James Comey when he announced he would not charge Clinton after an investigation into her email server but hardily criticized her conduct all the same. According to the regulations governing his appointment, Mueller is only required to deliver a confidential report to the attorney general outlining why he decided to prosecute some people and declined to pursue others. Still, a pared down approach would risk coming across as deeply insufficient given the huge political ramifications of the Mueller investigation, which after all, at least indirectly centers of the behavior of a sitting President. Given his by-the-book history, it\u2019s likely that Mueller would follow the prevailing Justice Department opinion that a sitting President cannot be charged in a criminal case, even if he has evidence that Trump transgressed in some way. So he could choose to include information about Trump\u2019s conduct in his report that he believes should be sent to Congress \u2013 the sole constitutional authority for judging presidential wrongdoing. But since so much of Mueller\u2019s work is a mystery, no one outside his tight operation can say for sure exactly what he might do. Once Mueller files, the focus shifts to Barr, who will come under immediate pressure from Democrats in Congress to allow maximum public access to the special counsel\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThe attorney general, as I understand the rules, would report to Congress about the conclusion of the investigation,\u201d Barr said in his Senate confirmation hearing last month. \u201cI believe there may be discretion there about what the attorney general can put in that report,\u201d he said. His comments prompted concern among Democrats and raised the possibility that, at least initially, the evidence and reasoning that led to Mueller\u2019s final conclusions may be kept under wraps. \u201cI think the American people deserve to know the truth. As Thomas Jefferson used to say, \u2018if the people know the truth, they won\u2019t make a mistake,\u2019\u201d Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, told CNN on Wednesday. Barr could be constrained in his report by the need to respect grand jury secrecy rules, a desire to protect classified material and sources and methods and the reputations of people interviewed by prosecutors and not charged. Trump\u2019s lawyers have already indicated they may seek to have parts of the report withheld through assertions of executive privilege. Such comments have provoked fears that there could be an effort by the administration to use legitimate legal considerations to withhold information that could be damaging to the President. Democrats, especially Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, are preparing to act if there is any such blocking maneuver. Barr also knows there will be strong desire among the public to release details about an investigation that has overshadowed Washington politics and the result of the 2016 election for two years and cost millions of dollars. On the flip side, Barr will be under fearsome pressure from Trump, who has turned on senior law enforcement officials who he feels have offered him insufficient protection. House Democrats have subpoena power that they may use either to try to force the release of Mueller\u2019s full report, or get evidence and testimony uncovered by the special counsel and not released to Congress. All of this could set the stage for a massive legal battle and yet another clash between the executive and legislative branches of the US government. \u201cBarr isn\u2019t going to have the final say here,\u201d said Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency attorney who is now a CNN legal analyst. \u201cIf he tries to withhold even one word of the Mueller report from Congress, they are going to litigate this question to the absolute end of the earth,\u201d Hennessey told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cThey are really, really going to push the executive privilege issues. It is almost certainly going to wind up in the United States Supreme Court,\u201d she said. Just because Mueller may be finishing up, it does not mean the end of Trump\u2019s legal exposure \u2013 nowhere close. To begin with, elements of Mueller\u2019s report and evidence and source information he uncovered could provide fuel for an accelerating Democratic investigation into Trump\u2019s links with Russia. At some point, Democratic leaders may face a choice, if Mueller and Barr indicate that there was wrongdoing by Trump, whether to initiate impeachment proceedings with all the nightmare political consequences that such a step would entail. Mueller\u2019s team has farmed out various cases, not seen under his direct jurisdiction, to prosecutors elsewhere, including in New York. The President\u2019s campaign, transition and administration are currently the subject of a string of civil and criminal legal probes. Many analysts believe that investigations being pursued by the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York that are now delving deep into Trump\u2019s business empire could ultimately prove the most damaging legal threat to the President. That means the final shots of the Mueller investigation may only be the end of the beginning of the legal and political nightmare the President will endure.

            "article_content": "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand entered the 2020 presidential race on Tuesday, telling Stephen Colbert that she was forming an exploratory committee just days before she heads to the critical state of Iowa. \u201cI am filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States tonight,\u201d the New York Democrat said, adding that she is \u201cgoing to run for president of the United States because as young mom I am going to fight for other people\u2019s kids as hard as I will fight for my own, which is why I believe health care should be a right, not a privilege. It is why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn\u2019t matter what block you grow up on. And I believe anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.\u201d Shortly after taping the show, Gillibrand officially filed with the Federal Election Commission and released her first campaign video, which highlighted her work on the 9/11 health bill, women\u2019s rights and fighting President Donald Trump. \u201cI am not afraid of him,\u201d Gillibrand said of the President. The video opens by showing someone Googling the name \u201cKristen\u201d \u2013 not \u201cKirsten\u201d \u2013 a mistake often made regarding the New York senator. Gillibrand, who was elected for her second full term in the Senate in 2018, rose to national prominence in recent years as a forceful proponent of the #MeToo movement and fierce critic of Trump. People close to Gillibrand have indicated the senator will run a campaign centered on gender issues, something she has championed in the House and Senate. In her interview with Colbert, Gillibrand added, \u201cYou are never going to accomplish any of these things if you don\u2019t take on the systems of power that make all of that impossible, which is taking on institutional racism, it is taking on the corruption and greed in Washington, taking on the special interests that write legislation in the dead of night. And I know that I have the compassion, the courage and the fearless determination to get that done.\u201d CNN reported earlier on Tuesday that Gillibrand intended to make her announcement to Colbert and had informed key supporters of her plans. Although Gillibrand is forming an exploratory committee \u2013 something politicians often do to get more information on whether to run \u2013 Gillibrand told Colbert that there was no chance she wouldn\u2019t run. \u201cIt\u2019s an important first step and it\u2019s one that I\u2019m taking because I\u2019m going to run,\u201d she said. While it is certain that Gillibrand\u2019s focus on Trump will continue during her campaign, the New York Democrat will have to get through a sizable field of Democrats considering a run for President, including a handful of her colleagues in the Senate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced an exploratory committee last month and has traveled to Iowa and New Hampshire, while California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and others are publicly considering a bid. Gillibrand charts trip to Iowa, making 2020 run look imminent Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Richard Ojeda, a failed West Virginia congressional candidate, have all announced bids for the Democratic nomination. A spokesperson for Gillibrand declined to comment on her plans. Ahead of her trip to Iowa this weekend, Gillibrand has been calling top Iowa Democrats to pick up advice and discuss her upcoming trip, multiple sources in the state tell CNN. Among them is Troy Price, the chair of the Iowa Democratic Party. Price told CNN that he urged the New York Democrat to begin \u201claying the ground work\u201d in the state and \u201cshow that she is ready to get to know people here.\u201d \u201cVoters are ready to get to know her,\u201d Price told CNN of Gillibrand. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s important for anyone who comes through to start thinking about those relationships because a caucus process is one where people want to get to know you\u201d before they support you. Gillibrand has already stacked her campaign with a number of top hires who were speaking with other contenders. Jess Fassler, Gillibrand\u2019s chief of staff, will work as the senator\u2019s campaign manager. Fassler has been with Gillibrand since she was a House member representing upstate New York. Dan McNally, formerly the political director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, will work as Gillibrand\u2019s campaign director. McNally, a longtime Democratic operative who managed Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet\u2019s 2016 campaign, has worked at both the DSCC and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Meredith Kelly, the former communications director for the DCCC, will be the senator\u2019s communications director. And Emmy Bengtson, digital director to Gavin Newsom\u2019s successful California gubernatorial campaign last year and deputy social media director for Hillary Clinton in 2016, will work as Gillibrand\u2019s deputy communications director. Gillibrand, formerly a moderate Democrat in the House of Representatives, has shifted to more liberal positions since being appointed to Clinton\u2019s Senate seat in 2009. She is a vocal critic of Trump and has sparred with him on Twitter, the President\u2019s favorite social media platform. After Gillibrand called for Trump\u2019s resignation after multiple women renewed their sexual misconduct allegations against him, Trump slammed the senator with language that Gillibrand called a \u201csexist smear.\u201d \u201cLightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office \u201cbegging\u201d for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump,\u201d Trump tweeted in December 2017. Gillibrand responded by calling the tweet a \u201ca sexist smear intended to silence me.\u201d Gillibrand enters the 2020 field with $10.5 million in the bank, a sizable war chest that would make her one of the most financially formidable candidates. While her most recent Senate run helped replenish her campaign coffers, it also provided opponents with a potential attack and a question Gillibrand has to answer: She promised voters in 2018 to serve her full term. \u201cI will serve my six-year term,\u201d she said during a Senate debate when asked about her 2020 plans. In 2017, Gillibrand ran afoul of some powerful Democratic donors after leading calls urging Minnesota Democrat Al Franken to resign from the Senate. Franken quit following allegations \u2013 one of which included photographic evidence \u2013 that he touched women inappropriately. Some donors believed Franken, a popular lawmaker, was pushed out of office too quickly and could have weathered the controversy. Addressing the criticism, Gillibrand told CNN\u2019s Van Jones in December: \u201cSometimes you just have to do what\u2019s right, even if it\u2019s painful \u2026 if I can\u2019t protect the women in my workspace, if I can\u2019t \u2014 not only stand up for women who feel abused, or feel harassed in our workplace \u2014 then I\u2019m not doing my job, and so I just got to a point where enough was enough.\u201d Around the same time that she came out against Franken, Gillibrand also said that in hindsight, former President Bill Clinton should have resigned because of his affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \u201cThings have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction,\u201d Gillibrand said in an interview with The New York Times. Asked if he should have resigned, she added, \u201cYes, I think that is the appropriate response.\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told CNN in a statement, \u201cIf you looked up \u2018political opportunism\u2019 in the dictionary, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s photo would be next to it. From jumping on the \u2018abolish ICE\u2019 bandwagon to turning on the Clintons, Gillibrand always goes where the political wind blows. Democrats know it, which is why she\u2019s barely registering in the polls.\u201d CNN\u2019s Athena Jones and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democratic lawmakers are discussing how to make the interpreters in President Donald Trump\u2019s meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin appear before them to learn what transpired amid reports the President has worked to keep the content of his huddles with Putin a secret. House Democrats are acting following a stunning Washington Post report that Trump has taken pains to keep even his own administration officials in the dark about his talks with Putin, taking away his interpreter\u2019s notes on at least one occasion and demanding that no information about the talks be shared with US officials. CNN has confirmed that after a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, Trump took the interpreter\u2019s notes and told him not to share anything about the discussion with anyone else, according to a former State Department official who was in Hamburg when the meeting took place. Senior White House and State officials who work on Russian issues asked for notes on the meeting and did not get them, the source said. Another former State Department official said that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not provide a readout of the meeting to US ambassadors in the region. The source said that \u201cTillerson played stuff pretty close to his chest\u201d with all meetings and this one was no different. The unusual level of secrecy from the President, which aides have attributed to his desire to avoid leaks, stands apart from his behavior with other world leaders. The reports come on the heels of a New York Times article that the FBI began investigating whether Trump was working on behalf of Russian interests after his May 2017 firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was then leading the probe into Russia interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. That probe, now led by special counsel Robert Mueller, has resulted in criminal charges against 36 people and entities and guilty pleas from seven people. Four of those people, including two Trump associates, were sentenced to prison and the rest are awaiting sentencing. Questions about the ties between Trump, members of his campaign and Russia are coming under more intense scrutiny as Democrats now control the House. And Democrats have set their sights on the President\u2019s interpreters. Rep. Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat who\u2019s the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN his panel will work with the House Intelligence Committee to get the interpreter\u2019s notes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Engel said on \u201cAt This Hour\u201d with Kate Bolduan, adding that \u201cno decisions have been made on subpoenas.\u201d As part of that effort, Engel\u2019s committee and the House intelligence panel were meeting Monday to discuss how to subpoena the interpreter\u2019s records from a Trump-Putin meeting in July in Helsinki, Finland. The leaders met for close to two hours with only interpreters present. Little is known about their discussions and few, if any, administration officials were briefed on the details. One of the former State Department officials told CNN that Trump\u2019s meetings with other European leaders were \u201ctotally different\u201d in terms of protocol. \u201cStandard procedure was the standard procedure,\u201d the source said, citing Trump\u2019s first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in March 2017. The US charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires from the embassy in Berlin came to the meeting in Washington and notes from the meeting were shared through regular channels. Two Democratic aides told CNN there is some hesitation about pursuing this course. There are concerns about crimping future diplomatic conversations if leaders think they can\u2019t speak freely because their interpreters\u2019 notes could be made public. And interpreters may be legally protected from having to testify. If House Democrats move forward with a subpoena, Senate Democrats would like to support the effort, the aides said, but it is not yet clear exactly how they would do that. The Washington Post report said US officials have no detailed record, even in classified form, of five meetings Trump has had with Putin over two years, despite the fact that US intelligence agencies believe Moscow wanted Trump to win the election and conducted an unprecedented level of campaign interference to support that outcome. It\u2019s unclear how many conversations Trump and Putin have had by phone, as the White House stopped reading out the President\u2019s calls with foreign leaders almost a year ago. \u201cWe all know that the Russians interfered in our 2016 election,\u201d Engel told CNN. \u201cWe know they interfered to try to help Donald Trump win. And since that time, there have been meetings between Putin and Trump and we don\u2019t know what went on \u2026 You just scratch your head and say, \u2018What is it? Why is it that the President of the United States seems to go against our allies like the UK or Germany or France and cozy up to Putin?\u2019 It makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d Regardless, Engel promised in a statement that his committee \u201cwill be holding hearings on the mysteries swirling around Trump\u2019s bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security.\u201d Translators aren\u2019t meant to be pulled into the public fray. They are not confirmed officials or policy makers, and they don\u2019t serve the same function as a transcriber or official note taker, the aide who sits alongside a president, secretary of state or other Cabinet official and records what happened, what promises and requests were made. Nevertheless, Engel\u2019s counterpart on the intelligence panel, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, indicated in a tweet that Democrats would be trying again to have Trump\u2019s interpreters testify and that they\u2019d put public pressure on Republicans to support the move. Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter\u2019s notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin. The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now? Shouldn\u2019t we find out whether our president is really putting \u201cAmerica first?\u201d https://t.co/hzgfTRl653 \u201cLast year, we sought to obtain the interpreter\u2019s notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin,\u201d Schiff tweeted, referring to the July summit in Helsinki. \u201cThe Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now? Shouldn\u2019t we find out whether our president is really putting America first?\u2019 \u201c On Monday, Schiff told CNN that \u201cIf the Washington Post report is accurate \u2013 and the only written memorialization of what happened in that meeting is in Russian hands because the American copy \u2026 has been destroyed, that\u2019s a pretty terrible risk we are running not knowing what happened in a private meeting. We are looking at our remedies but we haven\u2019t made a decision yet. Chairman Engel and I are conferring. \u201c On Saturday, Trump dismissed the Washington Post report. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping anything under wraps,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. I mean, it\u2019s so ridiculous. These people make it up.\u201d Trump: I never worked for Russia Trump\u2019s appearance with Putin in Helsinki met scathing bipartisan criticism after he sided with the Russian leader over US intelligence services\u2019 findings that Russia had interefered in the 2016 election. Afterward, he went on to contradict his director of national intelligence and his cyber agencies \u2013 claiming that Russia is no longer targeting the US with cyberattacks \u2013 made comments that undercut NATO and echoed Russia\u2019s outlook on other issues. That performance led lawmakers to call for Marina Gross, the State Department interpreter who shepherded Trump through the Helsinki meeting, to appear before Congress. According to the Post, Trump has used more than one interpreter for his various meetings with Putin. Gross, a State Department employee with years of experience translating at the highest levels, is known within the department as a longtime, respected civil servant. She has been photographed alongside former first lady Laura Bush. Gross also sat alongside Tillerson during his April 2017 visit to Moscow. Gross might have notes of her meeting, but they would be meant to help her translate simultaneously and not to maintain a record of Trump\u2019s exchanges with Putin, according to other interpreters. It is highly unusual for lawmakers to consider asking a translator to appear, let alone one who has been working with a president. There\u2019s also the question of whether what the translator heard is covered by executive privilege, which allows the president to fight requests by Congress or the courts for information. Engel acknowledged the question of executive privilege, telling CNN that \u201cI would like, in a perfect world, not to look at what an interpreter wrote. I would prefer not to do that. We have to see what we can find out. If I had a choice, I would rather not do that with the interpreter.\u201d But he added, \u201cWe may have no choice.\u201d Gamal Helal, an Arabic interpreter and senior adviser to four presidents and seven secretaries of state, told CNN in July that, at least in his memory, there is no precedent for Congress to order a translator to appear. There have been several instances where translators have been subpoenaed in legal cases, he said, and the State Department, which provides translation services for the entire government, and Justice Department have protected them from testifying. Often it is a condition of them taking the job, Helal said. \u201cIt would be a horrible precedent if a president wasn\u2019t free to talk one-on-one with a head of state,\u201d Helal said. \u201cThe principal uses the interpreter to communicate,\u201d Helal told CNN. \u201cTherefore the interpreter is an extension of the principal. If you want to know what the principal says, in this case the President, you have to ask him.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eli Watkins and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As special counsel Robert Mueller wraps up his Russia probe, investigators have focused on conflicting public statements by President Donald Trump and his team that could be seen as an effort to influence witnesses and obstruct justice, according to people familiar with the investigation. The line of questioning adds to indications that Mueller views false or misleading statements to the press or to the public as obstruction of justice. That could set up a potential flashpoint with the White House and the Trump legal team should that become part of any final report from the Mueller investigation. Mueller hasn\u2019t addressed the issue publicly, but prosecutors have dropped hints that they view public statements as possibly key in influencing witnesses. Court filings from the plea of Michael Cohen, the President\u2019s former personal lawyer, included allegations related to false public statements \u2013 not usually considered illegal since they aren\u2019t made directly to investigators. A December sentencing memo filed by Mueller\u2019s office notes that Cohen\u2019s lies were amplified in public statements, \u201cincluding to other potential witnesses.\u201d The memo said this was done partly \u201cin the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election \u2013 an issue of heightened national interest.\u201d The President\u2019s legal team took notice of the Cohen plea documents and believe the special counsel is pursuing a thin legal theory when it comes to potentially criminalizing public statements, a source briefed on the matter said. They believe the President\u2019s comments are protected under the First Amendment and that there\u2019s a difference between a plea deal and the President\u2019s position, which is to fight the allegations. In a tweet Thursday night, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani slammed the special counsel\u2019s team. \u201cRead CNN article that (Mueller) wants to use the President\u2019s public comments as part of an obstruction claim. According to this latest oppressive legal theory you can\u2019t even defend yourself,\u201d Giuliani said. Whenever Mueller\u2019s investigation concludes, the moment is expected to mark the beginning of a new political and legal fight over the probe\u2019s findings. One of those key areas of dispute likely will center on obstruction of justice allegations, which the President\u2019s legal team has considered off-limits because they argue it pertains to matters covered under executive privilege. When Trump responded to written questions from Mueller before Thanksgiving, the President\u2019s lawyers refused to respond to any questions on obstruction. While Mueller is widely expected to not try to bring charges against the President, following long-standing Justice Department legal guidelines, investigators could try to weave into their report examples of how the President used public statements to try to obstruct the investigation. The Mueller team\u2019s questioning also shows their interest in obstruction extends beyond the President\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey One witness who worked closely with Trump told CNN that, based on the questions asked, it is clear Mueller is looking at the President\u2019s \u201cchanging stories\u201d as a way to possibly show corrupt intent in the obstruction probe. Prosecutors appear to be examining the President\u2019s public statements as well to determine whether there\u2019s an effort to try to influence other witnesses and cause other administration and former campaign officials to make false public statements. That includes the President\u2019s role in crafting the misleading Air Force One statement in the summer of 2017 on the now infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians attended by Donald Trump Jr., the President\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Another episode centers on Trump\u2019s attempt to have his then-White House counsel Don McGahn disavow articles reporting that McGahn threatened to quit over Trump\u2019s pressure to fire Mueller, according to one source familiar with the matter. McGahn refused to publicly say that the stories were false, which prompted more anger from the President. The President publicly has said he wouldn\u2019t fire Mueller and hadn\u2019t thought about it, which other witnesses have told Mueller\u2019s investigators isn\u2019t true. Meanwhile, as clues mount that Mueller is ending his multi-year investigation in the coming weeks, new political and legal fights are emerging over who will actually be able to read his findings. It\u2019s a battle the White House and Congress are already preparing for to determine if any of the report Mueller produces goes to Congress or any part of it becomes public. President Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t indicate Thursday whether he wants Mueller\u2019s final report to be made public, saying to reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see.\u201d But behind the scenes at the White House, an intense effort is underway to keep a lot of what Mueller submits private. The new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, has been beefing up his staff to deal with this fight, hiring 17 new lawyers including three deputy counsels, a senior administration official said. More could be hired. Mueller\u2019s investigators have been reviewing more than a million pages of documents that the President and the White House legal team voluntarily turned over without waiving privilege. Trump\u2019s legal team and Cipollone believe that a large portion of the information in Mueller\u2019s investigation should be protected by executive privilege. The Trump lawyers envision a heavily redacted version of the report to perhaps become public. For a year, the Trump lawyers and the Mueller team have held on-and-off discussions for a possible interview with Trump, though the President has been counseled not to talk. His lawyers have told the special counsel they will not agree to an in-person interview, the president\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN on Wednesday. But the President agreed to answer a limited set of questions in writing regarding matters that occurred before the 2016 election. Those responses were submitted before Thanksgiving. While Mueller indicated there were some follow-up questions, Trump\u2019s lawyers resisted and demanded to know which areas would need additional questions, Giuliani told CNN. Another source familiar with the discussion said the special counsel has been told that the President won\u2019t answer any more questions. The special counsel\u2019s office has not responded and there has been no discussion between the two sides since before Christmas, Giuliani said. Even as the investigation continues, the Mueller team has already begun writing parts of the report laying out the investigation\u2019s findings, sources familiar with the matter said. One person who knows Mueller and soon-to-depart Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the expectation is that it will be an extremely detailed written analysis and finalized after the investigative work is concluded. This person said both Mueller and Rosenstein are proponents of a written work product, leading to the belief it will be a thorough report. But the final product is unlikely to fall on Rosenstein\u2019s desk. If confirmed, Bill Barr, the President\u2019s pick for attorney general, will oversee the investigation and ultimately decide what happens to the report. The Justice Department regulations governing the special counsel calls for Mueller to \u201cprovide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel\u201d when his work is completed. The special counsel\u2019s report is expected to answer a number questions that follow Rosenstein\u2019s order appointing him, including whether anyone in the Trump campaign illegally coordinated with Russians who interfered in the 2016 elections. But investigators have also sought, through interviews and documents, to determine: whether Trump obstructed justice; whether Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians in June 2016; whether campaign contacts sought stolen Democratic Party emails; whether foreign money illegally came into the election; and what gave rise to the Republican Party changing its platform in 2016 on Russian intervention in Ukraine. The regulations don\u2019t require Mueller to share his findings with the public. If Mueller and the Justice Department do not make the report public \u2013 and if the White House wants to keep it largely secret \u2013 Congress could issue a subpoena to try to force its release. Democrats, who now control the House of Representatives, have said they will fight to make sure the report is made public. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN recently he\u2019s prepared to do \u201ceverything possible so that the public has the advantage of as much of the information as it can.\u201d \u201cNow, there may be parts of the report that have to be redacted because they involved classified information or they involve grand jury material,\u201d Schiff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union with Jake Tapper\u201d just before Christmas. \u201cAt the end of the day, this case is just too important to keep from the American people what it\u2019s really about.\u201d One of the likely points of contention between Trump and congressional opponents is likely to center on whether the President obstructed justice with some of his actions during the investigation. Trump\u2019s team refused to answer any obstruction-related questions. They\u2019ve argued that this part of the probe goes to the heart of the President\u2019s constitutional responsibilities. That could make any effort by Democrats to focus on that issue more contentious. Trump\u2019s lawyers have even sought to resist answering questions about the transition period \u2013 the period of time between the election and the inauguration \u2013 arguing that it is part of the incoming administration and should also be covered by executive privilege. But Schiff said that the administration has already set a precedent with its cooperation with Republicans in Congress investigating Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton. \u201cFor the last two years, I have been warning the Justice Department, as they have been turning over tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of pages of investigative files in the Clinton e-mail investigation, that whatever precedent they were going to set, they were going to have to live by,\u201d Schiff said.

            "article_content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has left plenty of questions hanging with no answers for almost 20 months. But with the new year, there\u2019s the possibility some of these questions will finally be answered. There are already scheduled hearings and deadlines in former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s criminal cases and a growing expectation of the wind-down of Mueller\u2019s work and use of a federal grand jury. Here are 16 questions about what\u2019s to come in the Russia probe: When he concludes his work, Mueller must provide a confidential report to the attorney general. But before that happens, he could seek additional indictments. So far, Mueller\u2019s team has secured guilty pleas from seven people, including President Donald Trump\u2019s top two campaign leaders, his former personal attorney and his first national security adviser. Twenty-six others, who are all Russian, have been indicted by Mueller. RELATED: Tracking the Russia investigations In theory, the special counsel will answer a cascade of questions raised in the investigation, including whether he believes Trump obstructed justice, and will release findings on the allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mueller will likely assess whether Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians in June 2016, whether campaign contacts sought stolen Democratic Party emails, whether foreign money illegally came into the election and what gave rise to the Republican Party changing its platform on Russian intervention in Ukraine. Whether Mueller\u2019s findings will become public and how is another question entirely \u2013 one that could lead to a fight of its own. If Mueller and the Justice Department do not make the report public \u2013 and if the White House wants to keep it largely secret \u2013 Congress could issue a subpoena to try to force its release. Some details may be held back, because of assertions of executive privilege, grand jury secrecy and other confidentiality considerations. Congress and public interest groups could go to court over what should be released. From almost the beginning, the threat that Trump or the attorney general could fire Mueller has hung over the probe. But Trump hasn\u2019t done it \u2013 yet. Speculation about Mueller\u2019s impending dismissal reached a fever pitch last April, after multiple news organizations, including CNN, reported that Trump was furious over the probe and previously directed his White House counsel to fire the special counsel. Don McGahn, who was then the White House counsel, refused. Now McGahn has left the West Wing, as has chief of staff John Kelly, who presided during much of the time Trump railed against Mueller. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from overseeing the investigation, left the Justice Department in the hands of now-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who disregarded the advice of a Justice Department ethics official and did not recuse from the probe. The next boss in line to oversee Mueller is Bill Barr, who was attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration and is again nominated to be attorney general. Barr\u2019s approach to Mueller is yet to be seen. Previously, he wasn\u2019t completely supportive of the investigation. He wrote a memo to Justice Department officials in June arguing that an obstruction of justice inquiry into Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey was \u201cfatally misconceived.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Mueller has more questions for Trump. The President\u2019s team has signaled for months that it would fight if he were asked to testify under subpoena or sit for an interview with Mueller, two situations where lying can be prosecuted as a federal crime. Instead, the President\u2019s defense team held off a court fight by responding in writing to a set of questions from Mueller just before Thanksgiving. They dealt largely with the allegations of Russian collusion and the time period before the inauguration. But Mueller\u2019s team has always been interested in interviewing the President, and the two sides have been in communication as of last month. If Mueller did send Trump a subpoena for grand jury testimony, historical legal precedent suggests Trump would have to answer questions under oath. Trump was the chief critic of Mueller in the second half of 2018, calling the investigation a politically motivated witch hunt repeatedly and at a frantic pace. \u201cThe Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics,\u201d Trump tweeted on December 29. The grand jury used by Mueller to indict Manafort, his deputy Rick Gates and 26 Russians over the past year and a half first assembled in the Washington federal courthouse in the summer of 2017. Its initial 18-month term was extended by up to six months on Friday. Mueller grand jury extended for up to 6 months The grand jury has convened on most Fridays, receiving scores of witnesses who gave testimony and hours of findings from prosecutors about the intricacies of Russian attempts to infiltrate US politics. This secret body of no more than 23 citizens is a powerful tool Mueller can use to compel evidence collection and bring in witnesses. It\u2019s also the panel of peers that ultimately votes to approve criminal indictments. Apparently, it\u2019s still doing its work. The grand jury last gathered on December 21, according to CNN reporting. Mueller also has the option to present evidence to other established grand juries, such as the one in Virginia he used to open a second case against Manafort. Beyond Mueller, a new class of investigators was sworn in this week: House Democrats. Democrats now control the key House committees that can investigate Trump\u2019s campaign ties to Russia, his personal finances, obstruction of justice and just about everything in between. These committees have subpoena power and can force key witnesses to turn over sensitive documents, and can demand that Trump\u2019s closest allies appear for public hearings to face blistering questions in front of the cameras. Senior Democrats have said they won\u2019t wait for Mueller to complete his probe before launching their own investigations. Though some staunch liberals are clamoring for impeachment, Democratic leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say that won\u2019t be on the table until Mueller closes shop. Even if Mueller does wrap up his work in 2019, Democrats are sure to keep up the pressure with their aggressive moves on the Hill. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not yet ruled on Stone associate Andrew Miller\u2019s attempt to dodge a subpoena and his challenge of Mueller\u2019s authority. Miller lost his case before a trial-level judge and was held in contempt of court, then appealed. If he wins, the court could undercut Mueller\u2019s appointment within the Justice Department. But if the appeals court sticks with the trial judge\u2019s findings and Miller still refuses to testify, he could go to jail. Miller is one of 13 known Stone associates who\u2019ve been approached by investigators. A second grand jury subpoena challenge related to the Mueller investigation has worked its way to the Supreme Court in recent weeks. That challenge, from an unnamed foreign-government-owned company, is fending off mounting fees for failing to turn over information to the grand jury. As of Friday afternoon, the Supreme Court was still considering whether to freeze the fine. Last we heard from Gates, he had testified for three days against Manafort at trial and \u201ccontinues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations,\u201d his defense lawyer and Mueller\u2019s prosecutors said in November. It\u2019s notable that prosecutors\u2019 status report on Gates hasn\u2019t hinted at a coming sentencing, given prosecutors\u2019 successful convictions of Manafort. What else could the top Trump campaign and inaugural official be helping Mueller and the Justice Department with? The next status report from prosecutors and Gates\u2019 legal team is scheduled to be submitted to the court on January 15. The Russian company Concord Management and Consulting is fighting this battle in court, as it fends off a criminal indictment for allegedly funding a social media conspiracy to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Concord has taken a scrappy, antagonistic approach to Mueller\u2019s allegations in court. Concord was the only Russian company or person out of 15 total to fight the propaganda charges \u2013 it pleaded not guilty and the oligarch who owns the company has lambasted the allegations as a joke. The company previously lost in its requests for the court to invalidate Mueller\u2019s indictment and authority. Now, its request to access and to share \u201csensitive\u201d evidence in the case among Russians gets to what prosecutors believe is the heart of its strategy. Prosecutors say it\u2019s particularly risky for Concord to get evidence in the case because of its ties to indicted and sanctioned Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin. The judge has yet to decide. Over and over again, one name \u2013 Konstantin Kilimnik \u2013 has been connected to several parts of the Mueller investigation. Could Kilimnik be at the heart of Mueller\u2019s pursuit? Kilimnik surfaced first last year in the case against Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, when Mueller\u2019s team admitted it cared about how van der Zwaan had connected with Kilimnik and Gates in fall 2016. They also said Gates knew Kilimnik worked for the Russian military intelligence agency, GRU, which Mueller alleges hacked the Democrats in 2016. Most recently, Mueller\u2019s team acknowledged it had asked Manafort several things about Kilimnik and their meetings, and it said Manafort had lied to the prosecutors about his contact with his longtime foreign colleague. Though the Justice Department has not said it yet publicly, Kilimnik met with Manafort twice during the Trump campaign and helped Manafort offer a Russian oligarch briefings on the election, according to reports from other news organizations and Manafort\u2019s and Kilimnik\u2019s public statements. Another cooperator in the Mueller investigation, lobbyist W. Samuel Patten, also had contact with Kilimnik through 2017, as they secured tickets to the Trump inauguration for a paying Ukrainian oligarch client. Like Gates, Patten\u2019s cooperation with the special counsel\u2019s office has stayed under wraps and apparently continues. Mueller indicted Kilimnik last year for attempting to tamper with potential witnesses in Manafort\u2019s case, and said he had worked with Manafort and Gates to \u201ccarry out the criminal schemes\u201d to which Manafort has admitted. The question remains: What else have they learned about him? Because he lives in Russia, Kilimnik has not yet appeared in US court to enter a plea. He has not publicly responded to the obstruction charges. In interviews, he has denied working for Russian intelligence. A prison sentence is a near certainty. The former Trump campaign chairman and lobbyist will go before federal Judge T.S. Ellis on February 8 for his first sentencing on eight tax and bank fraud convictions. And, following a broken plea deal, Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced by a second judge about a month later for additional crimes, though this date may be pushed back. Before then, the public may learn more about Manafort\u2019s lies to prosecutors during his nine cooperation sessions with Mueller\u2019s office, which began after he pleaded guilty to avoid a second trial. Manafort has lived in jail since June, when prosecutors accused him of attempted witness tampering. The possibility that prosecutors would ask for leniency for Manafort has evaporated. The mounting convictions set Manafort up for a decade or more of prison time. His prospects look bleak. However, Manafort has one Hail Mary he can still pray for: a pardon from the President. This is what special counsel office prosecutor Jeannie Rhee said at Michael Cohen\u2019s criminal sentencing in December: \u201cHe has provided our office with credible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues under investigation and within the purview of the special counsel\u2019s office.\u201d What could those \u201ccore Russia-related issues\u201d be? It\u2019s not yet clear whether Cohen\u2019s assistance will boost other threads of the investigation. Mueller\u2019s team said in an earlier court filing that Cohen spoke to investigators about communication efforts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016 and about his contact with White House officials in 2017 and 2018. They also indicated that Cohen was in touch with White House staff and Trump\u2019s lawyers while he prepared a written false statement to Congress, for which he was criminally charged. The Justice Department instructions for Mueller\u2019s investigation put the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election at its core. The Ecuadorian government has signaled unhappiness with its guest of almost seven years at its London embassy \u2013 setting up a will-it-or-won\u2019t-it scenario that could force Assange into US authorities\u2019 custody. Assange originally stepped inside the embassy in 2012 while wanted for questions over sexual assault allegations in Sweden. He\u2019s maintained his innocence, and since then has become a focus in Mueller\u2019s investigation of the Russian hack and public distribution of the Hillary Clinton campaign emails and information from Democratic Party computers in 2016. Justice Department investigations of Assange and his outlet WikiLeaks date to at least 2010, when the site posted files from former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Recently, US prosecutors \u2013 in an apparent slip-up \u2013 mentioned in a court document that Assange has been charged in a still-secret federal court case. It\u2019s not yet known what he\u2019s been charged with, or if the case relates to Mueller\u2019s investigation at all. Several signs for months now have pointed toward a grand jury investigation into Roger Stone\u2019s alleged pursuit of stolen Clinton and Democratic documents and his alleged communications with WikiLeaks. That Mueller has called upon Stone associates for information, documents and grand jury testimony is the most obvious part. The Mueller team also mentioned an unnamed person \u2013 believed to be Stone \u2013 in describing Russian hackers\u2019 contacts with Americans around the time they were releasing damaging Democratic emails in 2016. Stone bragged about close ties with Assange during the 2016 campaign but then revised his story and said he was just repeating publicly available information. The fullest account of Stone\u2019s actions in 2016 came in draft court filings and text messages Stone associate Jerome Corsi shared with CNN in November. Corsi says Mueller presented him with the option to plead guilty to a lying charge, but he rejected the deal. The draft filings from November describe how Stone allegedly pushed his associates to get stolen Democratic documents from WikiLeaks before they went public. Two weeks ago, the House Intelligence Committee agreed to send Mueller transcripts of a 2017 closed-door interview with Stone, indicating his statements to Congress about the Russia investigations are at the heart of the special counsel\u2019s interest. Stone has not been publicly charged with a crime. He has said he believes he will be indicted, and he has asked his online supporters to help his legal defense. In one of the more dramatic courtroom moments of 2018, Michael Flynn was encouraged by a federal judge to delay his sentencing and cooperate further with the government. Mueller\u2019s office had asked for no jail time for the former national security adviser after he provided the Justice Department with \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d in investigations, yet federal Judge Emmet Sullivan was clearly incensed that the former high-ranking military and intelligence leader had lied to the FBI in his first days in the Trump administration. Will Flynn ultimately go to prison, like the four Mueller defendants who have already been sentenced? And is there more he can do to help the Justice Department and Mueller\u2019s team before he appears before Sullivan again? His next in-court update is due on paper in mid-March. For all of the above topics, the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. President Donald Trump says his phone call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cabsolutely perfect.\u201d He says asking China and other countries to investigate his political opponent Joe Biden is also perfectly fine. Rather than contest the facts Democrats are assembling in their impeachment inquiry, he\u2019s essentially conceding many of them \u2013 and daring Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s team to convince America that the evidence really amounts to a case for removing him from office. The President is putting all his chips on the table. \u201cTrump is betting that Americans will become so accustomed to his transgressions that they will become immune to outrage; that they will inoculate him against impeachment,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. His invitation to China to investigate Biden was an even worse offense than asking Ukraine, she added. \u201cThis time, Trump was asking not a friendly country, but a top geopolitical foe of the United States to interfere in America\u2019s elections, an even more jaw-dropping affront to the responsible conduct of US foreign policy,\u201d Ghitis wrote. (For the latest updates on the impeachment battle, sign up for CNN\u2019s new Impeachment Tracker Newsletter.) Almost everything Trump is doing goes against the advice offered by Paul Begala, who helped President Bill Clinton win his impeachment fight: \u201cThe more Trump talks, the more he confesses, covers up, opens new areas of inquiry, or pulls the rug out from under his previous defense.\u201d What should Trump be doing? \u201cFocus on the American people\u2019s problems, not yours\u2026Clinton told the country he was getting up every morning and working on their problems. And he was. Even with a GOP House that was impeaching him, and a GOP Senate, he passed legislation to double Head Start.\u201d Trump argues he has an absolute right to urge other countries to investigate \u201ccorruption.\u201d But, of course, it is his focus on Biden \u2013 without any actual evidence of corruption \u2013 that is the flashpoint. Four historians delivered a verdict: \u201cIn the history of American foreign relations, we are unaware of any prior case \u2014 in 230 years \u2014 of a president asking a foreign leader to intervene in American domestic politics,\u201d something Trump has now done multiple times. \u201cNo one knows if Congress will decide that these actions rise to the level of impeachable \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors.\u2019 We do know history will judge them harshly, because Donald Trump is not fulfilling the most solemn duty of every president: to protect the nation\u2019s security.\u201d In the New York Post, Rich Lowry wrote that there\u2019s nothing wrong with Trump asking foreign leaders such as Australia\u2019s prime minister to cooperate with Attorney General William Barr\u2019s investigation of the Russia probe\u2019s beginnings. \u201cThe Russian story \u2026 offered Democrats the hope of deliverance from a president whose election they never truly accepted,\u201d Lowry wrote. \u201cWhen Robert Mueller didn\u2019t have the goods, House Democrats were at sea for a while, until Trump\u2019s call and the whistleblower complaint brought impeachment deliciously back into play. Ukraine is more an epilogue of the Russian investigation than the beginning of a new book.\u201d Defenders of Trump might write off the impeachment inquiry as another seemingly existential threat to the real estate tycoon that he will manage to dodge, wrote Sarah Isgur. Early polls, though, have bad news for Trump. \u201cRepublican voters aren\u2019t as quick to dismiss the whistleblower\u2019s allegations as they were to move on from the Mueller Report or the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape,\u201d she wrote. Harry Enten noted, \u201cAmericans are more eager to impeach Trump now than they were at similar points in the impeachment sagas of Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\u201d The Watergate scandal blew wide open in 1973 when White House counsel John Dean revealed Nixon\u2019s effort to cover up the facts. After a stream of death threats against Dean, the Justice Department provided US marshals to protect him for 18 months.  \u201cThose marshals were consummate professionals, and I am sure their successors are, too,\u201d Dean wrote for CNN Opinion. Now the same needs to be done for the whistleblower in the Trump impeachment inquiry, he said: \u201cIt is difficult to imagine a more important federal witness than one who testifies in an impeachment proceeding. That witness needs to be protected.\u201d The whistleblower has become a target for Trump and his allies, wrote Elie Honig, \u201cTrump has claimed that the person or people who gave information to the whistleblower are \u2018close to a spy\u2019 and longingly noted that \u2018in the old days \u2026 we used to handle it a little differently than we do now\u2019 \u2013 referring, not so obliquely, to executing disloyal spies. To be clear: The President of the United States has publicly suggested punishment, up to and including execution, for members of our own intelligence community who provide information about potential wrongdoing through established, lawful channels.\u201d (And Elie is answering your impeachment questions here. ) \u201cThe Rudy Show is a hot ticket,\u201d John Philp wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a mesmerizing, wild-eyed performance that invites an inevitable question: What happened to Rudy?\u201d Philp is well positioned to answer that. He co-wrote and directed the 2003 documentary, \u201cRudyland,\u201d all about  the man who became known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d for a time after 9/11 \u2013 and who now has his fingerprints all over the Ukraine story. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s antics, while striking most decent people as utterly insane, will feel sadly familiar to anybody who\u2019s watched his career closely,\u201d Philp observed. \u201cGiuliani, an opera buff, has made his time on the public stage an endless aria of political pettiness, braying self-aggrandizement and ethical and personal turmoil. Only the settings change.\u201d \u201cThe Rudy we see today, with his showstopping mix of conviction and incoherence, is the same Rudy we\u2019ve always had. The only thing new is his predicament.\u201d Calling him an \u201cinternational man of mystery,\u201d Asha Rangappa said Giuliani may try to duck questions from Congress, saying he is protected by attorney-client privilege. But it might not work: \u201cThe crime-fraud exception states that the attorney-client privilege cannot be used as a shield for potentially illegal activity,\u201d Rangappa wrote. Other takes on Trump and impeachment: Bill Carter: Colbert wormed his way into Trump\u2019s head Nicole Hemmer: Why it\u2019s so scary when Trump tweets about civil war Peter Eisner: Mike Pence can\u2019t escape Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal Michael D\u2019Antonio: The other secret calls that could sink Trump James D. Schultz: Bill Barr doesn\u2019t deserve hate from Democrats Botham Jean, a 26-year-old Dallas man, was at home eating ice cream one night last year when a police officer \u201cwalked in his front door and murdered him,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. The now former officer, Amber Guyger, was convicted and sentenced last week to 10 years in prison. \u201cWhat this guilty verdict may at least show is there are some lines even white police officers can\u2019t cross when killing unarmed black people,\u201d Filipovic wrote. Many Americans were taken by the embrace of forgiveness Jean\u2019s 18-year-old brother, Brandt Jean, offered Guyger during her sentencing. \u201cI get why others only felt inspiration, and were moved by such a selfless act,\u201d wrote Issac Bailey. \u201cThe faith that moved Brandt Jean to say those words is the faith that convinces me to hold onto the idea of redemption for all, even those who do dastardly things.\u201d Even so, he added, \u201cBrandt Jean and his family had every right to be angry. But had he expressed that black anger, many in white America would not be celebrating him today. Heck, had Brandt Jean decided to silently, peacefully kneel in the middle of the courtroom instead of hugging Guyger, I have no doubt that much of white America would have written him off as just another ungrateful, unpatriotic black man\u2013 the way they have Kaepernick.\u201d Kamala Harris: The smart way to change our marijuana laws Douglas Rushkoff: Why Mark Zuckerberg thinks a President Elizabeth Warren would \u2018suck\u2019 James A. Gagliano: Mourning Sandeep Dhaliwal, the pioneering Sikh sheriff\u2019s deputy killed in Texas Roxanne Jones: Why Diahann Carroll was my first girl crush Steve Bullock: A crazy idea to get things done in Washington Peter Bergen: Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u2013 one year ago \u2013 tells us much about Trump\u2019s close ally Kermit Roosevelt and Ruth-Helen Vassilas: Supreme Court justices should have term limits Judith Resnik: Degrading strip search of 200 women prisoners cries out for courts to act W. Ralph Eubanks: Jessye Norman was a diva whose voice could not be denied AND: Wally Conron, the breeder of the first named Labradoodle, would like to take back what he now calls a \u201cgimmick,\u201d wrote Alexandra Horowitz. He worries that he \u201ccreated a monster.\u201d And he\u2019s on to something, she noted. But the point applies more broadly: \u201cThe rise of pedigree dog-breeding prioritized looks over function and the result are the genetic problems we see in so many breeds today.\u201d The standards used to breed bulldogs for example, \u201cled to a dog with such a short nose that they have severe problems breathing in the heat, or with even the least amount of exercise \u2014 which includes \u2018walking.\u2019\u201d \u201cInterestingly, by cross-breeding dogs, as with the oodles, the genetic problems purebred dogs face can be eliminated, if one continues cross-breeding (as usually does not happen in oodle breeding). Over generations, we\u2019d wind up with a new dog, one likely to be less crazy and healthier. We\u2019d wind up with my favorite dog \u2014 the mutt.\u201d",

This however is real life and, with impeachment investigations beginning, understanding the key elements of the complaint will be critical in following the events that unfold. While the White House continues to deny any wrongdoing, the scope of activity presented in the complaint raises many alarming issues. Here are the five main plot points to watch for as Congress takes steps to follow up on these blockbuster allegations. A common talking point among many supporters of President Donald Trump is that the complaint is based on second-hand information, or hearsay. And, yes, the whistleblower does note not being \u201ca direct witness to most of the events described.\u201d But this point would have been taken into consideration when the ICIG reviewed whether the complaint was \u201ccredible,\u201d as he was required to do under the whistleblower statute. Notably, the ICIG still concluded that the report was \u201ccredible.\u201d Two reasons the whistleblower complaint could spell impeachment This judgment could be questioned if it weren\u2019t for two important things. First, the day before the release of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, the White House released a memo containing a real-time transcription of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This call is the same one referenced in Part I of the complaint. Even based on secondhand knowledge, the whistleblower\u2019s account of the call was identical in key details to what actually took place: That the President requested Ukraine to 1) investigate the activities of Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden; 2) assist in efforts to link 2016 election interference with Ukraine; and 3) work with Attorney General Bill Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on these matters. More importantly, the complaint indicates that it is based on accounts from at least six White House officials who did have consistent, first-hand knowledge of the call and other events described in the complaint. This means that there are at least a half dozen witnesses whom Congress can call to corroborate the allegations made in the complaint. No scandal is truly complete without a coverup, and this one appears to have it. Part II of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleges that the officials who witnessed the call first hand were directed by White House lawyers to move the verbatim transcript from where it would normally be stored to a separate system which is used for highly classified information and to which access is highly restricted. (This part of the complaint has been confirmed by the White House.) Because the President\u2019s call with Ukraine did not relate to a \u201ccodeword\u201d operation (typically used for covert actions), it would ordinarily not meet the standards to be stored on the restricted server. The classification markings on the released transcript supports this, as it is marked at the Secret classification level, a relatively low level of classification (while not the lowest). Dick Durbin: Why Trump's handling of Ukraine demands investigation Importantly, the complaint indicates that officials who received the orders believed that the transcript was moved in order to conceal evidence that might be politically embarrassing to the President and the White House \u2013 and the appendix to the complaint alleges that the systems had been misused on other occasions for the same purpose. In addition to an attempt to conceal a possible crime or abuse of power by the President, this on its own could be a violation of an Executive Order, which prohibits \u201coverclassifying\u201d information in order to \u201cprevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.\u201d Congress will undoubtedly seek to find out who gave orders to try to conceal these transcripts from further distribution and possibly seek to obtain other \u201chidden\u201d transcripts with world leaders. The complaint indicates that at least one State Department official, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, listened in on the call between Trump and Zelensky (though the State Department has denied this to be true). In addition, Part III of the complaint states that US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker (who has since resigned), along with US Ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials on the day following Trump\u2019s call. The whistleblower received multiple readouts of these meetings, which indicated that these State Department officials advised Ukrainian officials on how to \u201cnavigate\u201d the requests that Trump made to Zelensky on the phone. To understand Trump's Ukraine call, you gotta know the secret code If true, this would mean that officials from the State Department were not only aware of Trump (ab)using the power of his office to extract personal favors from a foreign nation, but were engaged in efforts to help bring them to fruition. The process of organizing these official meetings, as well as the readouts of what took place in them, would leave an extensive paper trail. Three committees of Congress have already subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce all documents related to meetings with Ukraine, and Pompeo himself will likely be called to testify about them. If he complies, the public will learn more about what expectations were conveyed to Zelensky regarding his compliance with Trump\u2019s wishes. If he doesn\u2019t comply, the House can use his defiance as evidence of obstruction, which could form its own basis for an article of impeachment. The whistleblower complaint contains only a few references to Barr \u2013 that he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, and that he was mentioned \u201cin tandem\u201d with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, several times (more on Giuliani, below). The primary source \u2013 the White House memo \u2013 substantiates this allegation, with Trump telling Zelensky to communicate with Barr on the investigations he requested. Notably, the Justice Department released a statement just after the White House transcript release went public, denying Barr made contact with the Ukrainians. But Barr\u2019s role in this unfolding drama takes on significance after the complaint was filed. This is because once the ICIG determined that the complaint was credible, he passed the complaint on to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. At that point, Maguire was required by law to transmit the complaint, along with any additional comments he chose to provide, to Congress. Avlon: Impeachment is nothing anyone should be cheering He didn\u2019t. Instead, Maguire took the complaint to the White House, ostensibly (based on his testimony to Congress) to inquire whether the contents were covered by executive privilege. Two things happened next. First, the White House obtained a legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, which determined that the subject matter of the complaint did not fall under the jurisdiction of the DNI, and therefore could not be brought under the whistleblower statute. The OLC stated that the proper channel for the DNI was to present a criminal referral of the matter to the Justice Department. The DNI did so, and the Justice Department determined that the complaint required no further investigation, either as a possible violation of campaign finance laws (which prohibits soliciting any \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign state or person) or any other law. Of course, Barr is ultimately in charge of both the OLC and the Criminal Division of the FBI. Since he himself is implicated in the allegations, he should have been required to recuse in any evaluation of the complaint by his agency. Congress will likely seek to find out what role he played in either the OLC decision or the decision not to investigate, why Barr did not recuse and if he played any other role in the allegations laid out in the complaint. Congress may also choose to call the head of the OLC, Steven Engel, to explain his reasoning, and in particular why issues regarding handling of classified information would not fall under the jurisdiction of the DNI. Perhaps the most perplexing part of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is the role of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney. According to the complaint, Giuliani reached out privately to several advisers to the Ukrainian President as, based on accounts of US officials, \u201cdirect\u201d follow-up to Trump\u2019s requests in his July 25 phone call. Notably, these meetings are substantiated by public statements Giuliani made on TV and in news interviews. In addition, footnote 9 of the complaint states that Giuliani claimed to be working on gathering information to provide to the Justice Department as part of its official investigation into to \u201corigins\u201d of the Russia probe, which is currently being handled by Connecticut US Attorney John Durham, and who is also reportedly looking into Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election interference. (It should be noted here that the intelligence community has unanimously concluded that Russia was behind said interference.) Congress will no doubt want to hear directly from Giuliani about his role in all of these efforts. Giuliani has already indicated that he may invoke attorney-client privilege to refrain from testifying (because he is acting in a private, rather than official capacity, executive privilege would not apply). But this may be an uphill battle.  The crime-fraud exception states that  the attorney-client privilege cannot be used as a shield for potentially illegal activity. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in U.S. v. Nixon did not allow the President to use executive privilege to shield potentially illegal conduct in a criminal proceeding. This precedent  would likely apply as strongly in the case of a private attorney-client privilege. Even beyond that, the privilege only covers communications between Giuliani and Trump himself: Communications between Giuliani and officials either in the State Department or Justice Department would not be covered. Congress will want to find out: How closely was Giuliani working with US government officials who were aware that he was tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s potentially illegal requests? Given the sheer number of characters and plot lines emerging in the whistleblower saga, the American public may have a difficult time keeping up. But the only thing they have to remember is the most important question in any scandal: Who knew what, and when did they know it?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news. The President of the United States has a massive platform. He holds the most powerful office in the world. With just a few words, a president can launch a war, move markets, inspire millions, and quite literally change the course of world history. So, of course, Donald Trump is using that privilege to attack a celebrity he thinks doesn\u2019t love him enough. Apparently seething about an MSNBC town hall on criminal justice, where participants issued what he deemed insufficient praise for a piece of criminal justice legislation Trump signed, the President tweeted, \u201cI SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise.\u201d And then: \u201cGuys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\u201d That \u201cfilthy mouthed wife\u201d is Chrissy Teigen, a model, author, and Twitter personality in her own right. Teigen leaned into the characterization, tweeting a (to my mind) delightfully filthy response that even worked in one particularly lewd word for female genitalia that the President had previously been caught on tape claiming to grab (Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.\u201d Teigen: \u201clol what a p**** a** b****. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president.\u201d) Donald Trump is a bad-insult machine, and he regularly targets men, too. But his objection to foul, filthy language is primarily directed at women. Chrissy Teigen is a \u201cfilthy mouthed wife.\u201d Ilhan Omar is \u201cFoul Mouthed Omar.\u201d Elizabeth Warren \u201chas a nasty mouth.\u201d Congresswomen who criticized him should apologize for the \u201cfoul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!\u201d (\u201cDisgusting,\u201d by the way, is a word he mainly reserves for women he disdains.) Why Trump keeps calling women 'nasty' This is from a President who isn\u2019t exactly known for his decorum. But Trump has been clear. He mainly expects women to be ornamental, not outspoken. Like children, they should be seen (and present themselves as attractive), but not heard. This is evident in Trump\u2019s own hiring decisions: As President he has brought on far fewer women (and people of color) than his predecessors, making his cabinet the whitest and most male in recent history. Women are fine in theory, but not in positions where they might challenge, inform or even contradict him. Teigen, luckily, is an excellent foil for a fame-thirsty President who, behind all the bluster, is fundamentally seeking the approval from the many who have long rejected him for being boorish, uncouth, racist, and generally repulsive. She\u2019s not a politician, and she doesn\u2019t have to play by political niceties. Nor is she a typical celebrity, clinging to fame by remaining apolitical and hoping that no one boycotts her next movie. Teigen is, indeed, \u201cfilthy mouthed,\u201d insofar as she sometimes uses curse words and often speaks her mind quite plainly. John Legend and Rashad Robinson: End money bail now She\u2019s also refreshingly authentic, the kind of celebrity people (like yours truly)  who generally ignore celebrities are surprised to find  so winning. She has the same kind of social media magnetism as Trump, except that hers comes from being smart, self-effacing, funny, while to many people (like yours truly) his is more the \u201ccan this really be happening?\u201d shock-horror combo. No one ever wins a Twitter war, but in Teigen v. Trump, she has clearly come out on top. No doubt our thin-skinned President, who reportedly whiles away his evenings yelling at the television, will try to strike back in his own loosely-cogent (to be kind), inexplicably capitalized way. Teigen is a woman, after all, and she has embarrassed him. But women are watching. And even women who may not pay close attention to politics know the feeling of a man jeering at us for being insufficiently ladylike. We know the frustration and fury that rises when we are identified not by our own accomplishments or even our own names, but by our husband or closest male relative (Trump didn\u2019t even use Teigen\u2019s name; she is, as far as he is concerned, John Legend\u2019s wife). It is hard not to cry when you watch this video A Twitter spat isn\u2019t going to lose Trump the election. But with every repeated act of misogyny \u2013 blatant or subtle or in between \u2013 voters see him in sharper relief. His angry white male base may see in him a hero standing up to the harpies and harridans whom they resent as nagging or emasculating or see as threatening to take their jobs. But the many, many women who make up more than half of the US electorate don\u2019t see a hero. They see a man who hates us. Every new sexist outburst seeds a little more clarity, both in women and the men who actually like us. And each voter who sees Trump for who he is becomes a voter who cannot cast a ballot for him in 2020.",

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. This piece has been update with a question and answer portion. President Donald Trump and his political backers \u2013 including his in-the-bag Attorney General William Barr \u2013 thus far have managed to blunt the impact of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s astonishing findings about Russian interference in the 2016 election, the eager embrace by some Trump campaign officials of those criminal efforts and Trump\u2019s furious efforts to obstruct justice. Trump, Barr and others have employed a double-barreled approach: first, loudly misrepresent Mueller\u2019s findings (\u201cNo Collusion,\u201d \u201cNo Obstruction,\u201d \u201cTotal Exoneration\u201d) and second, count on the American public and Congress not to bother reading the 400-plus page report. For the months since the public release of the Mueller report, it\u2019s been so far, so good. But now \u2013 with  Mueller set to testify under subpoena in Congress on July 17 \u2013 time is almost up on Trump and Barr\u2019s prolonged public campaign of distortion and denial. The truth is about to come out. Mueller\u2019s testimony will be a pivotal moment for the Trump administration and Congress alike. Trump recognized from the start that Mueller\u2019s investigation posed an existential threat to his presidency: according to Mueller, when Trump first learned of the appointment of Special Counsel, he wailed \u201cOh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I\u2019m f**ked.\u201d  Telling first reaction there. Nor has Trump been able to maintain a public poker face about Mueller\u2019s findings. Even while claiming incorrectly that Mueller somehow exonerated him across the board, Trump couldn\u2019t help but let his dread of Mueller\u2019s findings shine through, labelling parts of the report \u201ctotal bullshit,\u201d calling Mueller a \u201cfool\u201d and accusing his own former White House counsel Don McGahn \u2013 whose testimony is particularly devastating on obstruction \u2013 of lying to Mueller. Through it all, public and congressional support has built slowly \u2013 but not decisively \u2013 toward an impeachment inquiry. That could change quickly when Mueller testifies. Even if Mueller does nothing more than rehash the findings in his report (as he has vowed to do), his findings are devastating to Trump.  As over 1,000 former federal prosecutors (including me) have concluded, the report contains more than enough evidence to indict Trump on obstruction, if not for the Justice Department policy against indicting the sitting president. Now Mueller\u2019s testimony will bring his investigation to life like no written report ever could. Any prosecutor or trial lawyer can tell you: written reports are inherently dry and two-dimensional, but live testimony is visceral and memorable. Few members of the public (or, apparently, Congress) have read Mueller\u2019s report \u2013 but you can bet many, many more will be watching him live on July 17. What's next in the battle of Barr v. Congress Nor is Mueller truly within his rights to decline to answer questions that go beyond his report. Mueller has been subpoenaed. That means his testimony has been lawfully compelled by Congress, and he is not free to pick and choose what to answer. Moreover, Mueller himself has left plenty of monumental question unanswered: Would you have charged Trump with obstruction if he was not sitting President? Who in the Trump campaign \u201cexpected it would  benefit\u201d from criminal Russian election interference, and in what ways? How specifically did Barr misstate the \u201ccontext, nature and substance\u201d of Mueller\u2019s investigation? It won\u2019t be long now until we get answers. Trump and Barr have had their chance to spin and distract and point fingers. Soon, the truth will have its day. Mary, Utah: What do you think of the House Judiciary Committee allowing former Trump aide Hope Hicks to testify behind closed doors? I think it was a tactical mistake to allow Hicks to testify behind closed doors, for two primary reasons. First, by allowing Hicks \u2013 one of the most important witnesses to Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct justice, as detailed in the Mueller report \u2013 to testify behind closed doors, the Judiciary Committee blunted the impact of her testimony. The Committee released a written transcript of her testimony, and hardly anybody noticed or cared. Live public testimony, by contrast \u2013 with Hicks detailing the obstructive acts that she witnessed, live on camera and in her own voice \u2013 would have made a stronger impact on Congress and the public. We should see the opposite effect when Mueller testifies publicly next month; I expect that his written report will come to life in the public consciousness like never before. Second, the closed-door session enabled the White House to essentially shut down all meaningful lines of questioning. Administration lawyers objected to over 150 questions, and Hicks refused to answer even where her office was physically located within the White House. It is one thing to object 150 times behind closed doors, but quite another to object repeatedly while live on television. The visual of White House lawyers objecting repeatedly would have created powerful images of obstructionism in action. Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler stated after the testimony that it was all part of the plan: get Hicks to testify behind closed doors, let her attorneys essentially shut down the testimony with frivolous objections, and then use the transcript to illustrate for a judge the absurdity of the White House\u2019s legal obstructionism. But the fact remains: in the two-plus months since the Mueller report became public, the Committee has not obtained substantive, public testimony from a single firsthand witness, and has not even gone to court yet to enforce its subpoenas on McGahn, Hicks, Barr and others. Nadler has vowed to go to court to enforce the Committee\u2019s subpoenas, but the question remains: when \u2013 and why the delay? William, Australia:  What is the difference between executive privilege and the White House\u2019s claim that close presidential advisers have absolute immunity from subpoenas? The White House has invoked two similar but separate legal theories \u2013 executive privilege and absolute immunity \u2013 to try to block administration officials from responding to congressional subpoenas. Executive privilege means that certain communications between the President (or arguably other Executive Branch officials) and top advisers are confidential and not subject to subpoena. The rationale, set forth in the 1974 Supreme Court case US v. Richard Nixon, is that the President needs to have certain candid communications that should remain out of the public eye \u2013 particularly those relating to sensitive matters of national security or military strategy. Mueller's message: Congress, it's your turn Absolute immunity is an even broader concept that no Executive Branch employee ever has to provide any information to Congress \u2013 for any reason. While no court has recognized such a sweeping theory, the White House\u2019s stated rationale is based on the separation of powers theory \u2013 specifically, that the Executive Branch, as a co-equal branch of government, cannot be forced to comply with orders from the Legislative Branch. The counter-argument is that absolute immunity, if accepted, would elevate the Executive Branch and make it entirely unaccountable to Congress. The White House has used both of these legal arguments, at times separately and at times together, to try to block the testimony of McGahn, Hicks and others.  While I believe that both lines of argument ultimately will fail if challenged in court by Congress, the cases could take months to decide. Even if the administration loses on its legal claims, it might win simply by delay alone if it can drag out testimony until after the 2020 election. Larry, New York:  Why hasn\u2019t former Attorney General Jeff Sessions been called to testify by the House Judiciary Committee? Thus far, the House has focused on the primary witnesses to Trump\u2019s obstructive acts, including Mueller himself, plus McGahn and Hicks, both of whom \u2013 according to the Mueller report \u2013 directly witnessed some of Trump\u2019s most flagrant conduct (including Trump\u2019s effort to have McGahn fire Mueller and then to have McGahn lie about the effort). Sessions is likely part of a secondary group of witnesses whose testimony, though perhaps not as central to Mueller\u2019s findings, nonetheless is important. Based on the Mueller report findings, Sessions can testify about Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure him to un-recuse himself and re-take control of (and limit or end) Mueller\u2019s investigation. Other potential second-wave witnesses could include former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former Trump White House aide Rick Dearborn, both of whom witnessed the President\u2019s campaign to pressure Sessions. I believe the House eventually will hear from these witnesses. Taken together, they paint a compelling picture of Trump\u2019s prolonged (but ultimately unsuccessful) effort to seize control of, and stifle, Mueller\u2019s investigation. Jim, Oregon: Are attempts to obstruct justice treated in the law as actual obstruction of justice? Yes. Most federal criminal statutes contain an \u201cattempt\u201d provision establishing that unsuccessful efforts to commit a crime are no different than successfully completed crimes. Sometimes, the law provides lower penalties for attempts than for completed crimes; for example, federal murder is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment or the death penalty, while attempted murder carries a maximum of 20 years.  Federal obstruction law imposes penalties on anyone who \u201cobstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.\u201d  Obstruction and attempted obstruction carry the same penalty (20 years max). So, if Trump tried to obstruct justice but ultimately failed, he is no less liable than if the efforts had succeeded. 1. Will the White House or Justice Department try to block Mueller\u2019s testimony by raising specious legal objections (including executive privilege or absolute immunity, as discussed above)? 2. How will the Supreme Court rule on the high-stakes case about inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census? 3. How will the controversial trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher \u2013 in which a prosecution witness unexpectedly took responsibility for the charged murder \u2013 turn out?",

Have any comprehension of the role of a public servant? See a purpose in his life other than elevating himself into ever-higher echelons of wealth and influence? If you were going by his remarks in a recent interview with Axios, the answer would have to be no. Kushner sputtered and spun, looking like a little boy dressed up in his father\u2019s suit, unable to give a definitive or direct answer to nearly every question asked of him. From abortion rights to Israel, Palestinians to the presidential campaign, Kushner served word salad. It was a rare and jarring look inside the mind of a cipher made suddenly and undeservedly powerful. What we saw: A whole lot of nothing. The urgent takeaway: voters cannot squander the nation\u2019s upcoming opportunity to restore competence, stature and sanity to the White House. Kushner\u2019s interview would have been comical if this underqualified senior adviser didn\u2019t have the ear of the leader of the free world, and didn\u2019t, absurdly, believe himself the right guy to advise on any number of matters \u2013 including taking over the Middle East peace process. Holder: Trump knew what he was doing with birtherism claim His real qualifications? He married a Trump, and his father-in-law likes him. Before that, Kushner had achieved little beyond a mediocre academic career, a massive real estate failure via his criminal dad\u2019s company, and the decision to purchase a newspaper \u2013 The New York Observer \u2013 as a vanity project that he promptly ran into the ground. This White House is such a pulsating example of unearned privilege (see here, here, here, here and here), that in a nation that prides itself on meritocracy and swears that those who work hard are rewarded, we see that it\u2019s also possible to be a rich dolt and still occupy one of the most powerful positions on earth. (In the case of Kushner\u2019s father-in-law, whose trajectory of failure and mediocrity landed him in the Oval Office, to occupy what may be the most powerful position on earth.) Just how ignorant, middling and amoral is Kushner? The Axios interview offers some startling clues. Among them is that he manages to spin his utter incompetence as a good thing. Asked by Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan to name the thing Trump will be known for in 50 or 100 years, he replied, in part: \u201cWhat this President did is he represented an outsider who came in, brought in a ton of people who never would\u2019ve been in Washington before who were not \u2018qualified\u2019 by conventional standards,\u201d Kushner said, thus absolving himself of his own pretender status. \u201cAnd he\u2019s brought in a ton of people that have brought great results to this country both economically and from a national security point of view.\u201d Kushner breaks silence on White House security clearance It is true that Trump brought in a great many \u201coutsiders\u201d who were not qualified for their administration jobs by conventional standards (or any standards, really). His cabinet members and other appointments have been often inept, many of them just seriously inexperienced. Even his ambassadors are the least qualified in living memory. As a result, America\u2019s reputation worldwide has been sullied, we are facing unprecedented attacks on freedom of the press, election interference from a hostile foreign power has gone largely ignored by the administration, and we may be facing a constitutional crisis. Those are not \u201cgreat results.\u201d They are disastrous to our living democracy. In the Axios interview, Kushner also defended Trump from accusations of racism, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t not be a racist for 69 years and then run for president and be a racist.\u201d This would be relevant if Trump hadn\u2019t been a racist for 69 years, but in fact he has spent significant time and money over the past several decades pushing his racist views. Recall, for one consequential example (among many), the Justice Department\u2019s 1973 crackdown on Trump\u2019s real estate organization for screening rental applicants by race (Trump settled the case without admitting wrongdoing). Or Trump\u2019s decision in 1989 to take out a newspaper ad pushing the death penalty after five African American teenagers were accused of rape in Central Park; they were later exonerated, but Trump refused to accept it. Kushner, of course, knows all about this. Trump wanted Jared and Ivanka fired, new book claims Asked specifically about Trump\u2019s promotion of the birther canard about President Obama, Kushner repeatedly refused to answer \u2013 concluding with: \u201cUh, like I said I was not involved in that. That was a long time ago.\u201d This was par for the course in the interview. When confronted with inconvenient information \u2013 like the fact that Kushner\u2019s friend Saudi Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered, the CIA has concluded, the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was living in the United States \u2013 Kushner similarly hedged. (What is the administration waiting for to hold Mohammed Bin Salman accountable, he was asked? \u201cI believe that there\u2019s a report that they\u2019re working on.\u201d) He did the same on the question of whether he supports abortion rights: \u201cI\u2019m here to enforce his (Trump\u2019s) positions. His position is the one that as a staffer in the White House will work to push.\u201d) There\u2019s an ongoing fiction that those around Trump are keeping this rig afloat, and that even if the President is small-minded and spends his days yelling at the television and tweeting, those around him are ably steering the ship.  The Kushner interview lays bare how false that is. Trump has put sycophants and loyal family members in influential positions over people who actually know what they\u2019re doing. The Trump family are the ones at the wheel. We can\u2019t lose our ability to be shocked by how low this floor keeps dropping. And the influence of someone who is simultaneously profoundly clueless and ill-equipped for his job, and yet also self-admiring of his \u201coutsider\u201d status, is dangerous. Experience matters. Knowledge matters. Without it, we simply have a government of know-nothings \u2013 advising a President desperately in need of better angels whispering in his ear.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In this weekly column \u201cCross-exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. Our system of checks and balances is out of balance. Over the past several months, President Donald Trump and the White House have taken a blunt \u2013 but thus far effective \u2013 tack in response to efforts by Congress to exercise its core constitutional oversight authority: You\u2019ll get nothing, and you\u2019ll like it. Members of Congress have expressed frustration with the executive branch\u2019s stonewalling. But, until now, they have taken little action and achieved no measurable results in their efforts to obtain crucial information on important issues, including the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Now Trump has raised the ante by asserting executive privilege over the entire unredacted Mueller report, trying to keep private the materials that Democrats have subpoenaed. This comes as the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to proceed with a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt on Wednesday for refusing to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena. With Wednesday\u2019s vote, Congress has begun to fight back and stand up for itself. This vote matters on two levels. First, a contempt holding against the Attorney General is (or should be) an important symbolic statement. The Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the nation\u2019s laws, yet Congress is asserting that Barr defied his lawful exercise of oversight authority. Then again, congressional contempt isn\u2019t the scarlet letter it used to be. During the previous administration, Congress held then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, so now we will have seen Attorneys General held in contempt two administrations in a row. Contempt has begun to feel like an empty formality. Second, today\u2019s contempt vote signals the end of months\u2019 worth of legal and political posturing. The real fight begins now. What's next in the battle of Barr v. Congress Congress has three primary means to enforce its will, all imperfect. First, Congress has its own enforcement capacity, including a sergeant at arms and an almost-quaint on-premises jail cell that has not been used in many decades. (Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted jokingly but pointedly that, \u201cWe do have a little jail in the basement of the Capitol. But if we were arresting all the people in the administration, we would have overcrowded jail situation, and I\u2019m not for that.\u201d) Second, Congress can refer a matter for criminal contempt proceedings. The problem is that referral would go to the Justice Department, headed by Barr himself \u2013 so don\u2019t count on the Justice Department jumping into action. Third, Congress can take the issue to court, which appears to be the next step here. But civil court proceedings typically take months, if not years. (Congress should consider requesting that one judge be appointed a special master to handle the expected glut of legal disputes between Congress and the executive branch in expedited fashion.) Until now, Congress and the White House have been circling one another menacingly. With today\u2019s contempt vote, the bell has rung. The real fight is about to begin, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Now, your questions. Solomon, Alabama: How can Trump prevent Don McGahn, former White House counsel, from testifying before Congress in response to a subpoena? House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler has subpoenaed McGahn for documents, likely as a prelude to a subpoena for live testimony in Congress. The stakes are high, as McGahn gave Mueller powerful firsthand evidence about Trump\u2019s potentially obstructive acts. Although McGahn no longer works for the White House and is a private citizen, the White House \u201cdirected that he not produce\u201d the subpoenaed documents. Trump is trying to prevent McGahn\u2019s testimony by invoking executive privilege \u2013 the notion that conversations between Trump and McGahn while he was White House counsel are privileged, and McGahn cannot testify about those conversations without Trump\u2019s approval. Barr pointedly reserved the President\u2019s right to invoke executive privilege \u2013 perhaps inadvertently slipping and saying \u201cwe\u201d haven\u2019t waived the privilege \u2013 in response to a question about McGahn testifying in Congress. The next day, Trump told Fox News, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can let him [McGahn]\u201d testify. William Barr now has to try to defend the indefensible Trump\u2019s executive privilege argument is likely to fail on three levels. First, Trump already has waived it by allowing McGahn to speak with Mueller in the first place. In most circumstances, once a privilege has been waived, the privilege is gone and cannot be reclaimed. Second, privileges are not absolute, and one exception is known as \u201ccrime-fraud.\u201d Conversations are not privileged if made in furtherance of a crime \u2013 here, arguably, Trump\u2019s efforts to obstruct justice by telling McGahn to have Mueller fired and then telling McGahn to lie about it. Third, in the 1974 decision U.S. v. Richard Nixon, the Supreme Court unanimously held that executive privilege protects national security and military secrets but is not a general shield against potential criminal liability. Trump\u2019s team will fight like mad \u2013 clearly, they fear McGahn\u2019s testimony \u2013 but do not expect them to succeed in the effort to silence McGahn. The problem for Democrats is that the court fight could take months, or years, to play out. Carmela, Arizona: Can Barr be indicted or impeached for lying to Congress when he said he did not know if Mueller agreed with his summary of the report? It is a federal crime to lie to Congress \u2013 just ask former Trump attorney Michael Cohen \u2013 and it requires Simone Biles-level gymnastics to spin Barr\u2019s testimony as anything other than a lie. During Barr\u2019s April 10 Senate testimony, Sen. Chris Van Hollen asked, \u201cDid Bob Mueller support your conclusion?\u201d  Barr responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion.\u201d Turns out that before Barr gave that testimony, he had received a letter from Mueller stating that Barr\u2019s March 24 summary letter \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature and substance\u201d of Mueller\u2019s \u201cwork and conclusions.\u201d When confronted last week with his own prior testimony, Barr tap danced, claiming he didn\u2019t think Mueller found his letter \u201cmisleading\u201d \u2013 which is squarely contradicted by Mueller\u2019s actual letter. While Barr seemingly lied in the everyday sense of the term, it\u2019s more complicated to prove he committed perjury under federal criminal law. Barr\u2019s explanation for his testimony relies on hair splitting and is not particularly convincing. But it could muddy the waters enough to prevent a perjury charge, which requires a precise showing of falsity. And there\u2019s a practical problem, too: The only entity capable of charging Barr for lying to Congress is the Justice Department, which is headed by Barr himself. Even if Barr does not get indicted, Congress has the authority to impeach an Attorney General, and several members have called for Barr\u2019s impeachment or resignation. As a practical matter, it is exceedingly unlikely that impeachment, even if pursued, will result in Barr\u2019s removal from office. After all, Republicans control the Senate, which can convict on impeachment only with a two-thirds vote. Impeachment or not, Barr has done incalculable damage to his own credibility. Sean, New Mexico: If Barr decides not to release the full Mueller report and a subpoena is unsuccessful, is there anything preventing the next Attorney General from releasing the full report? No. Rep. Jerrold Nadler has set a Wednesday deadline for Barr to produce the unredacted report to Congress. Even if Barr misses that deadline, and even if Nadler\u2019s subsequent efforts to obtain the unredacted report \u2013 potentially holding Barr in contempt of Congress and then bringing a civil suit to compel production \u2013 do not succeed, there is nothing to prevent the next Attorney General from releasing the full report. Barr ensures Congress can't stop Trump now That said, a successor might feel bound to keep in place certain categories of redactions including, for example, classified materials or materials that might unduly harm the reputational interests of peripheral players. But as time passes, the need for redactions will subside. For example, Barr has redacted materials that might impact pending criminal investigations; as those investigations end, the need for secrecy dissipates. Harry, Montreal: If Trump fears being prosecuted after he leaves office, what prevents him on his last day in office from pardoning himself for all crimes or resigning and having the Vice President pardon him for all crimes? In the report, Mueller conspicuously notes that while the Justice Department prevents indicting a sitting president, \u201ca criminal investigation during the President\u2019s term is permissible\u201d and \u201ca President does not have immunity after he leaves office.\u201d Trump has announced that \u201cI have the absolute right to pardon myself.\u201d We do not know whether a self-pardon would withstand legal scrutiny in the courts because, of course, it has never happened. The President likely would argue that the pardon power, as stated in the Constitution, is unlimited: The President \u201cshall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.\u201d Nothing in that text prohibits a self-pardon. An opponent would counter that a self-pardon contravenes the most fundamental tenet of our legal system: that no person is above the law. Legally, there is nothing to prevent a president from resigning on his last day in office and receiving a pardon from a vice president who ascends (barring some illicit arrangement, such as bribery). But such a move is exceedingly unlikely because of the political and historical stain it would leave on the legacy of both individuals. William, Wisconsin: It is commonly stated that ignorance of the law is no defense. Donald Trump Jr. has not been charged over the Trump Tower meeting, in part because he didn\u2019t realize this was potentially illegal. Can you explain this? Mueller analyzes Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s liability for the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting as a potential violation of criminal law barring solicitation or receipt of campaign contributions from foreign nationals. Before the meeting, Russian nationals had offered dirt on Hillary Clinton, prompting Trump Jr.\u2019s response, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say, I love it.\u201d (It also would be a crime if Trump Jr. had conspired \u2013 agreed \u2013 with others, including Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, to seek foreign election aid. Neither Kushner nor Manafort obtained such aid.) Weighing against such a case is that when the meeting happened, the promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton wasn\u2019t provided. Generally, ignorance of the law is no defense to a crime. However, prosecutors must show that a defendant acted with requisite criminal intent, which varies depending on the crime. Campaign finance violations are unusual, requiring a \u201cwillful\u201d act. As Mueller explains in the report, citing case law: \u201cA willful violation will require some \u2018proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the law.\u2019 \u201d Why I signed letter saying Trump committed a crime The prosecutor need not show that the defendant was expert in campaign finance law or knew every nuance. Rather, the prosecutor must show that the defendant \u201chad general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\u201d Mueller concludes that \u201cthe government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.\u201d Based on the facts discovered by Mueller, I disagree with this legal conclusion. Trump Jr. was centrally involved in his father\u2019s campaign and must have known something at least generally about campaign finance. And Trump Jr. tried to mislead the public about the meeting afterward, which shows his guilty knowledge. If he had no idea he may have broken the law, why did he hide the true purpose of the meeting? Ultimately, however, Mueller concluded otherwise, and his inability to prove Trump Jr.\u2019s general knowledge of campaign finance laws was a primary factor counseling against indictment.  1. Will the House and Robert Mueller agree to a date and terms under which Mueller will testify, despite the President\u2019s objection? 2. Now that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has refused the House\u2019s request for Trump\u2019s tax returns, will the House hold Mnuchin in contempt and bring a legal challenge to court? 3. Will the House seek to compel testimony from Barr after he skipped out on the originally scheduled date, purportedly because he did not want to face questioning from staff attorneys?",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. President Donald Trump has declared that executive privilege should keep private the redacted parts of the Mueller report, and a congressional committee is moving to vote on whether to charge his attorney general with contempt. So clearly House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler was right when he said on CNN Wednesday, \u201cThe phrase constitutional crisis has been overused, but certainly it\u2019s a constitutional crisis \u2026\u201d This is not the first time that we have heard such warnings, but now this crisis is very real. If the Defense Department were applying its crisis scale to our political situation, it might well call it Defcon 1. By definition, a constitutional crisis is a moment when the mechanisms of government are not working to resolve a fundamental problem. The nation has been through a number of these moments, such as the secession of southern states which resulted in the Civil War, and President Richard Nixon\u2019s resistance to turning over White House recordings in 1974. House Democrats have ramped up their investigations into multiple elements of this presidency, ranging from the evidence presented in the Mueller report, which pointed to obstruction of justice, to efforts to see his tax returns. In a bold rebuff, the President is saying no to almost everything. He is resisting subpoenas, he is trying to prevent people from testifying and he is asserting executive privilege. As House Democrats attempt to flex their oversight muscle, the President is just saying no. Democrats are facing a huge problem The crisis is a result of several factors. Most important, Trump has an extraordinarily grandiose sense of what his power is about. He does not feel constrained by the norms and traditions that have held other presidents in check. He has now brought on board an attorney general, William Barr, who for years has been a proponent of a muscular executive branch in which the President has few formal limits. The combination in the Oval Office has produced explosive results. What\u2019s more, when Trump takes evasive steps he does so with immense institutional support. The powers of the presidency have been rebuilt since the mid-1970s, when Congress tried to reassert itself in response to Vietnam and Watergate. Over the decades, presidents in both parties have gradually strengthened the executive branch. The limits of what Congress can do in its efforts to oversee an aggressive president have become painfully apparent. Even the formal mechanisms available to Congress, such as contempt citations, are cumbersome and could take years to resolve. Then there is a Republican Party that stands by the President no matter what he does. Even as very prominent conservatives, such as Kellyanne Conway\u2019s husband \u2013 and a Trump antagonist \u2013 George Conway, have called for impeachment proceedings to begin, congressional Republicans are standing firm. The most important stonewall in Washington right now is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who took it upon himself to say \u201ccase closed\u201d after the Mueller report and has made it very clear he and the Republicans will not support any kind of substantive investigation or impeachment hearings. This cold partisan reality has made it extremely difficult for Democrats to muster the power needed to take on these battles. With Republicans saying no to oversight, and Republicans in control of the Senate, the President finds himself with strong backing to resist Democratic demands. And finally there is a Democratic Party, which until now has exhibited considerable political fear about flexing its institutional muscle. The concern that does exist in the Democratic Caucus about the way that the president is employing his power has been overwhelmed by political worries of triggering the kind of backlash that Republicans faced in the 1990s, or of undercutting the odds for Democrats to win back the White House in 2020. Democrats clearly have reason to act cautiously and slowly before unleashing such a monumental process as impeachment, but there is also a point where events might force their hand and the obligations of holding power could outweigh all other fears.  Numerous party leaders have continued to throw cold water on calls to start impeachment proceedings and they continue to show an abiding faith that the normal rules of engagement will eventually produce results. But the system is not working. The President continues to dare the country to do something about the way that he is using his power and right now nothing immediately effective is happening in response. The only way out of the crisis will be for one of the branches of government to intervene \u2013 as the Supreme Court did with Richard Nixon \u2013 or for Trump to fold. The only other way out will be an election in 2020 that finally brings a new kind of leader to Washington.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. If Democrats are not careful, they will end up in the worst of all political worlds. Since the release of the Mueller report, the party\u2019s leadership in Congress has been extraordinarily hesitant about taking the logical next steps. Faced with a 400-plus page report documenting extensive efforts by the President of the United States to obstruct justice, House Democrats have punted \u2013 making  it pretty clear that impeachment proceedings will not be happening any time soon. Even as the attorney general takes extraordinary steps to obstruct the subsequent hearings into obstruction, Democratic leaders remain tepid about any conversation that involves impeachment. The economy is great, so why are so many Democrats running for White House? Once the damning substance of the Mueller report became clear, there were some Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who called for impeachment proceedings to begin. This would have meant the House voting to refer impeachment to the House Judiciary Committee, which would then conduct an investigation into whether to vote for articles of impeachment. The other option on the table was to decide that impeachment was not worth the political risk, especially since Senate Republicans would inevitably support the President, so that it was time to move on. Thus far, House Democrats have chosen a third, seemingly safer, option of continuing with non-impeachment investigations. The objective was that there needed to be a phase \u2013 like the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973 \u2013 that educates the public and guides public opinion as to what to do. Short of starting impeachment hearings, House Democrats have opened up a number of important committee investigations through the Judiciary and Oversight Committees. But the political risks of this middle-way process have become quickly clear. The President has made it apparent that he will refuse to play ball. Trump has announced that the administration will be ignoring subpoenas, preventing key officials from testifying and possibly invoking executive privilege. Rep. Steve Cohen's KFC stunt wasn't finger-lickin' good During the Senate hearings, the administration\u2019s outlook was on full display. Attorney General William Barr refused to answer some questions and misrepresented crucial findings. We learned that Robert Mueller sent Barr a letter indicating his displeasure with how the report was handled while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats that Barr\u2019s false statements were a \u201ccrime.\u201d When the House Judiciary Committee asked Barr to appear, he refused, objecting to the idea that staff members and not just members of Congress would question him. Democrats seemed flummoxed. When they began their investigations, they still seemed to have assumed that the administration would play by some kind of rules. They hoped that the hearing stage of these investigations would help educate the public and Congress about what has happened and create a more solid basis for determining whether impeachment proceedings should or should not begin. But instead, Democrats are getting nothing other than more obstruction, and the clock keeps ticking. Fearing that the impeachment process will trigger a backlash akin to what Republicans faced in the late 1990s, Democrats are getting caught up in an investigative quagmire that is likely to result in cumbersome legal battles with the administration, uncooperative witnesses, meager information and ongoing news coverage about the clash between the branches rather than the actual substance of the evidence in the Mueller report. Clinton's impeachment offers no lesson on Trump. But there's a case that does At this rate, Democrats could realize their worst fears. They could wind up allowing these multiple investigations to keep dragging out without producing the kind of information that moves public opinion. Given that this is not an impeachment proceeding, Republicans will be able to find some political space to start claiming that Democrats are engaged in endless investigations that don\u2019t lead to an up or down vote. At the same time, the media coverage of the battles over the investigation will overshadow discussions of policy issues favorable to the Democrats and Republicans will berate their opponents for only investigating rather than caring at all about good governance. But the political risks are even worse than this. Senate Republicans are ready to begin two years of their own investigations. While Democrats are perpetually outraged, Republicans are perpetually partisan. As some senators such as Lindsay Graham warned during the Barr hearings, they will open up their own hearings into whether the Obama administration allowed for illegal \u201cspying\u201d into the 2016 Trump campaign. They will ramp up discussions, which Barr seems to support, of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracies and corrupt federal agents. And this is just the start. It is easy to imagine that White House officials are gearing up to launch other investigations as well. What's next in the battle of Barr v. Congress Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, cited a New York Times story about Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and his work in Ukraine in calling for an investigation of the matter. Biden has denied there was a conflict of interest. Democrats need to remember that President Trump will have no hesitation going down this path. While \u201cMake America Great\u201d became his famous campaign slogan, the real message was \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d And Trump will be preparing to do that again to whomever the Democratic candidate might be. While the caution of the Democrats has been pushing them away from what many see as the legitimate and necessary decision to start impeachment hearings, Republicans will be coming after their opponents with hammer and tong. All of the post-Mueller analysis focused on the political risks Democrats faced if they went down the path of impeachment. But the political risks of doing nothing \u2013 besides the Democratic risks of allowing the kinds of activities that have been documented about the President to stand \u2013 are immense.  The Democrats might now find themselves under a torrent of attacks for being the corrupt party while the President will be boasting to his supporters that everything else was a \u201choax.\u201d At some level, through inaction, Democrats will buttress his claims. With strong economic numbers and relative peace abroad, Democratic timidity might be just the political medicine that a struggling Republican Party was hoping for, enough to carry them over the finish line on Election Day.",

He co-hosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. There is a debate raging in Washington about the politics of investigations. Some argue the Democrats should aggressively pursue all avenues to hold President Donald Trump accountable for his actions \u2013 including, for example, holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Many even advocate opening up impeachment hearings to further investigate Trump\u2019s actions. Others warn that the Democrats can go too far in investigating Trump and could experience a backlash from voters. All sides cite evidence from the impeachment process against President Bill Clinton two decades ago to support their arguments. While this is a worthy and important debate, comparing it to the Clinton saga undermines both sides.  It\u2019s getting clearer with each passing day that the two really have little to do with each other. Let\u2019s review the highlights of the Clinton investigation. For all practical purposes, Clinton and his team cooperated with the independent counsel and the congressional investigating bodies. The President testified before the grand jury and even gave blood, literally, to the prosecutors determined to prove his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Unlike Trump, President Clinton never fired the head of the FBI, never threatened to fire the attorney general \u2013 and then did it \u2013 never instructed the White House counsel to fire the independent counsel.  And Clinton never used the bully pulpit to undermine our judicial system. Where he did fight vigorously, and lose, was in the civil case brought by Paula Jones. The legal result was that President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted in the United States Senate. Public opinion swung sharply in his favor as voters saw the Republicans overreaching in their political zeal to have him removed from office.  Clinton\u2019s job approval soared to 73% after he was impeached.  But, as argued above, there is little comparison in the fact pattern of the two cases, so little to be learned politically by juxtaposing them. It's not 1998 anymore. Democrats shouldn't be afraid of impeachment The real comparison here is with the investigation of President Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal. In these cases, the fact pattern is eerily similar. Both Nixon and Trump took aggressive steps to obstruct justice by hampering the investigations into wrongdoing. President Nixon, in the infamous Saturday Night Massacre, cleaned out the top echelon of the Justice Department for defying him on the continuation of the Watergate probe. He installed his own hand-picked loyalists at the Justice Department and the FBI. President Nixon also obstructed the congressional investigations, using executive privilege to limit access to witnesses and documents. And he famously went to the Supreme Court to withhold the so-called smoking gun audio tapes that eventually led to his resignation. All along he sought to undermine both the justice system and the media that was reporting on it. Trump is drawing directly from the Nixon playbook. In William Barr, he\u2019s got his Roy Cohn now at Justice and has rid himself of investigators like former FBI director James Comey. And he is using Barr to manipulate and undermine the work of special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump admitted to his own Saturday night massacre \u2013 his firing of Comey \u2013 in an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt, on national TV and has used Twitter to undermine the FBI, the Department of Justice, the intelligence community, Congress and the so-called \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d the media. A look back at Clinton's impeachment reveals the GOP's searing hypocrisy So for those arguing that Democrats should cool it on investigations, I\u2019d argue that it was Congress\u2019 determination to get to the bottom of Watergate that exposed the pervasive corruption of the Nixon administration. Using both congressional contempt powers and the courts did nothing to hurt the Democrats in 1973-74, and I believe it will not hurt them now. That\u2019s because the Trump administration is using every power it has to keep information from the public. As a rule, Americans feel they have the right to see all the information before they make a judgment. That was clear in 1974 and I believe it is still true today. The intensity and determination, and rulings in court, eventually left President Nixon with only one political option: resign so as not to be removed. His support among Republicans remained strong until ultimately even the most stalwart Republican leaders could no longer brook his corruption. The Democrats not only didn\u2019t suffer a backlash, they saw unprecedented success during the next general election. I still believe the Democrats should not move to impeachment. There is no chance Republicans in the Senate, in the current environment, will do anything but find him not guilty. However, I also believe the risks of vigorously investigating Trump have very little political downside.  Both sides are now following the identical strategies pursued in 1973-74 \u2013 Republicans obstructing and Democrats investigating aggressively. We all know how that turned out.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In this weekly column \u201cCross-exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. The Mueller report is coming. Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that he was \u201cwell along\u201d in making redactions to the report, and expected to release the report by \u201cmid-April, if not sooner.\u201d But a big question remains: Just how much of Mueller\u2019s report will we see? Barr carves out several types of information that he might redact from it. On the uncontroversial end of the spectrum, Barr is in the process of redacting information about pending criminal investigations that Mueller has referred to other prosecutors \u2013 Barr\u2019s confirmation of continuing investigations here is significant in its own right \u2013 and sensitive intelligence materials. Such redactions are appropriate and necessary. Then things get trickier. Barr says he will remove \u201cinformation that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\u201d But he should not hide behind the fiction that the DOJ follows an \u201cindict or shut up\u201d policy; in fact, the DOJ has released extensive negative information about uncharged people in high-stakes cases including investigations of Hillary Clinton and the Ferguson Police Department.  And the \u201cindict or shut up\u201d theory should have no application to a sitting president who, under DOJ policy, should never be indicted purely by virtue of his position. The major redaction battle will be fought over grand jury materials. According to Barr, Mueller served over 2,800 subpoenas seeking testimony and documents; all that information qualifies as grand jury material. Remove that much evidence from the report and it could end up looking like Swiss cheese. What Mueller's probe has already revealed about Trump Typically, grand jury materials must remain secret. Barr states in the letter that he is in the process of identifying grand jury materials that \u201cby law cannot be made public.\u201d But grand jury materials can be made public, if Barr only cares to try. In fact, in 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr obtained permission from a federal judge to disclose grand jury materials. Barr has the ability to make the same motion here, and Rep. Jerry Nadler, Democratic chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has offered to work with Barr to request permission from the courts to release grand jury information. (Note how Starr seemed eager to disclose such materials, while Barr already seems to be finding reasons to suppress them. I wonder why.) Nadler also plans to authorize a House subpoena to obtain Mueller\u2019s full report, without any redactions. If the Department of Justice resists, we could end up in a legal battle pitting the legislative branch and its core oversight function against the executive branch. In the interest of transparency and public confidence in the Department of Justice, Barr should put away his redaction pen and disclose as much of Muller\u2019s report as possible. Anything less will raise one big question: What is Barr trying to hide? Ray (California): Doesn\u2019t Mueller have some unanswered questions? For example, the Supreme Court upheld a \u201cmystery subpoena\u201d to a foreign company. What happens to that? Mueller leaves behind important, unresolved cases and investigations. Michael Flynn still awaits sentencing, and Rick Gates continues to cooperate with prosecutors on \u201cseveral ongoing investigations.\u201d Roger Stone will stand trial in November, during which we should learn which \u201csenior Trump Campaign officials\u201d contacted Stone to \u201cinquire about future releases\u201d of hacked emails by Wikileaks. Then there\u2019s the subpoena that Mueller served on an unknown foreign-owned company, which challenged the subpoena\u2019s legality. The courts upheld the subpoena, and the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, requiring the mystery company to comply. Mueller also has prevailed thus far in a legal fight over a subpoena on Stone associate Andrew Miller. All of these open matters \u2013 and likely more that are not yet publicly known \u2013 will go to US Attorney\u2019s Offices for completion.  Barr stated to Congress that he is in the process of redacting from Mueller\u2019s report \u201cmaterial that could affect other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other Department offices.\u201d Indeed, a federal prosecutor in Washington DC last week confirmed that Mueller\u2019s grand jury was \u201ccontinuing robustly\u201d to investigate open matters. Perhaps most worrisome for Trump, Mueller previously referred the Michael Cohen investigation to the Southern District of New York, which now has a continuing probe into the Trump Organization and the inaugural committee. Mueller\u2019s departure does not mean his investigations go away; it means they go to other prosecutors to finish. Lisa (Connecticut):  Could Barr decide to remove parts of Mueller\u2019s report based on executive privilege? Executive privilege protects against disclosure of confidential communications between the President and his advisers. In his letter to Congress, Barr notes that Trump \u201chas stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.\u201d Barr\u2019s statement is ambiguous \u2013 perhaps intentionally. It could mean I will not submit the report to the White House and there will be no executive privilege redactions, or it could mean I will review the report myself and make redactions for executive privilege. Barr would pursue the latter scenario at the peril of his own credibility. Executive privilege belongs to the President, and it is not for Barr to assert it and do Trump\u2019s political bidding for him. Further, Trump does not even appear to have a winning executive privilege claim. As the Supreme Court held in its unanimous 1974 ruling in the Richard Nixon case, executive privilege protects national security secrets but is not a generalized shield against presidential liability or accountability. The stakes are high because many of the communications to which executive privilege might apply \u2013 internal White House conversations about firing (or potential firing) of James Comey or Jeff Sessions or Mueller, for example \u2013 go to the heart of the obstruction of justice question. If Barr redacts that evidence from the Mueller report, he will zip out some of the report\u2019s most important passages. Michael (California):  If a legal issue relating to Mueller\u2019s report goes to the Supreme Court, do you believe Chief Justice John Roberts will, as he seems to have done in the past, feel the weight of keeping the court above perceived political partisanship and side with the more liberal justices? How Barr took the political wind out of obstruction probe The Judicial Branch is the least political of our three branches of government. Federal judges are appointed, not elected, and once confirmed, they have lifetime tenure. That said, it would be naive to assume that federal judges function in a political vacuum. They come into the job with ideological viewpoints, which often are the subject of confirmation hearings. And public perception of a purely apolitical Supreme Court took a permanent hit when the court split 5-4, along straight ideological lines, in the Bush v. Gore decision, which ended the contested 2000 election. In late 2018, after President Trump lashed out at \u201cObama judges\u201d on the federal appeals court that ruled against his travel ban, Chief Justice Roberts took the extraordinary step of issuing a public statement rebuking the President:  \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges\u2026\u201d Chief Justice Roberts plainly understands the growing public concern about partisanship in the federal judiciary, and cares about remedying that perception. With the recent replacement of Justice Anthony Kennedy with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Chief Justice Roberts now sits between the conservative and liberal blocs of justices. While I do not believe Roberts would depart from his deeply held judicial principles to avoid an appearance of partisanship, I also think Roberts does not want to go down in history as the chief justice who presided over politicization of the court. Remember, Roberts was the unexpected swing vote upholding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and he could deliver another surprise if an issue related to Mueller\u2019s report comes before the Court. Harry (Canada): If collusion wasn\u2019t the reason that some Trump associates lied about meeting or having contacts with Russians (and risked going to jail), then why were they lying? Mueller convicted several Trump associates for lying to law enforcement or Congress about their contacts with Russians: Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, George Papadopoulos (and perjury charges remain pending against Roger Stone). Yes, people lie for a reason, and those reasons are almost always bad. The law recognizes this. At trials, judges instruct juries about \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d Essentially, this is the commonsense notion that, where a person lies, the jury can \u2013 but does not have to \u2013 assume he lied because he knew he was guilty of the offense. But those bad reasons are not necessarily criminal. Sometimes people lie for political reasons or personal reasons \u2013 or for a combination of reasons. I suspect a complex combination of bad motives drove each of the now-convicted Trump associates to lie about their contacts with Russia: Fear that the Russian contacts might have been criminal, mixed with a desire to avoid the political repercussions (for themselves and the campaign) of those contacts. As with so many things, we will know more once we see Mueller\u2019s report. Nicholas (California): If a sitting president cannot be indicted under DOJ policy, can he be indicted when he leaves office? Would the statute of limitations freeze while he is in office or is there a way to extend the statute of limitations? Barr's letter is not Mueller's report While DOJ policy counsels against indicting a sitting president, a president can be indicted once out of office. But every crime carries a statute of limitations \u2013 a time limit, starting from the day a person commits a crime, within which criminal charges must be brought. For most federal crimes, the statute of limitations is five years. So if Trump leaves office in January 2021, a five-year statute of limitations would prohibit criminal charges for any conduct occurring before January 2016; if he leaves office in January 2025, then the statute of limitations would bar charges on anything he did before January 2020. There is, however, an important exception. In some instances, federal law permits \u201ctolling\u201d of the statute of limitations \u2013  essentially a pause on the countdown clock. Tolling happens, for example, when a defendant is a fugitive or during the pendency of a request from the United States to a foreign country for evidence. While the issue has never been decided in court, I believe prosecutors would have a strong legal argument that the statute of limitations should be tolled while the President is in office. Prosecutors might make the unusual argument that being president is, for legal purposes, the same as being a fugitive: In both cases, the subject cannot be charged and apprehended, through no fault of the prosecution. Essentially, prosecutors might argue, the President \u2013 by virtue of his position \u2013 hides from the law, in plain sight.  1. Will we finally get our first glimpse of the Mueller report \u2013 not merely Barr\u2019s summary \u2013 this week? 2. Will Nadler follow through with his subpoena to the DOJ for the entire Mueller report, potentially setting up a legal showdown, or will he wait to see what Barr discloses by mid-April first? 3. Will the White House continue to stonewall congressional requests for information relating to background checks and security clearances for Jared Kushner and others? If so, what steps will Congress take in response?",

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. This week\u2019s New York Times report that President Donald Trump asked then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to get US Attorney Geoffrey Berman to un-recuse himself and take charge of the Michael Cohen investigation evokes an old school, Nixonian attempt to obstruct justice. If the reporting is accurate, Trump\u2019s actions make his intent clear: Get my hand-picked appointee \u2013 Trump personally interviewed Berman before he was appointed to run the Southern District of New York \u2013 back on the Cohen case to limit the damage done to me. I\u2019ve charged and tried obstruction of justice cases. If this isn\u2019t an attempt to obstruct, then I don\u2019t know what is. Trump has offered only the weakest of defenses: The conversation with Whitaker didn\u2019t happen, and the report is \u201cfake news.\u201d (Note the pause in this video before Trump answers; prosecutors or poker players might call this a \u201ctell.) That defense collapses under scrutiny. First, Whitaker has essentially admitted he did speak with Trump about the Southern District of New York case. Under questioning in Congress \u2013 stemming from CNN\u2019s exclusive reporting that Trump discussed that investigation with Whitaker \u2013 Whitaker forcefully denied he had spoken to Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation but bobbed, weaved and ultimately declined to answer when asked if he and Trump had discussed the Southern District of New York case. Common sense: When a witness strongly denies he discussed one thing but dodges on the other, that means he discussed the other thing. Don Lemon: What is President Trump trying to hide? Also, Trump happens to have done the exact same thing he reportedly tried to do to Berman \u2013 convince him to un-recuse and take charge of a criminal matter to limit potential damage to Trump \u2013 to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump repeatedly and publicly berated Sessions, calling him \u201cscared stiff and Missing in Action,\u201d retweeting a commentator who referred to Sessions\u2019 recusal as \u201can unforced betrayal,\u201d and declaring that Sessions should un-recuse and \u201cstop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now.\u201d Trump tried to bully Sessions into getting back into the Russia case to limit damage done to Trump; is it any wonder Trump tried to do the exact same thing to the Southern District of New York? Sandra, Massachusetts: Can Congress subpoena Mueller to testify as to the report and to any interference his office has experienced \u2013 particularly if new Attorney General William Barr refuses to make the full report public? Many readers suggested this as a possible recourse if some or all of the Mueller report is kept out of public view. Yes, Congress \u2013 almost certainly the Democratic-controlled House \u2013 could subpoena Mueller and ask what he learned during the investigation. However, Mueller would face limits on what he could talk about publicly. He cannot disclose classified or sensitive national security materials. Prosecutors also are prohibited from publicly discussing grand jury material, meaning information or testimony obtained through a subpoena. However, there are ways around this prohibition; former Bill Clinton independent counsel Kenneth Starr obtained court permission to disclose grand jury materials, for example. And Trump might assert executive privilege to block Mueller from testifying about Trump\u2019s discussions with his advisers. Though, as discussed below, I doubt Trump would prevail legally. So, while Mueller\u2019s live testimony would be limited in some respects, it remains an important fail-safe if Trump or Barr quashes the special counsel\u2019s written report altogether. And the pure drama of Mueller taking the stand in Congress would be unparalleled. Andrea, New York: What will happen to the Mueller probe and all the new congressional investigations if Trump invokes executive privilege? Executive privilege is not a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. It does, however, enable the President and perhaps others to avoid answering questions or producing evidence in response to a subpoena. The idea is that the president should be able to speak freely and confidentially with his advisers without worrying about those discussions ever becoming public \u2013 as with other legal privileges between attorney and client or doctor and patient. I expect executive privilege could still become a flashpoint in the Russia investigation. Trump and his team already have suggested he might invoke executive privilege to avoid answering direct questions from Mueller, to resist congressional subpoenas and to redact portions of Mueller\u2019s written report. The issue could end up before the Supreme Court, as it did in 1974 in United States v. Nixon. The court unanimously ruled against President Richard Nixon, who argued that executive privilege protected him from having to turn over White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor. The court held that executive privilege protects national security and military secrets but does not provide a generalized shield in criminal matters. Given the Nixon precedent, I think Trump will fail if he tries to exert executive privilege for anything other than sensitive national security communications. While the Nixon decision arose from a dispute over a grand jury subpoena, the precedent likely would also apply to congressional testimony. Mueller\u2019s probe may be ending, but as congressional inquiries continue, executive privilege is likely to an ongoing issue. Michael, Missouri: I\u2019m not a lawyer, but can Roger Stone get away with just apologizing? In 14 years as a prosecutor, I saw defendants do reckless things while released on bail awaiting trial. But I\u2019ve never seen a defendant do anything quite as blatant as Stone publicly posting on social media a photo of Judge Amy Berman Jackson with rifle cross hairs next to her head and accusing the judge of presiding over a \u201cshow trial.\u201d The dubious characters who surround Trump In other words, I doubt he will be able to get away with it. Stone committed new federal crimes by threatening the judge and obstructing justice. Stone might argue he did not intend the post as a threat \u2013 his mealy-mouthed, heavily lawyered, passive-voiced \u201cNotice of Apology\u201d lamely makes that argument \u2013 but any rational person sees an image of cross hairs as a threat. Apparently, Jackson does, too; she has summoned Stone to court to consider whether to revoke his bail based on a violation of bail conditions (which include a prohibition on committing new crimes) or to broaden the gag order that Jackson issued Friday. Stone grew up in a political underworld where you can slide by with cheap shots and flimsy denials. But the criminal courts are different; accountability is enforced. Stone\u2019s dangerous actions pose a threat to the judge, the justice system and his own liberty. John, Tennessee: Since Paul Manafort is being prosecuted and sentenced to prison for lying to the FBI, isn\u2019t Andrew McCabe subject to the same since he has been found to have lied to the FBI as well? In a February 2018 report, the Department of Justice inspector general found that former acting FBI Director McCabe \u201clacked candor\u201d in responding to questioning about his involvement in anonymous leaks to the media; those leaks rebutted an incorrect narrative that McCabe had terminated an investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. In March 2018, Sessions, then attorney general, fired McCabe, based on the inspector general\u2019s findings. McCabe might be charged with federal crimes, including false statements and obstruction of justice. McCabe has claimed publicly that he did not intentionally lie but rather was confused by investigators\u2019 questioning and distracted by other events swirling around the FBI. I find that defense hard to believe. The inspector general found that McCabe \u201clacked candor\u201d not once \u2013 when maybe he had a bad day or was out of sorts \u2013 but three separate times on three separate dates, all while under oath. McCabe\u2019s statements were straightforward \u2013 he falsely denied authorizing or being the source of leaks to the media about a recent and exceptionally high-profile case. That\u2019s not the kind of thing one forgets or misremembers or misstates. Ultimately, a prosecutor will weigh all the facts and determine if a criminal prosecution of McCabe is appropriate and warranted. Mueller is not handling the McCabe investigation, but he has indicted Manafort, Stone, Michael Flynn, Cohen, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos for allegedly making false statements to federal investigators or Congress. McCabe, too, lied to federal investigators (repeatedly), and it is hard to see a meaningful distinction between his case and the ones Mueller has charged. Joe, Massachusetts: What is the rationale for the Department of Justice counseling against indicting a sitting president for a crime? I thought that no American was above the law. Robert Mueller's report is coming whether Trump likes it or not The primary rationale for the Justice Department\u2019s current policy against indicting a sitting president is that it could effectively cripple the executive branch: \u201cTo wound (the President) by a criminal proceeding is to hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.\u201d The department\u2019s policy also considers the possibility of indicting the president while in office and delaying trial until his term ends, but concludes that \u201can indictment hanging over the President while he remains in office would damage the institution of the Presidency virtually to the same extent as an actual conviction.\u201d For those who worry that Justice Department policy places a sitting president above the law, remember two things. First, a president can be impeached, removed from office and potentially indicted or indicted after the natural end of his term (subject to statute of limitations). Second, the department\u2019s policy acknowledges that there is no clear answer in the Constitution \u2013  \u201cneither the text nor the history of the Constitution ultimately provided dispositive guidance\u201d \u2013 and there is healthy disagreement among scholars about the issue. Molly, Georgia: In a tweet, Trump called the 25th Amendment \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Is it even possible for part of the Constitution to be unconstitutional? Trump, quoting Alan Dershowitz, tweeted that trying \u201cto use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing.\u201d By definition, something that is part of the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional. Trump's outrageous effort to undermine his investigators However, I think Trump meant that it would have been an abuse of the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. I agree with that. The 25th Amendment applies not to a president who acts badly or rashly or irresponsibly, but rather to a president who is \u201cunable to discharge the duties of his office.\u201d The amendment passed in 1967, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when concerns ran high about contingency plans if a president was grievously wounded and incapacitated. McCabe and others at the FBI might have genuinely believed Trump was compromised by his potential ties to Russia. The proper constitutional remedy, however, would not be removal through the 25th Amendment but rather investigation and, if warranted, impeachment. McCabe and the FBI acted appropriately and wisely when they initiated counterintelligence and obstruction of justice investigations of Trump in 2017; those investigations were, and remain, necessary to determine the full extent of Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. Our Constitution provides various mechanisms to hold a president accountable, and here I think that an investigation and potential impeachment (depending on the findings) are a better fit than the 25th Amendment. Bethany, Georgia: There is so little talk of the immunity granted to Allen Weisselberg, Trump\u2019s longtime chief financial officer. Do you believe Weisselberg\u2019s cooperation has led to the recent subpoenas to the Trump inaugural committee and interview requests with the Trump Organization? We haven\u2019t heard much about Weisselberg since he received immunity from the Southern District of New York, but don\u2019t sleep on him.  The Southern District immunized Weisselberg \u2013 meaning essentially it agreed not to charge him if he provided full and truthful testimony \u2013 in relation to hush money payments to two women, potentially in violation of campaign finance laws. After Weisselberg entered the immunity deal with the Southern District of New York, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations relating to those payments. The Cohen charging papers also detail the involvement of Trump Organization \u201cExecutive-1\u201d and \u201cExecutive-2,\u201d both of whom eventually could face campaign finance charges. More broadly, Weisselberg kept the books for Trump for decades and reportedly \u201cknows where all the financial bodies are buried.\u201d If Weisselberg continues to cooperate, he could give the Southern District of New York a guided tour of decades\u2019 worth of financial and potentially other malfeasance by the Trump Organization.  1)  Will Mueller send his report to Barr next week, as reportedly expected, and what will Barr do with it from there? 2)  Will Sen. Lindsey Graham follow through on his vow to hold hearings on the FBI\u2019s consideration of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump? And, if so, what more will we learn about the early days of the Russia investigation? 3)  When Cohen testifies publicly in the House Intelligence Committee next Wednesday, what will the committee and public learn?",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Few American presidents ever have experienced as much legal turmoil in one year as Donald Trump did in 2018.  The past year brought a drumbeat of blockbuster revelations from special counsel Robert Mueller, but 2018 could end up as just a brisk warmup for what\u2019s to come in 2019.  Buckle up. As a reminder of just how much has changed, here\u2019s what the landscape looked like one year ago today: \u2013 Trump\u2019s longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had a clean rap sheet.  Cohen now has pleaded guilty to nine federal felonies \u2013 including campaign finance crimes, in which both Cohen and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) implicated Trump.  Cohen will begin serving a three-year prison sentence in March 2019. \u2013 Trump\u2019s former campaign chair Paul Manafort was a free man who had been charged but not convicted of any crime.  Now he is a convicted felon who has been in federal prison for six months, and might stay there for the rest of his life. \u2013 No Russians had been charged with any crime relating to the 2016 election.  Since then, Mueller has charged 13 Russian nationals for allegedly using social media to conduct \u201cinformation warfare against the United States\u201d and 12 Russian intelligence officers for allegedly hacking the servers of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and others in an effort to help Trump win the 2016 election. \u2013 Jeff Sessions was attorney general and Don McGahn was White House counsel and the Republicans had a stranglehold on both houses of Congress. \u2013 The general public had never heard of Manafort\u2019s $18,500 python jacket,  \u201cSmocking Guns,\u201d \u201cIndividual-1\u201d or Matthew Whitaker. Five things even Trump critics can give him credit for this Christmas Mueller is far from done.  2019 promises to be another cataclysmic year for Trump and his inner circle.  Keeping in mind an immutable truth of this investigation \u2013 Mueller knows more than we do \u2013 here\u2019s a look ahead at what to expect. Several former members of the Trump campaign and administration soon will learn how long they will spend behind bars. \u2013 Paul Manafort.  All Manafort did in 2018 was get thrown in jail for witness tampering, get convicted at trial, plead guilty to even more crimes, and then get caught allegedly lying to Mueller in a failed effort at a cooperation deal.  Rough year. Manafort now faces a hearing on January 25, 2019 about his alleged lies to Mueller, which should be the last stop before sentencing.  Manafort is 69 years old, and likely faces a sentence that will keep him behind bars for most or all of his remaining life \u2013 unless Trump makes good on his suggestion of a potential pardon. \u2013 Michael Flynn.  Flynn likely walked into court for sentencing in December expecting to leave a free man; Flynn\u2019s own lawyers and Mueller agreed that he deserved a non-incarceratory sentence, given his substantial cooperation with prosecutors.  Not so fast. Judge Emmet Sullivan laid into Flynn, rejecting the suggestion that Flynn had been set up by the FBI and wondering aloud if he might have committed treason.  Flynn now faces an uncertain future. Judge Sullivan gave Flynn until March 13, 2019 to update the court on his cooperation.  The message to Flynn is clear: either prove your worth to Mueller, or you\u2019re going to jail. \u2013 Rick Gates.  Gates \u2013 Manafort\u2019s right-hand man turned star prosecution witness at trial \u2013 also faces sentencing.  Mueller has confirmed that Gates\u2019s cooperation is ongoing, and the parties will update the judge by January 15.  Gates likely will learn his fate later in 2019. Rep. Himes: Concerned about Stone's honesty \u2013 Roger Stone.  Stone, a longtime Trump associate, has said he is \u201cprepared\u201d to be indicted by Mueller.  Stone \u2013 who, incidentally, has a large tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back and whose motto is \u201cadmit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack\u201d \u2013 remains characteristically defiant. He told an interviewer on Meet the Press that Mueller \u201cmay seek to conjure up some extraneous crime, pertaining to my business, or maybe not even pertaining to the 2016 election.\u201d  Stone could face charges for allegedly conspiring with Russian hackers, Wikileaks and the Trump campaign to obtain and distribute stolen e-mails and, potentially, for lying to Congress about those contacts. \u2013 Jerome Corsi.  Corsi also has said he expects to be indicted for lying to Mueller or a grand jury about his role as an intermediary between Stone and Wikileaks regarding the publication of hacked e-mails.  Corsi steadfastly has denied criminal liability, claiming that Mueller tried to force him to \u201csign a lie\u201d and defying Mueller to try to \u201cput me in prison the rest of my life.\u201d  We will learn whether Mueller takes him up on it. \u2013 Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner.  President Trump reportedly is worried that his son will be indicted, though he has strenuously denied any concern over his son\u2019s conduct.  Donald Trump Jr. and Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Kushner could face potential legal jeopardy on several fronts:  (1) conspiracy to obtain foreign election aid for participating in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians offering dirt on Clinton, or lying to Congress about President Trump\u2019s knowledge of that meeting; (2) lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow in 2016 \u2013 the same crime for which Cohen already has been convicted; and (3) campaign finance violations, if Trump Jr. or Kushner are the \u201cExecutive-1\u201d or \u201cExecutive-2\u201d, referenced in Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, who \u2013 he said authorized and facilitated illegal hush money payments. Trump Jr.: I'm not worried about going to jail Both Trump Jr. and President Trump have denied any criminal culpability arising from these incidents, but Mueller will have the final say. For Democrats, taking control of the House of Representatives comes with the all-important power to issue subpoenas and conduct investigations.  Incoming House committee chairs, including Adam Schiff (Intelligence), Jerry Nadler (Judiciary), Elijah Cummings (Oversight and Government Reform) and others, made no effort to play it cool, publicly announcing their planned Trump-centric investigations the day after midterms, even before all election results had been tallied. These House investigations would open up a new front, with different rules, for Trump.  While Mueller carries plenty of punch, much of his work is done out of public view and subject to strict rules of grand jury secrecy and criminal procedure.  The House, however, can hold public hearings, on fairly short notice, with little limitation on substance.  The Democrats\u2019 hit list includes Russian election interference (though they would be well-advised to steer clear of Mueller\u2019s ongoing criminal probe), Trump\u2019s tax returns and personal finances, payments of hush money and the appointment of Whitaker as acting attorney general. Schiff may try to force Mueller report release While House Democrats now wield a powerful new tool, don\u2019t expect the White House to accede to every demand from Schiff and company.  Trump and his legal team could take various tacks, ranging from challenging the scope and relevance of congressional subpoenas to invoking executive privilege to simply defying Congress.  This will not go down without a legal battle. The special counsel regulations set out a two-step process for Mueller\u2019s final report.  First, Mueller must \u201cprovide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel.\u201d  The attorney general, in turn, may decide whether and how to release the information in the report, or some portion of it, to Congress and the public. This seems straightforward on its face, but expect a pitched legal and political battle.  Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u2019s attorney, already has declared that he is preparing (as Trump put it) a \u201cmajor Counter-Report\u201d and that the President  reserved \u201cthe right to object to the public disclosure of information that might be covered by executive privilege,\u201d as Jeffrey Toobin reported in September in the New Yorker. That argument seems legally dubious, but there is also little legal precedent \u2013 and the Supreme Court\u2019s newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, has expressed a strong view that the President should not be subject to normal legal process. Further complicating matters is uncertainty about who will be attorney general by the time Mueller issues his report, and whether that person \u2013 Whitaker or Trump\u2019s announced nominee, William Barr \u2013 will allow the report to see the light of day. Trump lashed out at Whitaker after Cohen news Before their announced appointments, both Whitaker and Barr criticized Mueller\u2019s investigative and legal tactics, raising questions about their impartiality.  Whitaker\u2019s recent decision not to recuse himself despite the advice of ethics experts, and recent meetings during which Trump reportedly \u201clashed out\u201d at Whitaker for allowing the SDNY to implicate Trump in campaign finance crimes, only add to the concern about the independence of the Department of Justice moving forward.  (Trump denied that he \u201clashed out\u201d at Whitaker, but did not deny that he had spoken to Whitaker about the case). Mueller plays strictly by the rules, but he is nobody\u2019s fool and is unlikely to allow his findings to be improperly suppressed.  He already has made public significant details about his investigative findings through his court filings, and he likely will continue to inform the public of his work through indictments, plea agreements, and sentencing memos. The newest player in the mix is Schiff, who suddenly carries a heavy stick as the incoming chair of the House Intelligence Committee.  Schiff already has made clear that he will fight any effort to bury Mueller\u2019s findings.  We could see a free-for-all right out of professional wrestling:  Mueller vs. the attorney general vs. congress vs. the White House.  It would be a legal brawl befitting what promises to be an explosive year in 2019.",

            "article_content": "A Mississippi prosecutor excluded many black jurors from trials for more than 25 years, a lawsuit alleges. Since District Attorney Doug Evans took office in 1992, \u201che and his assistants have employed a policy, custom, or use of discriminatorily striking black jurors with peremptory challenges,\u201d according to the class action suit brought forth by four black residents and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) and the MacArthur Justice Center, representing Attala County\u2019s NAACP branch. The plaintiffs are asking for a judge to order Evans to stop using challenges as a way to remove black jurors. Peremptory challenges allow lawyers to strike a prospective juror without giving a specific reason. Black jurors were 4.4 times more likely to be struck down than white jurors, the lawsuit claims. And in cases where the defendant was black, the suit says, Evans\u2019 strike rate against black jurors was \u201ceven more pronounced.\u201d Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that a black death row inmate in Mississippi should get a new trial after Evans engaged in unconstitutional racial discrimination when turning away black jurors from the panels. The inmate, Curtis Flowers, was tried five times for the 1996 murder of four people inside a furniture store. A conviction stuck after his sixth trial in 2010 and he was sentenced to death. \u201cThe State\u2019s relentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals strongly suggests that the state wanted to try Flowers before a jury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an all-white jury,\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the June decision. One of the black residents suing Evans was in the jury pool for Flowers\u2019 third trial, the lawsuit says. She was one of 15 black jurors who were dismissed. Without the court\u2019s intervention, the lawsuit claims, Evans will ignore the Supreme Court ruling and continue discriminatory practices \u201cnot just in Curtis Flowers\u2019 case, but in every case in the Fifth Circuit Court District in which Black citizens appear for jury service.\u201d CNN has reached out to Evans for comment but has not yet gotten a response. \u201cIt is hard to find a more egregious pattern of a prosecutor\u2019s office treating Black jurors like second-class citizens and rigging the jury system,\u201d Chris Kemmitt, senior counsel at LDF, said in a statement. Jury duty and voting are the most \u201csubstantial\u201d opportunities residents have to participate in the democratic process, the suit says. The prosecutor\u2019s practices strike \u201cat the heart of the constitutional guarantee that all citizens may participate in self-government regardless of race,\u201d it says. But even before he was elected into his position, the lawsuit alleges Evans made two stops during his 1991 campaign that \u201cforeshadowed hostility towards African Americans.\u201d The first one was at a Council of Conservative Citizens meeting, the lawsuit says. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the Council of Conservative Citizens a \u201ccrudely white supremacist group,\u201d and the group\u2019s statement of principles on its website outlines an opposition to \u201call efforts to mix the races of mankind\u201d and argues the United States\u2019 population \u201cshould remain European in their composition and character.\u201d The Anti-Defamation League says the organization came from the \u201canti-integrationist White Citizens Councils\u201d of the 1950s and \u201960s. Evans also showed up to the Black Hawk Political Rally, the suit says, which was sponsored by the Council of Conservative Citizens. The rally was a \u201cfundraiser to help pay for white children in Carroll County to attend a private all-white school and evade a federal desegregation order,\u201d the suit claims. Since winning that election, Evans\u2019 office has prosecuted more than 400 criminal trials, the suit says. In 225 of them, the lawsuit says, 29% of jurors struck were white, and 71% were black. \u201cThe statistical disparity in the cases from 1992 through 2017 is inexplicable on non-racial grounds,\u201d the suit says. \u201cAbsent intervention from this court, Evans will continue to pursue the same discriminatory policy, custom, or usage.\u201d Correction: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the strike rate of black jurors by the Mississippi prosecutor cited in the lawsuit. CNN\u2019s Chris Boyette, Ariane de Vogue and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",
