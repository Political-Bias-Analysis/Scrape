            "article_content": "Applicability of Anti-Injunction Act will be first question before justices, on March 26 Provision requiring Americans to have health insurance will be the key argument Lawyers will argue whether rulings on mandate's constitutionality affect entire law States challenging law are saying it coerces them to expand Medicaid The Supreme Court has carved out a week in late March to hold oral arguments in perhaps its biggest case in a decade \u2013 the sweeping healthcare reform law championed by President Obama. The court announced Monday it will hear 5\u00bd hours of arguments spread over three days March 26-28. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA) was signed into law March 23, 2010, passed by a Democratic congressional majority with the support of the president. It has about 2700 pages and contains 450 some provisions. A ruling from the court is expected by late June and regardless of the outcome, will become a major issue in a presidential election year. The largest and broadest legal challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act comes from a joint filing by 26 states, led by Florida. It was that series of appeals the high court had accepted for review. At issue is whether the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d section \u2013 requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties \u2013 is an improper exercise of federal authority. The states also say that if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must be also go. Joining Florida in the challenge are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Four issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court: Anti-Injunction Act First, the court on March 26 will consider whether those challenging the law be barred from making any legal or constitutional claims until the individual mandate actually goes into effect in 2014. The AIA \u2013 in place since the 19th century \u2013 bars claimants from asking for a refund on a tax until that tax has been collected and paid. Judges in two federal appeals courts have made that argument, which would effectively stop the current legal fight in its tracks. Citing that law might give the court a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year. The majority could decide the political branches can best resolve the conflicts, at least for now, or that the matter can be handled after the November elections. Some court watchers have called this the health care \u201csleeper issue.\u201d It could potentially delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years. Individual mandate The court will hear two hours of arguments on this most key issue on March 27. This provision requires nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014, or face financial penalties. May the federal government, under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause, regulate economic \u201cinactivity\u201d? Three federal appeals courts have found the PPACA to be constitutional, while another has said it is not, labeling it \u201cbreathtaking in its expansive scope.\u201d That \u201ccircuit split\u201d all but assured the Supreme Court would step in and decide the matter. The Florida-led coalition of say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a \u201cproduct\u201d they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not \u201cchoose\u201d to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. Severability This is the \u201cdomino effect\u201d issue, and the court will hear 90 minutes of argument on this aspect on March 28. If the individual mandate section is ruled unconstitutional, must the entire law collapse as well? A federal judge in Florida had ruled as much in February: \u201cBecause the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire Act must be declared void.\u201d But a federal appeals court overruled on the severability question, while upholding the individual mandate\u2019s unconstitutionality. Opponents of the law say the individual mandate is crucial to the overall law, since it is the main funding mechanism for the expansion of a range of other programs. This may be the one question on which the justices will ultimately agree in favor of the government. Medicaid \u2018coercion\u2019 Can states be forced by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse? The court will devote an hour to that question on March 28. The 28 GOP-led states say the new law\u2019s significant expansion of the social safety net unconstitutionally \u201ccoerces\u201d state governments. That program is administered by the states with a combination of federal and state money, currently requiring coverage only for poor children and their parents or caretakers, adults with disabilities, and poor individuals over age 65. The \u201ccoercion\u201d issue was surprisingly added to the healthcare debate by the justices. Both sides of the issue agree what the high court decides on this question could have monumental implications for the regulatory ability of the federal government to set long-term national policy goals in areas like the environment, education, and the workplace. Some states have long complained their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201clay and collect \u2026 taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States\u201d and to \u201cregulate commerce\u2026 among the several states.\u201d Such authority has long been broadly interpreted, including when imposing conditions on recipients, including individuals and states. No federal court has ever ruled states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions or strings attached to federal funds. The Supreme Court in 1987 affirmed that congressional discretion. The PPACA\u2019s Medicaid changes \u2013 beginning in 2014 \u2013 would make millions of additional Americans eligible for benefits, by raising the income level they earn and still qualify. That would include all adults, up to 133% of the federal poverty line. The tricky question is that states are not forced to agree to the law\u2019s incremental Medicaid increases, spread out over six years. But the states say abandoning their participation as a result would be a financial, social, and political catastrophe\u2013 one which they cannot realistically foresee. Their needy citizens rely on Medicaid, states argue, but the law\u2019s expansion of the program could cripple state budgets, currently on average about 20-percent. That would threaten other state spending priorities. So the long-standing fight over \u201cfederalism\u201d and the leverage the national government wields over states may soon reach epic levels with a high court decision either strengthening \u2013 or limiting \u2013 congressional authority on this and potentially a host of other regulatory areas. The cases are Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida (11-398); NFIB v. Sebelius (11-393); and Florida v. HHS (11-400).",

            "article_content": "By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN In America (CNN) \u2013 In 10th grade English at Los Angeles\u2019 Grover Cleveland High School, Danielle Taklender\u2019s students read the book \u201cLuna\u201d by Julie Anne Peters.\u00a0 It\u2019s a story about a transgender teen. Taklender has been teaching\u00a0the book\u00a0for seven years without any fanfare or push back. It\u2019s getting noticed now as her school district takes the lead in developing a plan to comply with the first state law mandating lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history and social science curricula. The California law, which takes effect in January, stops short of dictating how schools are to comply and leaves that up to the districts and schools themselves to figure out. Taklender uses \u201cLuna\u201d to expose students to new vocabulary and different ways of thinking about pronouns. The students discuss gender identity versus sexual orientation, as well as gender roles in literature.\u00a0 Taklender said she teaches this book the same way she teaches every other book. She says the only negative feedback she has\u00a0run into was a parent who once requested an alternate assignment after the class finished reading the book. \u201cNo students ever say they changed their sexual orientation because of it,\u201d Taklender said. The new law, called the California Fair Education Act, also requires schools teach about the\u00a0contributions of Native Americans, and people with disabilities. It also bans instructional materials that adversely reflect on a person due to their sexual orientation. The requirements are actually an expansion to the education code already in existence, which requires lesson plans to include various ethnic groups. But it is\u00a0not without controversy. Some opponents have religious objections, others say it\u2019s part of sex education and belongs at home not in schools.\u00a0 Others simply don\u2019t want this taught to their children. So far, opposition efforts to repeal the law, which passed last summer, have failed. There are currently at least five initiative measures awaiting review by the attorney general that could make their way on the ballot for next year\u2019s election, but it\u2019s too late to stop the law that takes effect next month. If any of the ballot measures pass, they will\u00a0undo the curriculum that is already in place. Although individual teachers, like Taklender, have innovated LGBT studies, there aren\u2019t any system-wide models for districts to duplicate, said Jill Marcellus, a spokeswoman for the Gay-Straight Alliance Network. The Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network\u2019s 2009 National School Climate Survey found that about 13% of students were taught in a positive way about lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people in any of their classes. Scott Hirschfeld, director of curriculum at the Anti-Defamation League, said kids can go from kindergarten through 12th grade without ever learning about an LGBT person. \u201cThey are really getting an incomplete history,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that in most schools this is not a standard part of curriculum.\u201d In California, many schools have taken a wait-and-see approach, but not the Los Angeles Unified School District. In September, they set a 60-day deadline to develop a new curriculum. This was added to a resolution for affirmation of the district\u2019s anti-bullying measures to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The change isn\u2019t much different than in 2004, when the districts had to update health materials to address gender and sexuality, said Judy Chiasson, program coordinator for Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s Office of Human Relations, Diversity and Equity. At the time, the district had to create its own material, she said, because there wasn\u2019t anything similar out there. The district has reviewed what is already working in some of its classrooms.\u00a0 Educators have also looked at\u00a0materials by groups including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, University of California Los Angeles and University of Southern California. Those materials are the basis of a draft implementation plan for Los Angeles schools that is currently under review by the district Superintendent, a spokeswoman said. In the meantime, at Downtown Magnets High School in Los Angeles, Daniel Jocz\u2019s\u00a0eleventh grade history students continue to discuss lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.\u00a0The subject has been part of\u00a0Jocz\u2019s lesson plans since he started teaching seven years ago. Some days, that means a discussion about language:\u00a0the\u00a0negative use of the word \u2018gay\u2019 or\u00a0using \u2018guys\u2019 to describe women.\u00a0\u00a0His students\u00a0will often compare and contrast the use of\u00a0 these words with racial slurs. The students have also looked at case studies that compare the 1955 murder of 14-year-old African-American Emmett Till in Mississippi\u00a0with the 1998 murder of gay Wyoming college student, Matthew Shepard. \u201cThere are parallels between the gay situation and the civil rights movement,\u201d Jocz said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t include it as part of the narrative, you are ignoring it. You have to acknowledge it.\u201d Every generation has altered the way history is taught in schools, New York University history and education Professor Jonathan Zimmerman said. In the 1920s, it was the Irish, in the 1950s and 1960s, it was African-Americans and in the 1970s, it was Latinos. \u201cThere was a time when history books only had white guys,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cOver time, successive groups fought to have their story become part of the main story.\u201d Adding lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender studies is no different, he said. But schools must be careful not to just celebrate the group \u2013 they need to address tough questions and do some hard thinking. For example, he said, sending soldiers to fight for freedom for others while denying gay freedom in the military. \u201cWe need to think about why we\u2019re including them and what the purpose of these stories is in the first place,\u201d Zimmerman said. Which is why schools are looking at Taklender\u2019s English class and Jocz\u2019s history class.\u00a0 They are still trying to learn how this generation\u2019s history will be taught. Taklender and Jocz say they are just doing their jobs. \u201cEven though I knew it was revolutionary,\u201d Taklender said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u201d",

Verveer said Tunisia, with its long history of women\u2019s rights enshrined in its constitution, and strong middle class shows great promise. With its first election recently since the revolution in which close to a quarter of the seats in Parliament were won by women, Verveer said it would be interesting to see the role women play in pushing the Tunisia forward. On the other hand, Egypt is \u201cextremely complicated and worrisome,\u201d Verveer said, with no women included on the committee that drafted Egypt\u2019s transitional constitutional declaration, and only one female member serving in the cabinet. Verveer also pointed out that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has not appointed any female governors, and said some conservative and political forces are calling for a rollback on women\u2019s rights in the more open political environment. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, expressed concern for the rights of religious minorities in predominantly Muslim societies. \u201cCertainly, if women cannot freely worship and are being threatened with murder their human rights are not being duly respected,\u201d he said, and questioned the role of women in Libya in light of recent calls by Libya\u2019s National Transitional Council to enact Islamic law in the country. While Verveer noted the NTC has said they have no intention of establishing an Islamic theocracy, \u201cvigilance is critical, speaking out against violations is critical\u201d in ensuring the rights of women and minorities are respected in this time of transition she said. \u201cThis moment of change presents a great strategic opportunity for the United States,\u201d Deputy Assistant Secretary Tamara Wittes told the committee. With the implementation of democracy and universal rights, Wittes said the rising Arab population of young men and women can push back against the narrative of extremists in their societies. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, R-New Hampshire inquired about but what kind of \u201cbuy in\u201d the men in Arab Spring countries are giving to equal rights for women? \u201cIt\u2019s checkered,\u201d Verveer said. \u201cNo good cause for women happens without the good men,\u201d and working with those who understand that unless women are part of the political and economic process, their countries will be set back she said. The United States, which along with states like Iran and Somalia, has yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, should do so, said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. She said repressive governments could use that fact as a pretext to not live up to their own obligations under it. The U.N.-sponsored treaty has languished in the U.S. Senate since its adoption in 1979.",

A growing number of voters , 50% compared to 44% in March, trust Obama to solve the nation\u2019s problems while the percentage of those with faith in congressional Republicans is slipping, according to a CNN/ORC International Poll. CNN Poll: President\u2019s approval nearing 50% For the Obama team, the poll numbers seem to validate the president\u2019s fall and winter strategy: Intone the jobs message like a mantra while squaring off against a do-nothing Congress and congressional Republicans in particular. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for an increasingly dysfunctional Congress to do its job. Where they won\u2019t act, I will,\u201d the president told a Las Vegas audience in October. Congress has accomplished a few things, passing trade bills and a tax credit for unemployed veterans. But thanks to repeated failed votes on elements of the jobs bill and  leaving town for the holidays with a payroll tax extension unresolved, the lasting image is one of inaction. McCain: Payroll tax cut showdown \u2018harming\u2019 the GOP Call it a self-inflicted wound. When the president began the jobs push with his speech to Congress on September 8, his approval rating was at 43%. The new CNN/ORC Poll shows it now at 49%. That\u2019s the highest it has been since Osama Bin Laden was killed and up 5 points since November. What\u2019s happened in a month? On December 6, the president doubled down on his jobs message with a speech in Kansas in which he promised  to work toward an economy that promotes fairness and opportunity for all Americans. \u201cI believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share and when everyone plays by the same rules. \u2026 They\u2019re American values, and we have to reclaim them,\u201d he said. Boehner: 'I need the president to help' Meanwhile, Congress has failed to pass an extension of a payroll tax cut, which could cost $1,000 a year for an average family and affects about 160 million Americans. Obama calls House to vote on extension The president\u2019s campaign aides also see the poll numbers as a reaction to a contentious Republican primary. \u201cThese numbers will go up and down. But the debates over the last few months have clearly had an impact,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, Obama 2012 deputy campaign manager. \u201cOn one side they\u2019ve seen a president fighting to reclaim the security of the middle class and on the other side a group of people sort of paying lip service to the middle class, then actively working against them. That doesn\u2019t go unnoticed and the data is beginning to show that. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between putting middle class in your talking points and actually doing something about what they\u2019re going through.\u201d Republicans are quick to point out that the president is starting from historic lows for an incumbent. \u201cThese numbers are better than they were in November but it\u2019s nothing to be jumping up and down about. Instead of being really, really bad, it\u2019s just really bad for the president,\u201d said Republican pollster Ed Goeas. The CNN/ORC Poll also shows that the Republican brand has suffered. Only 43% of voters have a favorable view of the Republican Party, down 6 points since June, while the numbers for the Democratic Party have held steady at 55%. The view of the GOP has slipped since the debt-ceiling debacle and top Democratic operatives are convinced the Republican Party has taken more of the blame for the gridlock in Washington. They believe the GOP is likely to take a further hit if the payroll tax cuts aren\u2019t extended. However, it\u2019s unclear how the payroll tax cuts standoff will play in the end, because Obama\u2019s re-election hopes are tied to the overall health of the economy. If Congress fails to act, recession would be a \u201csignificant threat,\u201d said Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics. And few fates are worse for an incumbent president than running against a recession.",

            "article_content": "NEW: A \"devastating tax hike\" looms without House action, the White House says Boehner says he wants more negotiations on the payroll tax issue Pelosi says tea party Republicans in the House are stalling progress An Obama adviser says the House is unlikely to reject the Senate plan House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday that he opposed a temporary extension of a payroll tax cut, saying the two-month plan passed by the Senate \u201cis just kicking the can down the road.\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, urged Congress to continue negotiations Monday to come up with a compromise that would extend the current payroll tax rate for a full year, as the Obama administration wants. \u201cTwo months is just kicking the can down the road. The American people are tired of that,\u201d Boehner told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He said both the Senate and the House of Representatives should work out their differences and pass a one-year extension. But congressional Democratic leaders said the Republican-led House would be blamed for a year-end increase in working Americans\u2019 tax bills if it failed to go along with the Senate. The White House chimed in Sunday afternoon, noting that the current rates expire in less than two weeks. \u201cAs the president said yesterday, it is inexcusable to do anything less than extend this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on a one-year deal,\u201d White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said in a written statement. Pfeiffer pointed out that Boehner had called the two-month extension a \u201cgood deal\u201d only Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s time House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the American people,\u201d he said. The payroll tax break, which averages about $1,000 a year for an average family, runs out at the end of the year unless Congress votes to extend it. The battle extends beyond the usual Democratic-Republican wars to also include a face-off between the House and Senate over their respective plans that so far have been unable to win support in both chambers. CNNMoney: What happens if payroll tax cut is not extended? The Democratic-led Senate passed the two-month extension Saturday on an 89-10 vote, with support from most of the chamber\u2019s GOP minority. That was a fallback position after Democrats and Republicans were unable to reach a comprehensive agreement to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for a full year. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in a statement Sunday that Boehner had earlier left it to Senate leaders to come up with a deal, and now was changing his tune after the Senate easily adopted the two-month extension. \u201cNeither side got everything they wanted, but we forged a middle ground that passed the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIf Speaker Boehner refuses to vote on the bipartisan compromise that passed the Senate with 89 votes, Republicans will be forcing a thousand-dollar tax increase on middle class families on January 1st.\u201d In addition, a Senate Democratic aide told CNN the chances were \u201czero\u201d that the Senate would reconvene from its holiday recess to continue negotiating with the House on the issue. A statement Sunday from the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said the House will convene Monday to either amend the Senate bill or pass a motion to send the issue to a conference committee involving members of both chambers. An earlier House version of the payroll tax measure lacked support in the Senate and never came up for a vote there. Does House want to move forward? Two senators debate that question Gene Sperling, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council and Obama\u2019s assistant on economic policy, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Senate\u2019s strong bipartisan support for its two-month plan made House rejection unlikely. \u201cThe only things that get 90% support in the United States Senate these days are mom, apple pie, and chocolate ice cream, so I really think it is very unlikely that the House would disrupt this compromise,\u201d Sperling told CNN Political Correspondent Joe Johns. In addition, Sperling said the strong bipartisan support in the Senate made eventual approval of a one-year extension more likely. The Senate measure is the latest in a series of last-ditch temporary fixes, in this case seeking to postpone another legislative showdown until February, when the bill\u2019s provisions would expire. However, it requires approval by the House, and Boehner\u2019s comments indicated rejection by House Republicans, especially conservatives who don\u2019t like the payroll tax extension in any form. Under the current party breakdown in the House, at least 26 Republicans would have to join a unanimous Democratic minority to pass the Senate measure. Any slippage in Democratic support would require more Republican backing. Boehner apparently reversed himself since a conference call with caucus members Saturday, when he was the only House Republican leader to express support for the Senate plan, according to a GOP source. The source said Boehner described the Senate vote as \u201ca good deal\u201d and \u201ca victory\u201d in the conference call, and that Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole and North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones also expressed support. However, Cantor disagreed during the call, saying he thought the package should be extended for a full year, the Republican source said. \u201cThe rank-and-file members are extremely opposed to it,\u201d said the GOP source, adding that most members were concerned with the uncertainty caused by just a two-month extension, as well as the political benefit the White House could gain in the national dialogue over taxes. A House GOP aide said Sunday that Boehner outlined the next steps regarding the payroll tax measure during the conference call, but wasn\u2019t advocating for the Senate plan. \u201cThe speaker described three possible options \u2013 accept the Senate bill, go to conference, or amend the Senate bill and send it back,\u201d the aide said. On Sunday, Boehner was not asked about the caucus conference call in the NBC interview. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a statement Sunday that it was conservative House Republicans standing in the way of an agreement. \u201cBy holding up this bipartisan compromise, tea party House Republicans are walking away once again, showing their extremism and clearly demonstrating that they never intended to give the middle class a tax cut,\u201d Pelosi said. Reid and fellow Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said the issue involved Boehner\u2019s ability to lead his caucus. \u201cThis is a test of whether the House Republicans are fit to govern, and it is a make-or-break moment for John Boehner\u2019s speakership,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cYou cannot let a small group at the extreme resort to brinksmanship every time there is a major national issue and try to dictate every move this nation makes.\u201d According to Schumer, Boehner gave Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u201chis proxy to negotiate a bipartisan compromise.\u201d \u201cThis compromise was good enough for Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio. It was good enough for Jon Kyl and Tom Coburn. It should be good enough for Speaker Boehner,\u201d Schumer said, naming conservative Republican senators who supported the plan. \u201cThe speaker needs to put the Senate\u2019s bipartisan compromise on the floor and let House Democrats and the remaining sane members of the House Republican caucus vote for it.\u201d Obama and Democratic leaders have called for final approval of the Senate plan to decide the issue for now and set up further talks to reach a longer-term resolution after Congress returns from its holiday recess in January. On Saturday, Obama told reporters that he was pleased with the Senate\u2019s vote, but added that extending the cuts and assistance through next year should be considered just a \u201cformality.\u201d To do otherwise, he said, would be \u201cinexcusable.\u201d Reid said Friday that his party supported the proposed two-month deal because \u201cthat was the best we could get.\u201d The $33 billion deal, should it pass the House also extends unemployment benefits and avoids cutting federal funds to physicians who accept Medicare. In addition, it speeds up a decision over an oil pipeline, giving the White House 60 days to make a call on the controversial Keystone XL project. The pipeline, thought to be a necessary part of coaxing Republican support for the payroll tax break, is something Obama rejected when the idea of linking it to the payroll tax issue first emerged last week. The Obama administration delayed a final decision on the project until 2013 after complaints by environmentalists and Nebraska officials that the pipeline route could threaten that state\u2019s Sandhills region and vital Ogallala aquifer. Alternate routes are being considered, and Nebraska officials as well as the pipeline company, TransCanada, acknowledge that the process of approving a final route will last into the second half of 2012. The State Department has warned that a shortened deadline \u2013 as called for in both the Senate and House versions of the payroll tax plan \u2013 would leave insufficient time to assess the route alteration on a project that would transport oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands in northern Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. Obama made no mention of the proposed pipeline during Saturday\u2019s press conference. But in a briefing with reporters held after Obama\u2019s remarks, senior administration officials called the vote a win for working people and insisted the administration had given no ground on the pipeline issue. McConnell said he had no idea why the pipeline is considered controversial. \u201cThe labor unions like it. Many Democrats want it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt strengthens our national security by decreasing the amount of oil we get from unfriendly countries. And it wouldn\u2019t cost the taxpayers a dime.\u201d Republicans, who traditionally back the oil industry, have accused the White House of delaying the issue until after Obama\u2019s re-election bid. Labor unions that typically support Democrats back the pipeline project, while environmentalists who are also allied with the political left oppose it. Saturday\u2019s Senate measure is expected to reduce the deficit by nearly $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Under the plan, its $33 billion in costs would be offset by an increase in fees that new homeowners with federally backed mortgages will pay to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration. Those entities would then turn that money over to the U.S. Treasury. The bump amounts to about $15 per month for every $200,000 borrowed, Senate aides estimated.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama adviser says the chances are small that the House will reject the Senate plan House Speaker Boehner calls for more negotiations on the payroll tax issue The House will take up the Senate plan for a two-month extension on Monday Obama says not extending tax cuts and assistance through next year would be inexcusable House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday that he opposed the Senate plan to extend the payroll tax cut for two months, while a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama said chances were small that the House would reject the proposal. Boehner, R-Ohio, told the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Congress should continue negotiations to come up with a compromise by the end of the year that would extend the lower payroll tax rate for a full year, as sought by Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear and I and our members oppose the Senate bill,\u201d Boehner said, adding that a two-month extension was \u201cjust kicking the can down the road.\u201d The Senate plan passed Saturday was a fallback position after Democrats and Republicans were unable to reach a comprehensive agreement to extend the cuts and unemployment benefits for a full year. Gene Sperling, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council and Obama\u2019s assistant on economic policy, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Senate\u2019s strong bipartisan support in the 89-10 vote for its two-month plan made House rejection unlikely. \u201cWhat was significant about the vote yesterday (is) it had 89 votes \u2013 the compromise to extend the payroll tax cut, unemployment for 60 days into next year had 90% support,\u201d Sperling told CNN Political Correspondent Joe Johns. \u201cThe only things that get 90% support in the United States Senate these days are mom, apple pie, and chocolate ice cream, so I really think it is very unlikely that the House would disrupt this compromise.\u201d At the same time, Sperling assessed the chances for the issue to get resolved without further political drama in Congress before the end of the year as \u201cvery small.\u201d In the end, the possibility remained that a deal to extend the payroll tax cut for a full year could happen by January 1, when the current rate is set to go up. \u201cThis is Washington, D.C. \u2013 you don\u2019t categorically rule out anything,\u201d Sperling said. The measure is the latest in a series of last-ditch temporary fixes, postponing another legislative showdown between lawmakers until February, when the bill\u2019s provisions would expire under the Senate plan. However, it requires approval by the House, and Boehner\u2019s comments reinforced initial rejection of the plan by House Republicans, especially conservatives who don\u2019t like the payroll tax extension in any form. The House will take up the measure Monday. Boehner apparently reversed himself since a conference call with caucus members Saturday, when he was the only House Republican leader to express support for the Senate plan, according to a GOP source.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Friday that his party supported the proposed two-month deal because \u201cthat was the best we could get.\u201d The $33 billion deal, should it pass the House, also avoids cutting federal funds to physicians who accept Medicare and speeds up a decision over a pipeline, giving the White House 60 days to make a call on the controversial Keystone XL project.

            "article_content": "Obama wants Congress to approve short-term spending resolution Boehner, Reid, McConnell negotiate over impasse House Republicans may try to force vote on spending measure Democrats call for a short-term funding measure to buy time for broader negotiations In the first sign of progress in days of stalemate over the payroll tax extension and a government funding bill, House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell met privately for about an hour in the Capitol Wednesday night. There was no immediate sign that a deal was near, but the meeting could be an indication they finally are working directly with each other toward resolving the dispute that threatens to shutter the government at the end of the week and raise the payroll tax rate on working Americans at the end of the month. The development came amid news that Senate Democrats will offer a new proposal for extending the payroll tax cut that drops a provision to tax income over $1 million, a Democratic source told CNN. The so-called \u201cmillionaires tax\u201d was opposed by Republicans, who had blocked previous proposals by Senate Democrats to prevent the payroll tax on workers from returning to a higher rate at the end of the year. No further details were immediately available on the new proposal, first reported by CNN, which emerged from a White House meeting between Senate Democratic leaders and President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon, the source said. Conrad: War funds could pay for tax cut Congress bickers as tax hike looms Obama urges payroll tax cut extension Explain it to me: Payroll tax cuts 2011 a big year for flirting with government shutdowns Obama for months has argued that the wealthy should pay what he terms their fair share of taxes. A senior administration official told CNN the White House would not have any specific reaction to reports that Obama and Senate Democratic leaders were abandoning the surtax on millionaires as part of negotiations. But the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said, \u201cWe threw our support behind the Senate proposal on the millionaire surtax. It fell in line with the President\u2019s principles and priorities. So, we\u2019ve always been open to other pay-fors \u2013 but as the President has said himself a couple of times in the last 10 days \u2013 he won\u2019t accept a pay-for that\u2019s unbalanced and he won\u2019t allow extraneous political issues to get in the way.\u201d White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said Obama has concerns about provisions reported in the Republican-supported spending bill, which would keep the government operating after Friday. \u201cThis includes provisions that would undermine Wall Street reforms, enact extreme social and ideological riders, undercut environmental protections, and threaten the foreign policy prerogatives of the president. \u201cGiven the magnitude of the legislation \u2013 providing over $1 trillion dollars in funding \u2013 coupled with the unresolved payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance extension, Congress should pass a short-term continuing resolution as it has seven times already this year so that all parties have an appropriate opportunity to consider and complete all of the critical budget and economic issues \u2026\u201d Pfeiffer wrote. Earlier, political skullduggery spilled onto the Senate floor with Democratic and Republican leaders openly squabbling over the order of votes on the GOP payroll tax-cut plan and the spending measure needed to keep the government funded. The inability of Senate party leaders to agree on how to proceed, let alone actually schedule votes, stymied progress on measures that both parties have said they support in concept \u2013 holding down taxes for working Americans and determining government spending for the rest of the fiscal year. Washington\u2019s holiday gift: More gridlock In a rare display of overt hostility, Reid, D-Nevada, accused Republican counterpart McConnell of \u201cliving in a world of nonreality\u201d and said the GOP payroll tax cut plan passed Tuesday by the House was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate. McConnell, R-Kentucky, shot back that Democrats wasted weeks of time with political \u201cshow votes\u201d intended to bolster President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. The Senate, he said, should now vote first on a broad spending agreement reached by congressional negotiators to ensure that government funding continues after a previous short-term extension expires at midnight Friday. \u201cQuit wasting our time here in the Senate scoring points with the shutdown two days away,\u201d McConnell said. Reid and other Senate Democrats responded that McConnell and Republicans want to avoid certain defeat on their payroll tax plan, which includes controversial provisions to speed approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and weaken environmental regulations. House GOP leaders are considering a move that would try to force a vote on the huge government spending bill, according to two Republican members. In a closed-door House Republican conference meeting Wednesday, Boehner floated the option of not waiting for Democrats to sign off on a final agreement between the House and Senate on the measure. Instead, House GOP leaders are discussing combining the spending bills for various government agencies into a single package and having a House vote on Friday. They would then send it to the Senate and attempt to force Democrats to vote on it \u2013 or be held responsible for a potential government shutdown. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Florida, said leaders have not decided on that course, but are still determining whether they could get 218 Republican votes to pass it \u2013 assuming they are unlikely to get much Democratic support. Another Florida Republican, Allen West, said he supported the idea of the House moving ahead with its own spending bill package so federal agencies would be funded. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait,\u201d West told CNN. After the meeting, Boehner insisted that Republican and Democratic negotiators worked out a deal on the government funding bill, but that Senate Democrats are holding action on that measure hostage to negotiations on the payroll tax cut bill. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to all of us that President Obama and Senator Reid want to threaten a government shutdown so they can get leverage on a jobs bill because the United States Senate can\u2019t pass one,\u201d Boehner said. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent a letter Wednesday night to employees, citing possible effects of a shutdown. If funding lapses, she wrote, some employees would be furloughed. The letter was obtained by CNN. Balanced-budget proposals fail In a sign of the confusing politics at play, McConnell blocked Reid\u2019s attempt to bring the House payroll tax proposal to a vote. Reid sought to demonstrate that the Republican plan would fail, and Democrats accused McConnell and his GOP colleagues of trying to avoid the embarrassment of that outcome. The issue comes down to mistrust between the parties. Democrats fear that approving the spending deal first will allow Republicans to leave Washington for the upcoming holiday recess without compromising on the payroll tax-cut extension worth $1,000 to the average working family. Reid called instead for Congress to pass another short-term spending extension to keep the government funded until December 21, giving legislators more time to reach a deal on the payroll tax measure and the long-term spending proposal. McConnell said that isn\u2019t necessary, because negotiators on a House-Senate conference committee already reached agreement on the legislation. The problem, he said, is that Obama and Reid told Democratic negotiators not to sign the deal in order to hold up a final vote in a dispute over the separate payroll tax measure. The House passed its version of the payroll tax plan Tuesday on a 234-193 vote, largely along party lines. However, the White House has said Obama will veto the plan if it reaches his desk, setting up further brinksmanship with Congress scheduled to leave Washington for its holiday recess at the end of the week. The Keystone XL pipeline, which is currently in limbo as the State Department considers objections from environmentalists, would bring oil from Canada\u2019s oil sands in northern Alberta to Texas. Pipeline presents dilemma for Obama The State Department recently said its decision on the Keystone XL pipeline would be delayed until 2013 to allow examination of environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political, to put off the issue until after next year\u2019s presidential election. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said Tuesday that the payroll tax cut measure does exactly what Obama has been calling for by providing tax protection for working class Americans while creating new jobs through the pipeline project. Reid and other Democrats argue the pipeline project requires more study and should not be fast-tracked as part of a political calculation by Republicans.

            "article_content": "NEW: \"Congress needs to do its job and stop the tax hike,\" the White House says The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is unlikely to pass Republicans are linking the payroll tax to a controversial oil pipeline from Canada to Texas Democrats accuse Republicans of playing politics with a tax cut they traditionally support Another Washington political showdown took shape Tuesday as the House of Representatives passed a Republican plan that would extend the payroll tax cut and speed the process for government approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The bill, approved on a 234-193 vote largely on party lines, now goes to the Senate, where it was unlikely to pass due to strong opposition from Democratic leaders. And the White House says President Barack Obama will veto the plan if it reaches his desk, setting up further brinksmanship with Congress scheduled to leave Washington for its holiday recess at the end of the week. \u201cThis Congress needs to do its job and stop the tax hike that\u2019s scheduled to affect 160 million Americans in 18 days,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThis is not a time for Washington Republicans to score political points against the president.\u201d The impasse involves a convergence of major issues, including the payroll tax-cut extension and a spending bill that must pass in order to keep the government funded after Friday. Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, agreed that Congress must not go home for the holidays without extending the payroll tax cut that saves working Americans an average of $1,000 a year, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. White House: Confident about payroll tax Hutchison: Payroll tax cut will continue Explain it to me: Payroll tax cuts Obama urges payroll tax cut extension Without spelling out a specific order of necessary steps, Carney made clear that Obama wants Congress to approve both a payroll tax plan and the broad government spending bill. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky characterized the Democratic stance as a threat to delay action on the spending plan until a compromise is reached on the payroll tax cut measure. That could cause a government shutdown after Friday, McConnell warned. Carney, however, insisted that Congress has plenty of time to act on all of the outstanding measures, and called for a payroll tax extension free of the pipeline provision. Earlier, Speaker John Boehner and other House Republican leaders told reporters that the payroll tax measure to be voted on later in the day had bipartisan support and would create jobs while also preventing a tax increase for American workers next year. When the vote came, 10 Democrats joined 224 Republicans voting for the bill, while 14 Republicans joined 179 Democrats voting against it. Asked about opposition by Senate Democrats who say they will reject the House measure, Boehner said: \u201cThe Senate will have to do whatever they have to do.\u201d The pipeline, which is currently in limbo as the State Department considers objections from environmentalists, would bring oil from Canada\u2019s oil sands in northern Alberta to Texas. More on the pipeline showdown The State Department recently said its decision on the Keystone XL pipeline would be delayed until 2013 to allow examination of environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political, to put off the issue until after next year\u2019s presidential election. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said the payroll tax cut measure does exactly what Obama has been calling for by providing tax protection for working class Americans while creating new jobs through the pipeline project. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, offered a colorful take on what will happen if  Reid blocks the House plan, as threatened. \u201cIf Sen. Reid wants to hold up the jobs bill, he will go on Santa\u2019s naughty list,\u201d Hensarling said. Reid and other Democrats argue the pipeline project requires more study and should not be fast-tracked as part of a political calculation by Republicans. On Tuesday, Reid said Republicans must compromise with Democrats instead of trying to push through proposals intended to appease conservatives in their caucus. \u201cSpeaker Boehner had to add ideological candy coating to his bill to get rebellious, rank-and-file Republicans on board,\u201d Reid said, adding: \u201cThey are wasting time catering to the tea party when they should be working with Democrats on a bipartisan package that can pass both houses.\u201d The House GOP proposal would both change the process and shorten the time frame for the government to approve the proposed pipeline from Canada to Texas. But Monday, the State Department said that would make it impossible for it to complete needed environmental, national security and safety studies. \u201cIn the absence of properly completing the process, the department would be unable to make a determination to issue a permit for this project,\u201d the State Department said in a written response to questions about the measure. Boehner dismissed the State Department\u2019s warning later Monday, saying the pipeline had been under review for three years and, \u201cAll the work has been done.\u201d \u201cThe only thing arbitrary about this decision is the decision by the president to say, \u2018Well, let\u2019s wait until after the next election,\u2019\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThe American people want jobs, and this is as close to a shovel-ready project as you\u2019re ever going to see.\u201d The House GOP measure extends the payroll tax cut for one year and renews aid for the unemployed, while cutting back the maximum length of jobless benefits from the current 99 weeks to 59. The bill also allows states more flexibility in distributing unemployment assistance, permitting states to require those applying to submit to drug tests or show they are pursuing a high school degree, if they don\u2019t have one. The bill would also avoid a scheduled cut in pay for Medicare physicians for two years, a provision known as the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d To pay for the bill, GOP leaders use a series of spending cuts, including freezing pay for federal employees and members of Congress, eliminating a child tax credit for those in the United States illegally, and increasing Medicare premiums for those who earn more than $80,000 annually. The pipeline issue is just one part of the problem for Senate Democrats who disagree with \u201ccentral elements\u201d of the GOP bill, including the length of the unemployment insurance extension, the proposed cost offsets and the weakening of some environmental regulations. Carney said Tuesday the spending cuts go deeper than levels agreed to in August in the deal negotiated by Congress and the White House to raise the federal debt ceiling. Democrats led by Obama have been pushing for the payroll tax cut extension; Republicans initially opposed the plan but have now signed on. However, the parties are at loggerheads over how to pay for it as well as the political optics over who should get credit, as an election year approaches. As a way to garner support from reluctant conservative Republicans, who voiced concerns about the impact of the payroll tax cut on Social Security, GOP leaders insisted on keeping the provision aimed at moving toward approving the pipeline project within 60 days. Senate Democrats have begun working on a new bill of their own after Republicans blocked progress on their previous proposals that included a surtax on income over $1 million. Meanwhile, in the other big bill Congress needs to get done before funding expires, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers told reporters off the House floor Monday that negotiators have worked out a deal on the year-end spending bill that wraps nine remaining bills into one package. The Kentucky Republican said there are some \u201cpolicy riders\u201d in the deal, but he declined to get into any specifics on which ones, saying he wants the staff to finish writing the legislation before he talks about any details. But Rogers said it is taking some time to \u201ccross the T\u2019s\u201d so the bill would not be posted online Monday night, which puts off the House vote to Thursday at the earliest. Rogers was confident the House would pass the bill, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll get it done by\u201d Friday. According to two senior House Republican leadership aides, Reid has told Boehner he would hold up the spending bill until both sides negotiate a compromise on the payroll tax cut bill. Asked about a potential government shutdown, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Congress may need to pass a short-term spending measure to prevent a shutdown if the parties fail to reach agreement on the various unresolved issues, including the extension of both the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. Carney also said Tuesday that a continuing resolution on spending is a possible short-term solution to provide more time to work out a deal on the payroll tax measure.

            "article_content": "NEW: \"All the work has been done\" on the pipeline plan, Boehner says The State Department says it couldn't approve the pipeline under the GOP plan Workers face higher taxes, if the lower payroll tax rate isn't extended by the end of the year Republicans say a payroll tax cut deal will happen but differ on details Republicans demanding specific ideological provisions as part of a deal to extend the payroll tax cut appear to be going against their party\u2019s anti-tax orthodoxy, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. Asked by reporters about a Republican plan to maintain the reduced payroll tax rate for another year, Carney questioned why the party that traditionally supports tax cuts is driving such a hard bargain on one that helps American workers and their families. \u201cWhat happened to Republican support for tax cuts?\u201d Carney asked, noting what he called the \u201cpassionate\u201d GOP opposition this year to Democratic efforts to end Bush-era tax cuts for wealthy Americans. When it comes to easing the tax burden for working-class taxpayers, Carney said, the Republicans are demanding ideological provisions in the payroll tax cut legislation that they know Democrats oppose. The plan by House Republicans, expected to come up for a vote as soon as Tuesday,  links the payroll tax rate issue to a provision to speed up government approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands production in northern Alberta to Texas. The State Department recently said its decision on the Keystone XL pipeline would be delayed until 2013 to examine environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political to put off the issue until after next year\u2019s presidential election. President Barack Obama said last week that he will reject any effort to link the oil pipeline to extending the payroll tax cut, which will maintain $1,000 in tax savings for American workers. Hutchison: Payroll tax cut will continue The House GOP proposal would both change the process and shorten the time frame for the government to approve the proposed pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands production in northern Alberta to Texas. But Monday, the State Department said that would make it impossible for it to complete needed environmental, national security and safety studies. \u201cIn the absence of properly completing the process, the Department would be unable to make a determination to issue a permit for this project,\u201d the State Department said in a written response to questions about the measure. But House Speaker John Boehner dismissed the State Department\u2019s warning, saying the pipeline had been under review for three years and, \u201cAll the work has been done.\u201d \u201cThe only thing arbitrary about this decision is the decision by the president to say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s wait until after the next election,\u2019 \u201d said Boehner, R-Ohio. \u201cThe American people want jobs, and this is as close to a shovel-ready project as you\u2019re ever going to see.\u201d The House GOP measure extends the payroll tax cut for one year and renews aid for the unemployed, while cutting back the maximum length of jobless benefits from the current 99 weeks to 59. The bill also allows states more flexibility in distributing unemployment assistance, permitting states to require those applying to submit to drug tests or show they are pursuing a high school degree, if they don\u2019t have one. The bill would also avoid a scheduled cut in pay for Medicare physicians for two years, a provision known as the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d Explain it to me: Payroll tax cuts To pay for the bill, GOP leaders use a series of spending cuts, including freezing pay for federal employees and members of Congress, eliminating a child tax credit for those in the U.S. illegally, and increasing Medicare premiums for those who earn more than $80,000 annually. The pipeline issue is just one part of the problem for Senate Democrats who disagree with \u201ccentral elements\u201d of the GOP bill, including the length of the unemployment insurance extension and the proposed cost offsets. Carney said Monday the spending cuts go deeper than levels agreed to in August in the deal negotiated by Congress and the White House to raise the federal debt ceiling. He called the House GOP proposal on the payroll tax cut a \u201cperfect example of the kind of chicanery you get in Washington, where your word is no longer your word a few months later for political expedience.\u201d Sunday, two leading conservative Senate Republicans predicted Congress will agree to extend the payroll tax cut before it expires at the end of the year. The comments demonstrated the GOP shift on a proposal originally opposed by Republican leaders, even as each side continues trying to persuade the other of the best legislative approach to take. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d the House Republican plan could get bipartisan support in both chambers. But South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he doubted a final bill would include the Keystone provision. More on the pipeline showdown \u201cAt the end of the day the payroll tax will get extended as it is now,\u201d Graham said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding: \u201cThe pipeline\u2019s probably not going to sell.\u201d Democrats led by Obama have been pushing for the payroll tax cut extension, with Republicans initially opposing the plan but now signing on. However, the parties are at loggerheads over how to pay for it as well as the political optics over who should get credit, as an election year approaches. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest priority of the president and the Democrats in Congress,\u201d liberal Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told NBC. The impasse sets up another countdown clock on congressional action, this time before the end-of-year holiday recess scheduled to begin at the end of next week. As a way to garner support from reluctant conservative Republicans, who voiced concerns about the impact of the payroll tax cut on Social Security, GOP leaders insisted on keeping the provision aimed at moving toward approving the pipeline project within 60 days. The House is expected to vote on the Republican bill Tuesday. In the meantime, Senate Democrats have begun working on a new bill of their own after Republicans blocked progress on previous proposals that included a surtax on income over $1 million. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to pay for it in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d Graham said on NBC, adding that the \u201cidea of taxing one group to pay for a tax cut for another is not going to sell.\u201d Durbin complained that Republicans \u201chave consistently said they will refuse to increase the taxes on the wealthiest people in America one penny, if that\u2019s what it takes to make sure that working families get a payroll tax cut.\u201d Meanwhile, in the other big bill Congress needs to get done before funding expires, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers told reporters off the House floor Monday that negotiators have worked out a deal on the year-end spending bill that wraps the nine remaining bills into one package. The Kentucky Republican said there are some \u201cpolicy riders\u201d in the deal, but he declined to get into any specifics on which ones, saying he wanted the staff to finish writing the legislation before he talked about any details. But Rogers said it is taking some time to \u201ccross the Ts\u201d so the bill would not be posted online Monday night, which puts off the House vote to Thursday at the earliest. The government runs out of money on Friday, December 16. Rogers was confident the House would pass the bill, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll get it done by the 16th.\u201d House GOP leaders have pledged that bills need to be posted for three days before they can get a vote on the floor. Rogers said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office still needs to score the spending bill that some are calling the \u201cmegabus.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

Reid: \"They are just wasting valuable time because it will not pass the Senate\" Rep. Boehner: The pipeline \"would create tens of thousands of jobs immediately.\" Senate Democrats have begun working on a new bill of their own Ensuring a pre-holiday collision course with the Senate, House Republicans Friday ignored criticism from President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats and formally unveiled a bill that extends the payroll tax cut and benefits for jobless Americans, but ties those items to a provision that clears a path toward approving the Keystone XL pipeline. Senate Democrats bristled at the inclusion of the controversial pipeline \u2013 which would eventually run from Canada though the Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid promised it would not pass in the Senate. \u201cNow is not the time to be debating unrelated measures like an oil pipeline,\u201d Reid said in a statement Friday.  \u201cIf the House sends us their bill with Keystone in it, they are just wasting valuable time because it will not pass the Senate.\u201d The House GOP measure extends the payroll tax cut for one year and renews aid for the unemployed, while cutting back the maximum length of jobless benefits from the current 99 weeks to 59.

To pay for the bill, GOP leaders use a series of spending cuts, including freezing pay for federal employees and members of Congress, eliminating a child tax credit for those in the U.S. illegally, and increasing Medicare premiums for those who earn more than $80,000 annually. Pelosi: GOP extremists stalling tax cut \u201cThis package does not include everything Republicans would like, nor does it have all that Democrats have called for; but it is a win for the American people and worthy of the president\u2019s signature,\u201d Boehner said in a written statement.

Earlier this week, Obama warned that he would reject any bill that coupled approval of the Keystone XL project to a bill renewing tax cuts.  And White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated the president\u2019s opposition to the package on Friday, saying \u201cRepublican leaders in Congress are still playing politics at the expense of middle class families.\u201d Carney said the GOP plan violates previous budget agreements and \u201cgives a free pass to the wealthiest and corporations\u201d while \u201cchoosing to refight old political battles.\u201d House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi argued Friday the GOP bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a shot\u201d and said the pipeline provision is \u201ca poison pill designed to sink the payroll tax cut.\u201d The House is expected to vote on the bill Tuesday.

Democratic leaders and staff will work over the weekend writing the new offer and could put it up for a vote by the middle of next week. The aide said the bill will be \u201cdesigned to attract bipartisan support,\u201d although the aide could not say if Democrats would jettison the surtax on incomes over $1 million as part of this new bill.  Senate Republicans to this point have stood nearly uniformly against the surtax as a way to help pay for the payroll tax extension.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Republicans propose spending, benefit cuts to pay for payroll tax cut extension A Democratic proposal would tax millionaires to pay for expanding the payroll tax cut Republicans oppose such a surtax and offer an alternative plan Failure to extend the payroll tax cut will cost average families about $1,000 a year President Barack Obama on Wednesday challenged Republicans to \u201cfight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are more fortunate,\u201d telling a Pennsylvania crowd to push Congress to extend the payroll tax cut enacted a year ago. Obama met with a family in Scranton, the birthplace of Vice President Joe Biden, then spoke at a nearby high school in what will be a battleground state in next year\u2019s presidential election. Sounding the populist themes of his re-election bid so far, Obama complained that congressional Republicans were out of touch with mainstream American support for his jobs bill that included an extension of the payroll tax cut. He noted Senate Republicans previously blocked debate on the plan, saying that \u201ctheir actions lately don\u2019t reflect who we are as a people.\u201d A loud cheer erupted when Obama described the Democratic proposal to extend and expand the reduced payroll tax rate by saying: \u201cIt is paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share.\u201d Obama: Campaigner in chief? Obama and blue collar voters Can Obama win over blue collar workers? Noting the hard-line Republican opposition in deficit reduction negotiations to any tax increases for the wealthy, Obama urged the audience to ask its elected representatives \u201care you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are more fortunate?\u201d \u201cSend your senators a message,\u201d Obama said to cheers. \u201cTell them don\u2019t be a grinch.  Don\u2019t be a grinch.  Don\u2019t vote to raise taxes on working American during the holidays.\u201d Economists say the payroll tax cut \u2013 part of a congressional spending deal negotiated last December \u2013 has contributed to the nation\u2019s economic recovery. Congressional Republicans have indicated support for extending the lower payroll tax rate for another year, but differ with Obama and Democrats on covering the more than $200 billion price tag. A Democratic bill under consideration by the Senate would assess a 3.25% tax on income above $1 million a year to cover the cost. Republicans reject any tax increases and offered their alternative later Wednesday, calling for a freeze of federal salaries, reducing the federal workforce and preventing millionaires from getting food stamps and unemployment benefits. \u201cRepublicans will put aside their misgivings and support this extension, not because we believe as the President does that another short-term stimulus will turn this economy around \u2026 but because we know it will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue to need it nearly three years into this presidency,\u201d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Wednesday on the Senate floor. The Democratic surtax would hit wealthy Americans who create jobs, McConnell added, arguing such a strategy made no sense. The debate, he said, is about \u201cwhether we should help those who are struggling in a bad economy by punishing the private sector businesses that the American people are counting on to help turn this economy around.\u201d The White House pushed back against the Republican argument. Spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama to Pennsylvania that the White House was open to Republican ideas on the legislation. At the same time, Earnest noted that Republicans have defended Bush-era tax cuts for millionaires but now raised questions about helping ease the tax burden of working-class Americans. On Tuesday, the new chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Alan Krueger, told reporters that the proposed surtax on incomes above $1 million \u201cwould hit very few small businesses.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority \u2013 one figure I saw was 99% of individuals with small business income \u2013 would not be affected by this,\u201d Krueger said. According to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 121 million families have benefited from the payroll tax break, with an increase in take-home pay of $934 for the average worker. Moody\u2019s Analytics estimated in August that letting the tax cut expire would reduce growth by as much as 0.5%. It called extending the cut one of the \u201cmost straightforward\u201d ways to \u201creduce some of the coming fiscal restraint.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 bill would extend and expand last year\u2019s tax break. Payroll taxes, cut to 4.2% from 6.2% last year, would be lowered to 3.1% to provide middle class families with up to $1,500 more in their paychecks next year, Democrats said. Their measure also would partially extend the break to employers, hoping that might spur hiring. The price tag of the bill is about $265 billion, paid for by the 3.25% surtax on annual income above $1 million, according to Democratic aides. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada noted Tuesday that polls show a majority of Republican voters think wealthy Americans should pay more in taxes. \u201cThe only place in America that people don\u2019t want a fair system is Republicans here in the Senate,\u201d Reid said. By contrast, the Republican plan would continue the 4.2% payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three-year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal workforce by 10% through replacing workers when they quit or retire. In addition, the plan would require Americans earning $750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for Medicare, and also prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation. According to a Republican aide, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that the Medicare, food stamp and unemployment provisions would save $9 billion over 10 years, mostly from the Medicare part. A statement by Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said the Republican plan would never pass i the Democrat-controlled Senate, \u201cbut now that Republicans have reversed their position on the middle-class tax cut, we look forward to working with them to negotiate a consensus solution.\u201d Obama\u2019s trip Wednesday was his 17th to Pennsylvania since taking office. Obama won the state by a 10-point margin in 2008, but Pennsylvania is seen as largely in play in the 2012 contest. A Franklin and Marshall College poll taken in early November indicated Obama ahead of potential Republican rivals in Pennsylvania in hypothetical 2012 general election showdowns. However, many voters surveyed said they hadn\u2019t yet made up their mind about whom to support in the presidential election.

            "article_content": "NEW: Few legal challenges are made against executive orders The White House says if Congress, and especially Republicans, won't act, we will Republicans reject the White House campaign as grandstanding Presidents always try to expand the power of the executive branch, an expert says President Barack Obama is crafting his own laws of political physics these days, insisting that inaction by a divided Congress requires White House action in order to get something done. A campaign labeled \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait\u201d pushes unilateral directives and programs from the White House as the only way to push ahead on the president\u2019s agenda when a do-nothing Congress fails to act. \u201cThere is inaction. There is a lack of action,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney explained to reporters this week when asked about a series of executive orders and actions the president has taken or is planning. \u201cSo there is a need to move, because we can move.\u201d Republicans reject the premise of the White House position, arguing that Obama chooses to blame Congress for inaction instead of working with legislators from both parties on bills that can pass. White House reaches out to local media House Speaker John Boehner, speaking on the Laura Ingraham show last week, described as laughable the prospect that Obama would use executive orders to bypass Congress on substantive issues. At the same time, though, the Ohio Republican said he would keep close watch to make sure nothing unconstitutional happens. To Adam Warber, a Clemson University political science professor who wrote a book on executive orders, Obama is carrying on a consistent tradition of his predecessors in trying to expand the power of the presidency as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s incremental,\u201d Warber said. \u201cEach president kind of adds to the power that the presidency has.\u201d In Obama\u2019s case, \u201cwe pretty much are seeing that behind the scenes he\u2019s centralizing power,\u201d Warber continued. \u201cHe\u2019s not really different than anyone else.\u201d For Obama, the strategy of executive orders serves a dual purpose by moving forward on parts of his agenda despite Republican opposition while projecting an image of decisive action in the face of political inaction. \u201cCongress has been trying since February to do something about this,\u201d Obama said Monday in announcing an executive order that directs the Food and Drug Administration to increase efforts to reduce shortages of some prescription drugs. \u201cIt has not yet been able to get it done.  And it is the belief of this administration \u2026 that we can\u2019t wait for action on the Hill; we\u2019ve got to go ahead and move forward.\u201d His GOP foes call such rhetoric grandstanding, noting it leads to piecemeal steps instead of working with Congress to pass more substantive legislation acceptable to both parties. \u201cI know he\u2019s desperately interested in trying to blame anybody else, but he\u2019s the president of the United States, he set the agenda, he got everything he wanted. And it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said last week. Obama rejects the Republican view, saying in his weekly address Saturday that GOP foes now refuse to debate job-creation measures that congressional Republicans have supported in the past. In addition, Republican counter-proposals to cut regulations and roll back health care and Wall Street reforms failed to address the immediate need to reduce unemployment, Obama argues. \u201cMeanwhile, they\u2019re only scheduled to work three more weeks between now and the end of the year,\u201d Obama said in the Saturday address. \u201cThe truth is, we can no longer wait for Congress to do its job.  The middle-class families who\u2019ve been struggling for years are tired of waiting.  They need help now.  So where Congress won\u2019t act, I will.\u201d Warber, however, said the presidential messaging of the \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait\u201d campaign amounts to what he called \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d Obama  is trying to \u201cpass the ball\u201d to congressional Republicans \u201cso that they have to hold economic problems in their hands during the election,\u201d said Warber, whose 2006 book was titled \u201cExecutive Orders and the Modern Presidency: Legislating from the Oval Office.\u201d Almost three years into his term, Obama is on a similar pace in issuing executive orders issued as his recent predecessors such as George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. While some executive orders are routine or ceremonial in nature, presidents since Jimmy Carter have used them more for major policy directives to sidestep the legislative or bureaucratic process, Warber said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing here is they\u2019re using these tools to bypass the legislative process to make laws,\u201d he said, adding that the White House \u201cthrough the president is taking the lead, saying this is what we want here.\u201d The prescription drug executive order announced Monday is designed to help reduce a growing number of prescription drug shortages while protecting patients from possible pharmaceutical industry price gouging. Among other things, the order requires the Food and Drug Administration to increase its reporting of possible shortages of certain prescription drugs, while also speeding up regulatory reviews of new drug manufacturing sites, drug suppliers and manufacturing changes. The Justice Department will be tasked with examining whether specific drug shortages are tied to an intentional stockpiling of medications designed to raise prices. Other new policies pushed by the White House include steps to help families refinance homes that have lost value in the recession, programs to help war veterans get jobs, and reforms to student loan processing. When questioned by reporters Tuesday, Carney conceded that legislation passed by Congress would be a more substantive step toward the kind of job-creation measures needed to help the struggling economic recovery. For example, Obama\u2019s proposed jobs bill \u201cis filled with provisions that require legislative action,\u201d Carney said. \u201cHe\u2019s not pulling things out and making them law by fiat. I\u2019m sure he wishes he could.\u201d Carney also has insisted that Obama \u201cis acting well within his authority, well within his constitutional authority\u201d by taking what he called administrative steps. According to Warber, other examples of unilateral executive steps include signing statements, proclamations, memorandums and directives. Signing statements are documents from the president that challenge or reject specific provisions in bills passed by Congress, acting as a kind of line-item veto that can serve as legal reasoning in a possible court challenge, Warber said. Proclamations are usually ceremonial in nature, he added, but presidents have been known to slip in policy statements or other substantive steps. If the language shifts from the generally flowery prose of a ceremonial proclamation, he said, look closely for a policy issue somewhere in the text. Historically, executive orders are rarely overturned. To do so in Congress would require overcoming a likely presidential veto, an unlikely event in the current Democratic-controlled Senate. Warber noted that the Supreme Court could exercise its judicial review authority to strike down an executive order as being unconstitutional. However, he said, research showed that Congress and the courts \u201chave been quite passive in challenging executive orders.\u201d \u201cThere is a lot of research that is needed on this subject,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one of the theories about why this might be the case is that Congress and the courts are reluctant to engage in a separation-of-powers battle with the president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama blasts Republican opposition to his $447 billion jobs bill GOP leaders accuse the president of dividing the country for short-term political gain Obama visits North Carolina and Virginia -- key battlegrounds in the presidential race The White House wants Congress to pass Obama's jobs bill incrementally President Barack Obama continued hammering Republicans over their opposition to his $447 billion jobs plan Tuesday, casting the GOP as handmaidens of the rich unwilling to support fair sacrifices in order to help a struggling middle class. After visiting a computer lab and robotics workshop at a southern Virginia high school, Obama told a jammed auditorium at another school in Emporia that Republican opposition to his job plan makes no sense. Republicans want to roll back environmental and financial regulations instead of taking concrete steps to create jobs, Obama said. \u201cThat is a plan, but it\u2019s not a jobs plan,\u201d he said of a GOP counter-proposal to his jobs plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan to go back to doing the exact thing that we were doing before the financial crisis that put so many people out of work.\u201d He called on the crowd to \u201cgive Congress a piece of your mind,\u201d prompting applause as he said: \u201cTell these members of Congress that they\u2019re supposed to be working for you, not special interests. \u2026They need to deliver because they\u2019re not delivering right now.\u201d The Virginia stops followed a morning visit to a school and community center in Jamestown, North Carolina, where Obama said \u201cfolks in Washington don\u2019t seem to be listening\u201d to calls for help. \u201cI want to work with Republicans,\u201d the president insisted. But political leaders need to \u201cfocus less on trying to satisfy one wing of one party,\u201d he said \u2013 an apparent reference to populist tea party conservatives. America needs \u201can economy that works for everybody, not just for folks at the top,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow is the time to act.  Now is the time to say \u2018yes we can.\u2019 \u201c Obama\u2019s remarks came on day two of a three-day campaign-style swing through the two pivotal battleground states that he won in 2008 but are considered toss-ups in next year\u2019s presidential race. The president has toured schools, stopped to shake hands and eaten lunch at local restaurants on the trip. An unplanned stop to greet well-wishers on the side of the road delayed Tuesday\u2019s speech in Emporia by more than half an hour. While crowds have chanted his name and cheered his presence, one woman in a Virginia tobacco country waved a large Confederate flag as Obama\u2019s motorcade passed by. Democrats are promising to force votes on individual components of the Obama plan, starting with $35 billion for states and localities to hire more teachers and first responders while preventing current ones from being laid off. That part of the plan could come up for a vote before the end of this week. \u201cIf (the Republicans) vote against the proposals I\u2019m talking about \u2026 they don\u2019t have to answer to me,\u201d Obama told the North Carolina crowd.  \u201cThey have to answer to you.\u201d For their part, GOP leaders accused the president of trying to divide the country for his own short-term political gain while repeating what they\u2019ve characterized as a failed 2009 economic stimulus plan. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the vast majority of Americans aren\u2019t happy with Washington right now,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.  \u201cIt\u2019s also no secret that the president of the United States is trying to use this displeasure with Washington for political gain.  And I think that\u2019s a pretty sad commentary on the state of affairs over at the White House these days.\u201d McConnell added: \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly obvious why the president would find the path of division appealing, because on the number one issue we face \u2013 jobs and the economy \u2013 the president\u2019s policies haven\u2019t worked as advertised.\u201d Veteran Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 election, criticized the president Monday for using the taxpayer-funded trip for what McCain called political campaigning. \u201cOn the taxpayer-paid dime, the president is now traveling, attacking the Republican plan,\u201d McCain said on the Senate floor. While noting Obama\u2019s right to level such criticism in a political venue, McCain added: \u201cIs that appropriate on the taxpayer\u2019s dime, since it is clearly campaigning?\u201d Republicans have accused the president of engaging in \u201cclass warfare,\u201d while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility. Republicans have accused the president of engaging in so-called \u201cclass warfare,\u201d while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility. On Monday, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that Democrats will seek a 0.5% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million to pay for the component of Obama\u2019s jobs bill dealing with teachers and first responders. However, a top Senate Republican leadership aide immediately responded that Republicans \u2013 and some Democrats \u2013 probably would not be willing to go along with a tax increase to pay for the measure. Among other things, Obama\u2019s overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. The largest measure in the package is the payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion. Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December.  Obama wants to cut the tax in half, to 3.1%. A second key measure \u2013 estimated to cost roughly $44 billion \u2013 is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed. Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times.

            "article_content": "This week, GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain gained in the polls Cain is touting his \"9-9-9-\" tax plan; critics have attacked the plan at debates There is still plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to change As the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination has come into sharper focus, an unlikely figure has emerged \u2013 former Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO Herman Cain. A CNN poll of polls indicates that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is on top of the GOP field of candidates at 23%, and Cain is just three points behind. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who was a front-runner in the national polls from late August through much of September, trails Cain at 14%. The CNN poll of polls is an average of the latest four national surveys in the GOP race. It was compiled and released Thursday, Polling in critical early voting states indicates that Cain is statistically tied with Romney in Iowa and South Carolina and that Cain has surged to second place behind Romney in New Hampshire. Appearing on \u201cErin Burnett Outfront,\u201d Cain explained his rise to CNN. \u201cI believe that this happened for two reasons\u2026 . First, it demonstrates that the voice of the people is more important than the voice of the media, with all due respect,\u201d he said Thursday, adding, \u201cThe second key message is message is more powerful than money.  I have not spent, nor have I been able to raise, the kind of money that my major competitors have.  But yet we have been competitive because of the strength of my message, and the specificity of the solution that I put on the table.\u201d The solution Cain is referring to is his \u201c9-9-9\u201d tax plan, whose catchy name has become his virtual political trademark. The plan calls for doing away with almost all of the existing tax code and replacing it with a 9% flat federal individual income tax, a 9% flat federal corporate tax, and a new 9% national sales tax that Cain would institute. Cain has insisted that \u201c9-9-9\u201d will raise as much revenue for the federal government as the current tax code and that his plan will not cause lower-income taxpayers to pay more than they do under the current system.  But economists have raised serious questions about his plan, and Cain\u2019s campaign has provided scant details about it. Notwithstanding these questions, \u201c9-9-9\u201d has gained political traction and become a target of Cain\u2019s Republican rivals and even of the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s standing on its head what Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican, had in mind when he proposed a national income tax that\u2019d be progressive,\u201d Vice President Joe Biden said of Cain\u2019s plan Wednesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d Cain's political star on the rise And \u201c9-9-9\u201d dominated discussion at Tuesday\u2019s Bloomberg TV/Washington Post/WBIN-TV GOP presidential debate. \u201cThe 9-9-9 plan that I have proposed is simple, transparent, efficient, fair, and neutral,\u201d Cain declared during the debate. But many of his rivals used the debate to attack \u201c9-9-9.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a catchy phrase. In fact, I thought it was the price of a pizza when I first heard it,\u201d former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman joked during the debate. \u201cWe need something that\u2019s doable, doable, doable.\u201d Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum suggested that the public would not support a new national sales tax and touched on an increasing conservative criticism of \u201c9-9-9\u201d \u2013 that it gives the federal government a new revenue stream without any guarantee that the individual or corporate tax rates will stay at 9% as Cain envisions. In response to direct questioning from Cain about his own more complicated economic plan, Romney suggested that \u201c9-9-9\u201d was too simple.  \u201cHerman,\u201d Romney said to Cain, \u201cI have had the experience in my life of taking on some tough problems.  And I must admit that simple answers are always very helpful, but oftentimes inadequate.\u201d And Rep. Michele Bachmann\u2019s attack quite literally turned \u201c9-9-9\u201d on its head.  In a reference to 666, a symbol commonly associated with Satan, Bachmann quipped during the debate: \u201cAnd one thing I would say is, when you take the \u20189-9-9\u2019 plan and you turn it upside down, I think the devil is in the details.\u201d A leading fiscal conservative group, however, came out in favor of the plan Friday. While \u201c9-9-9\u201d has put Cain at the center of the GOP\u2019s debate over the economy, it is perhaps too simple an explanation for Cain\u2019s recent rise. \u201cHerman Cain is surprising us all,\u201d Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, told CNN recently. Kremer quickly added that her organization is not ready to support a candidate yet and the tea party movement \u201chasn\u2019t really coalesced behind anybody.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d continued Kremer, \u201cHerman Cain is doing a major thing right now. He\u2019s got a lot of momentum. A lot of people like him. He\u2019s a straight talker. He\u2019s a businessman. And that\u2019s what people like. He knows how to run a business. He knows how to create jobs. He knows about profits.\u201d Cain\u2019s biography has an inherent appeal \u2013 especially in these tough economic and fiscal times when faith in government and political leaders is at a low. Cain, who is African-American, is not a career politician \u2013 a fact he frequently touts. Instead, he has a business background. He comes from modest working-class roots in Atlanta, and he attended college and graduate school in computer science before eventually making his way onto the executive track. Cain is also a survivor of Stage 4 cancer, an experience that has led him to be an outspoken critic of President Obama\u2019s health care reform. At a GOP debate in Florida in late September, Cain attributed his survival to the fact that he was able to get the necessary treatment in less than a year\u2019s time. \u201cI\u2019m here five years cancer-free, because I could do it on my timetable and not a bureaucrat\u2019s timetable,\u201d Cain said when asked about an earlier statement that he would have died if the Democratic plan had been in place in 2006 when he was diagnosed. Recently, Cain hosted his own radio talk show in the Atlanta area, potentially giving him a built-in base of supporters in Atlanta\u2019s conservative suburbs. And as his presidential campaign has taken flight, he\u2019s promoted his book, \u201cThis Is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House,\u201d which was released earlier this month. Cain\u2019s biography and tax policy may be playing a role in his recent poll, according to one GOP strategist. \u201cGov. Romney has solidified his position in the race as one of the front-runners,\u201d said Dan Ronayne, who previously worked for the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and President George W. Bush\u2019s re-election campaign and is not backing any 2012 candidate. \u201cAnd there appears to be a contest to identify who would be a conservative alternative. Cain has performed very well in the debates, and he seems to be solidifying himself in that contest.\u201d Ronayne also observed that \u201cthere is an appetite for someone who is an outsider and someone who can talk about being a job creator.\u201d And the volatile dynamics of the GOP race may have also fueled Cain\u2019s surge. Romney emerged early as the front-runner, but Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann was the early favorite with conservatives and the tea party movement. When Bachmann announced in a CNN debate in June that she was jumping into the race, she surged into second place in most polls. In mid-August, Bachmann won the closely watched Iowa straw poll, but that was overshadowed by Perry jumping into the race on the same day. Perry jumped to the top of most national polls shortly after getting into the race. But a couple of lackluster debate performances brought him back into the pack. After Perry\u2019s shaky showing in a debate in Florida late last month, Cain pulled out a surprise win at a Florida GOP straw poll the day after. At the time, GOP activists who voted in the straw poll told CNN they had come ready to vote for Perry but switched to Cain, their second choice in many instances, after Perry faltered in the debate. Perry\u2019s slide in national polling in the past four weeks has been accompanied by an almost point-by-point increase in support for Cain. Cain still faces many challenges and is the target of much criticism.  His \u201c9-9-9\u201d plan has been criticized from both ends of the political spectrum, and he also has been criticized for seeming as interested in promoting his new book as his White House bid. Cain has yet to show fundraising on par with Romney, Perry or Rep. Ron Paul. On the policy front, Ronayne says there are concerns in the GOP base about Cain\u2019s foreign policy chops. Known for his penchant for straight talk on the campaign trail and during the debates, Cain has recently spoken out against the Occupy Wall Street movement, a move that could make him a target of progressives, organized labor and national Democrats as he seeks the Oval Office.  And like Obama before him, Cain may have to negotiate the tricky issue of race as he ascends to the national political stage \u2013 a task made even more treacherous by the GOP\u2019s complicated relationship with the African-American community. At this point, one thing is certain: Cain\u2019s unique mix of biography, oratory, personality and policy has struck a chord with the GOP base \u2013 just as the party\u2019s presidential field seems set. The months ahead before the first votes are cast in the GOP primary race leave plenty of time for the dynamics of the Republican race to change yet again. Cain could fail to consolidate early interest and support with conservatives and see his poll numbers slide as a result, like Bachmann and Perry. For now, Cain is basking in the spotlight of his front-runner status. He is already publicly thinking about who he might tap for the vice presidential spot on the GOP ticket if he is the party\u2019s nominee. Before a recent gathering of social conservatives, Cain told the audience that the rest of the field is afraid, \u201cthat this long shot may not be a long shot any longer.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW:  50 senators voted for the bill, 49 against -- below the threshold for it to proceed Obama says he'll create several smaller jobs bills, each to come up for a vote Congress' failure to pass the bill could help set the stage for the 2012 campaign Republicans oppose the bill's 5.6% surtax on earnings over $1 million Shortly after his $447 billion jobs plan stalled Tuesday in the Senate, President Barack Obama vowed to break the broad initiative down into numerous, separate bills \u2013 potentially setting up even more showdowns between Democrats and Republicans on how to boost the economy and where to get the money to do so. The Democrat-pushed bill failed Tuesday night to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to proceed. A total of 50 members of the chamber supported the measure, while 49 cast ballots against it. In a statement issued Tuesday night, Obama said that despite being an obvious defeat, \u201ctonight\u2019s vote is by no means the end of this fight.\u201d He then outlined his intention to work with Senate Majority Harry Reid and produce several smaller bills derived from the bigger plan. \u201cIn the coming days, members of Congress will have to take a stand on whether they believe we should put teachers, construction workers, police officers and firefighters back on the job,\u201d Obama said in a statement released Tuesday night. \u201cThey\u2019ll get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\u201d The latter issue \u2013 and, more generally, how best to pay for any jobs initiatives \u2013 has been the most contentious in the debate, and the main reason the bill failed to go anywhere in the Senate. Specifically, Republicans vehemently oppose a recently added provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million.  GOP leaders have accused the president of engaging in so-called \u201cclass warfare\u201d for political reasons, while Democrats have called the proposal fair and accused their opponents of taking the side of the rich over the vast majority of Americans. A look at Obama's jobs bill Obama on the American Jobs Act GOP: Course change needed on jobs Gene Sperling: Job numbers small comfort As he has repeatedly in recent weeks, Obama again pressed for Congress on Tuesday night to \u201cmeet their responsibility, put their party politics aside and take action on jobs right now.\u201d With the legislation to be broken down in several pieces, he said that legislators will now be forced to answer to their constituents \u201cwith each vote.\u201d While the vast majority of Senate Democrats voted in favor of the president\u2019s job plan, a few \u2013 including Ben Nelson of Nebraska and John Tester of Montana \u2013 did not.  Tester said, in a prepared statement, that \u201cthe things I support in this bill are outweighed by the things I can\u2019t support,\u201d including \u201csending billions of dollars in bailout aid to states.\u201d The Senate version of the measure has little chance of clearing the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Administration officials had indicated earlier that they were prepared to try to pass the president\u2019s plan in smaller parts, if necessary.  But it is unclear what \u2013 if anything \u2013 a sharply polarized Congress is capable of passing as the election year nears. GOP leaders dismissed the president\u2019s plea, and characterized the plan as little more than a political stunt. \u201cThis whole exercise \u2026 is a charade,\u201d declared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.  \u201cDemocrats have designed this bill to fail.  They\u2019ve designed their own bill to fail in the hopes that anyone who votes against it will look bad for opposing a bill they misleadingly refer to as a \u2018jobs bill.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat matters most to the Democrats \u2026 is that they have an issue to run on next year,\u201d McConnell insisted. Among other things, the package includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits to help the unemployed, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed, and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. But it is the proposed surtax on people earning over $1 million that has emerged as perhaps the most contentious dividing line between the two parties.  The provision was added by key Senate Democrats to make Obama\u2019s bill more acceptable to his own party. Republicans insist the measure would be devastating to small companies. \u201cFour out of five of these so-called millionaires are small businesses\u201d employing over 300,000 people, McConnell claimed last week in an interview on Fox Business Network.  \u201cRaising taxes in the middle of an economic slowdown is a bad idea.\u201d In a speech Tuesday afternoon to a union crowd in Pittsburgh, Obama said that addressing revenue streams is necessary. \u201cIn a perfect world with unlimited resources nobody would have to pay any taxes,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut that\u2019s not the world we live in.  We live in a world where we have to make choices.\u201d Asked last week if he is laying the groundwork to run against a \u201cdo-nothing Congress\u201d \u2013 a reprise of President Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 campaign \u2013 Obama told reporters: \u201cIf Congress does something, then I can\u2019t run against a do-nothing Congress.\u201d But \u201cif Congress does nothing,\u201d he added, \u201cI think the American people will run them out of town.\u201d With the economy remaining shaky and unemployment hovering above 9%, the economy is virtually certain to be the dominant issue of next year\u2019s presidential campaign.  Obama has touted his new plan in a series of campaign-style speeches across the country over the past couple of weeks. \u201cInstead of trying to get compromise, (Obama\u2019s) embracing conflict,\u201d House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The president is \u201crunning around the country campaigning on a bill that he knows won\u2019t pass \u2013 he can\u2019t even get it out of the Senate right now \u2013 rather than working with us on ideas that we agree on that would actually help create jobs.\u201d \u201cWe want to go with ideas that work,\u201d Ryan declared. The largest measure in the package is the expanded payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion.  Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December, and Obama wants to cut the tax in half to 3.1%. Republicans previously embraced the cut, but have increasingly questioned its economic merit. A second key measure \u2013 estimated to cost roughly $44 billion \u2013 is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed.  Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times. McConnell has also blasted the bill as a whole, calling it a rehash of Obama\u2019s 2009 economic stimulus plan.  Democrats insist that measure helped prevent a more serious economic meltdown, while top Republicans have characterized it as a failure that did little beyond adding to the federal government\u2019s skyrocketing debt. \u201cIt reminds me of an old country saying at home that there\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule,\u201d McConnell told Fox.  \u201cOur view is we\u2019ve been there, we\u2019ve done that, we know that doesn\u2019t work and we shouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d The 2009 measure \u201cwas a success in terms of job creation,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, insisted later in the week.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fully appreciated, but the fact is that it made a big difference.\u201d The new proposal \u201cis a much smaller package\u201d but would be \u201ca good start\u201d in terms of job creation, she added.

CNN Red Chair Interview: Herman Cain Herman Cain slams \"Occupy Wall Street\" So what\u2019s behind a rising Cain? On the surface, the spike in his polling comes on the heels of Perry\u2019s meteoric rise and equally meteoric fall. After Perry\u2019s shaky showing in a debate in Florida last month, Cain pulled out a surprise win at a Florida GOP straw poll the day after. At the time, GOP activists who voted in the straw poll told CNN they had come ready to vote for Perry but switched to Cain, their second choice in many instances, after Perry faltered in the debate. Cain\u2019s biography has an inherent appeal \u2013 especially in these tough economic and fiscal times when faith in government and political leaders is at a low. Cain, who is African-American, is not a career politician \u2013 a fact he frequently touts. Instead, he has a business background and is the former CEO of Godfather\u2019s Pizza. And he\u2019s a quintessentially self-made man: He comes from modest working-class roots in Atlanta, and attended college and graduate school in computer science before eventually making his way onto the executive track. Cain is also a survivor of Stage 4 cancer, an experience that has led him to be an outspoken critic of the President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform bill. At the Florida debate three weeks ago, Cain attributed his survival up against daunting odds to the fact that he was able to get the necessary treatment in less than a year\u2019s time. \u201cI\u2019m here five years cancer-free, because I could do it on my timetable and not a bureaucrat\u2019s timetable,\u201d Cain said when asked about an earlier statement that he would have died if the Democratic plan had been in place in 2006 when he was diagnosed. Recently, Cain hosted his own radio talk show in the Atlanta area, potentially giving him a built-in base of supporters in Atlanta\u2019s conservative suburbs. And as his presidential campaign has taken flight, he\u2019s promoted his book, \u201cThis Is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House,\u201d which was released Monday. On the policy front, Cain is the proponent of what he\u2019s dubbed his \u201c9-9-9\u201d plan for reforming the tax code. The plan calls for a 9% federal income tax, a 9% federal corporate tax, and the creation of a new 9% national sales tax. \u201cMy plan is bold,\u201d Cain said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAmerican Morning\u201d soon after his straw poll win, \u201cbecause it throws out the tax code.\u201d He added that \u201c9-9-9\u201d \u201creplaces all of the taxes that now people grapple with and it provides certainty to the business community, which is what they\u2019re looking for in order to grow this economy.\u201d Cain\u2019s biography and tax policy may be playing a role in his recent poll, according to one GOP strategist. \u201cGovernor Romney has solidified his position in the race as one of the front-runners,\u201d said Dan Ronayne, who previously worked for the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and President George W. Bush\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cAnd there appears to be a contest to identify who would be a conservative alternative. Cain has performed very well in the debates and he seems to be solidifying himself in that contest.\u201d Ronayne also observes that \u201cthere is an appetite for someone who is an outsider and someone who can talk about being a job creator.\u201d But, he added, that there is concern among the GOP base about Cain\u2019s readiness on policy issues, particularly foreign policy. Earlier this year, Cain stumbled during a discussion about the Middle East peace process when asked a question on Fox News about the Palestinian right of return. He\u2019s made controversial comments about Islam and Muslims \u2013 comments which forced him to issue a public apology after a visit with Muslim leaders at a mosque in the Washington metro area. And questions remain about his \u201c9-9-9\u201d plan \u2013 like whether it can generate enough revenue to fund the federal government, whether it is politically viable in the current climate with much concern about funding Social Security and Medicare in the decades to come, and whether Americans will go for the idea of a national sales tax. Known for his penchant for straight talk on the campaign trail and during the debates, Cain can also be a bit of an enigma when it comes to Republican orthodoxy. While he expounds policies that seem tailor-made to appeal to the fiscally conscious tea party movement, Cain also is not afraid to break with his party. \u201cWe should not play politics with tragedies,\u201d Cain said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAmerican Morning\u201d during a late September Capitol Hill funding fight over disaster relief precipitated by Republicans in the House. And, orthodoxy aside, Cain is more outspoken than most of his fellow GOP contenders. \u201cDon\u2019t blame Wall Street,\u201d Cain said of the growing \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d movement in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Wednesday, \u201cDon\u2019t blame the big banks. If you don\u2019t have a job and you\u2019re not rich, blame yourself.\u201d Asked Thursday about those comments during a book signing event, Cain didn\u2019t back down. \u201cIf you are envious of somebody who happens to be rich, that you call a fat cat, go and get rich,\u201d Cain said, \u201cinstead of expecting them to walk outside their office and write you a check. That\u2019s not the way America works. Work for it!\u201d While Cain may be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Romney and Perry in recent national polls, he has yet to show either the fundraising muscle or the political organization that are at the disposal of his fellow top-tier rivals. And like Obama before him, Cain may have to negotiate the tricky issue of race as he ascends to the national political stage \u2013 a task made even more treacherous by the GOP\u2019s complicated relationship with the African-American community. At this point, one thing is certain: Cain\u2019s unique mix of biography, oratory, personality and policy is striking a chord with the GOP base just as the Republican White House field is being clarified by the recent decisions of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin not to seek the party\u2019s nod, and by doubts about Perry\u2019s readiness. Another certainty? The months ahead before the first votes are cast in the GOP primary race leave plenty of time for the dynamics of the Republican race to change yet again. Cain could fail to consolidate early interest and support with conservatives and see his poll numbers slide as a result, like Bachmann and Perry. \u201cThere is an awful long way to go,\u201d says Ronayne, who now works in public relations in Washington and isn\u2019t currently supporting any candidate in the GOP race. \u201cIf this was a movie, we haven\u2019t even gotten to the good parts yet. The action is just starting.\u201d",

Brown and Nelson say they oppose the \"millionaire's surtax\" President Obama says he is \"comfortable\" with the surtax If Congress doesn't act, Americans will 'run them out of town,\" Obama says The Senate will vote on the jobs bill next week, Obama says President Barack Obama sent a tough message to Republicans on Thursday, ahead of an expected Senate battle over his $447 billion jobs bill. \u201cAs we look towards next week, any senator out there who\u2019s thinking about voting against this jobs bill when it comes up for a vote needs to explain exactly why they would oppose something that we know would improve our economic situation at such an urgent time for our families and for our businesses,\u201d Obama said at a news conference. The president said the \u201cproblems Europe is having today could have a very real effect on our economy at a time when it\u2019s already fragile.  But this jobs bill can help guard against another downturn if the situation in Europe gets any worse.  It\u2019ll boost economic growth, it\u2019ll put people back to work.\u201d \u201cThis jobs bill is fully paid for by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share,\u201d Obama said.  \u201cSome see this as class warfare.  I see it as a simple choice:  We can either keep taxes exactly as they are for millionaires and billionaires, with loopholes that lead them to have lower tax rates, in some cases, than plumbers and teachers, or we can put teachers and construction workers and veterans back on the job.\u201d The bill introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Wednesday night includes a so-called \u201cmillionaire\u2019s surtax,\u201d a separate 5.6% tax on income over $1 million. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the surtax would raise more than enough to pay for the jobs bill within the required 10-year window. The tax hike would kick in in 2013, rather than 2012 as previously proposed. Obama: 'Too many people hurting' Obama 'fine' with millionaire surtax \u201cIt satisfied our caucus\u2019 desire for this surtax on millionaires to pay for (the jobs plan) and is consistent with the president saying no tax increases in 2012,\u201d a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN. Asked about the surtax, Obama said, \u201cThe approach that the Senate is taking I\u2019m comfortable with, in order to deal with the jobs bill.  We\u2019re still going to need to reform this tax code to make sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes, closing special-interest tax breaks, making sure that the very simple principle, what we call the Buffett rule, which is that millionaires and billionaires aren\u2019t paying lower tax rates than ordinary families \u2013 that that\u2019s in place. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be more work to do with respect to making our tax system fair and just and promoting growth, but in terms of the immediate action of getting this jobs bill passed, I\u2019m fine with the approach that they\u2019re taking.\u201d Republicans struck back. \u201cWe will not stand for a permanent tax hike for a temporary stimulus that is largely a rehash of the same failed stimulus ideas,\u201d the press office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell quoted the Kentucky Republican as saying. House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, released a new \u201cinfographic\u201d arguing that the White House effort to pass the bill includes all sorts of ideas \u2013 but not working with House Republicans. \u201cWith the White House failing to make any headway with job creators, the American people, and Senate Democrats, will President Obama finally work with Republicans to find common ground on removing barriers to job growth?\u201d asks a post written by three people on Boehner\u2019s official blog. Boehner also accused Obama of campaigning for re-election instead of governing. Two key centrist senators announced they oppose the surtax. Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, a moderate Republican who has voted with Democrats and is up for re-election, said he will not support the surtax because he believes it\u2019s being offered by Democrats in a politically inspired environment.  Brown argued that broad tax reform is needed. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a moderate Democrat who often votes against his party and is also up for re-election, said he opposes higher taxes. Obama argued that Congress must act. Asked if he was trying to run against a \u201cdo-nothing Congress,\u201d Obama said: \u201cIf Congress does something, then I can\u2019t run against a do-nothing Congress. \u201cIf Congress does nothing,\u201d the president added, then \u201cI think the American people will run them out of town.\u201d The president acknowledged that \u201cthere is no doubt\u201d that economic growth has slowed and that the economy is \u201cweaker now than it was at the beginning of the year,\u201d when people were more optimistic. The Japanese tsunami; the Arab Spring, which drove up gas prices; and economic problems in Europe have caused concerns, he added. \u201cAnd we did not help here in Washington with the debt ceiling debacle.\u201d Obama said many of the problems the economy faces predate the financial crisis, as middle-class families have seen their wages and incomes remain flat despite rising costs. \u201cSo folks have been struggling not just for the last three years. They\u2019ve been struggling for over a decade,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to take action that is big enough to meet the moment.\u201d Obama also stressed the need for measures to protect Americans from reckless actions by some in the financial sector, and criticized some who have fought regulatory changes \u201cevery inch of the way\u201d and are now pushing for reforms to be rolled back. Banks should not be finding ways to make consumers pay for reforms, such as by inventing new hidden fees, he said, and the government has a role in preventing unfair practices. The president spoke as the protest movement Occupy Wall Street was expanding to other cities. The protesters \u201care giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow,\u201d the president said, but he added that regulations and government oversight are critical. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is not only did the financial sector, with the Republican Party in Congress, fight us every inch of the way, but now you\u2019ve got these same folks suggesting that we should roll back all those reforms and go back to the way it was before the crisis.\u201d The president\u2019s top advisers have said they aim to present a unified Democratic front on jobs.

A 5% surtax on Americans earning $1 million or more per year \u2013 proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, as a means of funding President Barack Obama\u2019s $447 billion jobs bill \u2013 had been planned to take effect in January 2012. Under the new agreement, the surtax would be 5.6%, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN. \u201cIt satisfied our caucus\u2019 desire to for this surtax on millionaires to pay for (the jobs plan) and is consistent with the president saying no tax increases in 2012,\u201d the aide said. Senate Democratic aides told CNN that the timing of Reid\u2019s plan would give Republicans an election-year opening to argue that Obama wants to raise taxes while the economy is still very fragile. The White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to present a unified front against Republicans, who they anticipate will oppose the surtax, and portray them as protecting the wealthy over creating jobs for the middle class, congressional sources told CNN. Earlier Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney signaled Obama was open to negotiation. \u201cThe meat of this legislation, the president\u2019s proposal, are the provisions that put teachers back to work, put construction workers to work, cut taxes for working Americans, incentivize small businesses to grow and hire and increase their wages, and that will be voted on,\u201d Carney said. \u201cHow you pay for it, we\u2019ve always said, was something we were open to negotiate and debate.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, during a photo opportunity earlier Thursday with Honduran President \u2014- Lobo, Obama was asked three times by reporters whether he endorsed Reid\u2019s surtax. He didn\u2019t take the opportunity to do so. The president had proposed raising taxes on individuals making $200,000 or more per year and couples making $250,000 or more, which would take effect in January 2013, two months after the next presidential election.",

The president focused on the $25 billion education component of the plan, which administration officials say would allow for the reconstruction and modernization of 35,000 public schools. \u201cEvery child deserves a great school \u2013 and we can give it to them,\u201d Obama told an enthusiastic crowd at a Denver high school.  \u201cMy question to Congress is:  What on Earth are we waiting for? \u2026 Let\u2019s pass this jobs bill and put teachers back in the classroom where they belong.\u201d On taxes, Obama sought to turn the table on his GOP critics, who have accused the administration of engaging in destructive \u201cclass warfare\u201d politics. \u201cYou know what?

While the president has revved his campaign machine, there are growing indications that he will face tough political headwinds in 2012 due largely to the weak economy. A USA Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday found that 53% of Americans blame Obama a great deal or a moderate amount for the continued economic sluggishness.  The survey of 1,004 adults had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The previous week, a CNN/ORC International poll showed that Obama had a disapproval rating of 55%, the highest of his presidency, mirroring other national polling from Gallup and NBC/Wall Street Journal.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Alan Duke began covering Newt Gingrich during Gingrich\u2019s first campaigns for public office. Newt Gingrich says his daughter's account of his first divorce is correct Gingrich's campaign says he divorced his first wife at her request Court files in Georgia show she asked the judge not to grant the divorce Questions about Gingrich's first divorce have haunted him for decades Newt Gingrich refused Tuesday to discuss in detail the court documents obtained by CNN that appear to contradict his assertion that his first wife sought their divorce in 1980. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Gingrich referred any questions to an online column written by his daughter that stated his ex-wife Jackie Gingrich sought the divorce. The Republican presidential candidate, now in his third marriage, has been peppered with attacks and questions about his divorce from Jackie Gingrich for the past three decades. Questions about his past \u2013 and what that past tells voters about his personal behavior \u2013 have re-emerged as he has returned to the political scene 13 years after he resigned as speaker of the House. Court files cast doubt on Gingrich\u2019s version of first divorce A new defense that has arisen as Gingrich entered the presidential race this year is the insistence that she, not he, wanted the divorce. Differing versions of Gingrich divorce Gingrich first wife didn't want divorce Gingrich liked Romney health plan in '06 Gingrich: Let Congress subpoena judges On the \u201cAnswering the attacks\u201d page of his campaign website, Newt.org, which \u201c(Sets) the Record Straight: Newt\u2019s Positions on the Issues and His Record,\u201d the campaign discusses Gingrich\u2019s first divorce. \u201cIt was (Jackie Gingrich) that requested the divorce, not Newt,\u201d the campaign website said, referring readers to an online column written by Gingrich\u2019s youngest daughter, Jackie Gingrich Cushman, last May. Cushman, 13 when her parents separated in 1980, was rebutting persistent rumors that her father served divorce papers on her mother the day after cancer surgery.  In the column, Cushman writes that papers were never served in the hospital, and that her mother did not actually have cancer. \u201cMy mother and father were already in the process of getting a divorce, which she requested,\u201d Cushman wrote. Gingrich court documents: Original divorce complaint Gingrich court documents: Motion for contempt Gingrich court documents: Petition for modification of alimony In the CNN interview Tuesday, Gingrich said his daughter\u2019s article \u201ccaptures it and that\u2019s the most I\u2019ll say.\u201d Pressed by Blitzer about the court documents, Gingrich added that \u201cthere are a lot of things that are said in divorces that turn out not to be true, and lawyers write lots of things in the middle of fights.\u201d Last week, CNN obtained the folder containing the filings from the 1980 divorce, after initially being told that the divorce documents were sealed. The folder had been stashed away for years in a Carroll County, Georgia, court clerk\u2019s drawer. Retired clerk Kenneth Skinner told CNN his deputy took Gingrich\u2019s file out of the public records room around 1994, \u201cwhen he (Gingrich) became the center of attention,\u201d because Skinner feared tampering and theft. \u201cDuring these years, you had to make sure those papers were there,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cPeople could go in those files and get things out.  We didn\u2019t have enough security to control it.\u201d Current Carroll County Clerk of Court Alan Lee said he called the retired deputy clerk, who told him where to find the papers, after CNN began looking for them last week. The documents, and interviews with people close to the couple at the time, contradict the Gingrich claim about who wanted the divorce. Newt Gingrich filed a divorce complaint on July 14, 1980, in Carroll County, saying that \u201cthe marriage of the parties is irretriebably (sic) broken.\u201d Jackie Battley Gingrich, the congressman\u2019s wife and the mother of Jackie Gingrich Cushman, responded by asking the judge to reject her husband\u2019s filing. \u201cDefendant shows that she has adequate and ample grounds for divorce, but that she does not desire one at this time,\u201d her petition said. Gingrich: I am going to stay positive Gingrich, Perry fail to make Virginia ballot CNN Red Chair Interview: Newt Gingrich \u201cAlthough defendant does not admit that this marriage is irretrievably broken, defendant has been hopeful that an arrangement for temporary support of defendant and the two minor daughters of the parties could be mutually agreed upon without the intervention of this court,\u201d her petition said.  \u201cAll efforts to date have been unsuccessful.\u201d When CNN presented the information found in the divorce file to the Gingrich campaign, its spokesman stood by the contention that it was Gingrich\u2019s ex-wife who asked for the divorce in 1980. \u201cCarroll County Georgia court documents accurately show Newt Gingrich filed for a divorce from his wife Jackie Battley, but it was Jackie Battley who requested the divorce,\u201d spokesman R.C. Hammond said in an e-mail to CNN Saturday.  \u201cGingrich, her husband, obtained legal counsel and filed the divorce papers initiating the legal proceedings.\u201d \u201cIt was the same legal proceedings that determined and set the amounts of payments Gingrich would provide to support his two daughters,\u201d Hammond said. Atlanta divorce lawyer Jim Peterson, who was not involved in the Gingrich proceedings, said the wife\u2019s divorce filings make it \u201cpretty plain\u201d that she did not want the divorce. \u201cShe obviously didn\u2019t want the divorce, on the face of the pleadings,\u201d Peterson said. One reason a defendant in a divorce would deny it was irretrievably broken would be \u201cto make you stay in the marriage and put the screws to you to make it as difficult as they possibly can,\u201d Peterson added. Jackie Gingrich, who has rarely spoken to the media about the divorce, declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview.  A friend said that Jackie Gingrich did not want to comment out of concern for her daughters and grandchildren. In a brief interview in 1985, she told the Washington Post: \u201cHe can say that we had been talking about it for 10 years, but the truth is that it came as a complete surprise.\u201d Wives take lead in candidates\u2019 ads Leonard H.  \u201cKip\u201d Carter, a former close Gingrich friend, backed the contention that it was Newt Gingrich who wanted the divorce. \u201cHe (Gingrich) said, \u2018You know and I know that she\u2019s not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of a president,\u2019 \u201d Carter, who now lives in South Carolina, told CNN recently, relating the conversation he had with Gingrich the day Gingrich revealed he was filing for divorce.  Carter served as treasurer of Gingrich\u2019s first congressional campaigns. Carter, who was a fellow history professor when Gingrich taught at West Georgia College in Carrollton, said he broke off his friendship with Newt Gingrich because of the congressman\u2019s treatment of his wife during the divorce. Asked in an e-mail whether that conversation in 1980 occurred the way that Carter recounted, Gingrich spokesman Hammond did not respond. Gerald Johnson, a Georgia state legislator at the time who also was in Gingrich\u2019s Sunday school class, said it was his memory that Jackie Gingrich did not want a divorce. Johnson laughed when told the presidential campaign is now saying she requested the divorce, calling that \u201csurprising.\u201d When Gingrich filed for divorce, he was already seeing a 28-year-old congressional aide, whom he married six months after his divorce was final in 1981. The second wife, Marianne Ginther Gingrich, told Esquire magazine last year that Gingrich even introduced her to his parents in the summer of 1980, the same time he filed for divorce. \u201cThey were thrilled because they hadn\u2019t wanted Newt to marry (Jackie Battley),\u201d she told Esquire. Gingrich divorced Marianne Gingrich 19 years later, after an affair with a younger congressional aide whom he married soon after his divorce.  The third wife, Callista Bisek Gingrich, is now a major figure in his presidential campaign. Gingrich: I wouldn\u2019t vote for Ron Paul Jackie Gingrich Cushman wrote in May that she and her older sister, Kathy Gingrich Lubbers, \u201cwill not answer additional questions or make additional comments regarding this meaningless incident.\u201d Both sisters are actively involved in Gingrich\u2019s campaign for the Republican nomination. The court documents obtained by CNN also shed light on the issue of the first-term congressman\u2019s record of offering support for Jackie Gingrich and the two girls during the separation and after the divorce. The same court filing in which Jackie Gingrich told the judge she did not want the divorce also accused Gingrich of failing to provide enough money for her and her two then-teenaged daughters to live on during their separation. Kathy was 17 at the time. \u201cDespite repeated notice to plaintiff and requests by defendant, plaintiff has failed and refused to voluntarily provide reasonable support sufficient to include payment of usual and normal living expenses, including drugs, water, sewage, garbage, gas, electric and telephone service for defendant and the minor children,\u201d she said in court documents.  \u201cAs a result, many of such accounts are two or three months past due with notices of intent to cut off service and gas and electricity.\u201d When Jackie Gingrich and her daughters moved from their other home in Fairfax, Virginia, back to their house in Carrollton, Georgia, there were \u201cno lights, no heat, no water, no food in the home,\u201d former Gingrich friend and academic colleague Carter said. Carter, who helped collect donations for the family, said Gingrich \u201cwouldn\u2019t give them a dime\u201d in the first months of the separation. \u201cWe had a food drive at First Baptist Church,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe deacons went down and stocked her pantry.\u201d Johnson, the former state legislator who was in Gingrich\u2019s Sunday school class, said when the church\u2019s minister asked him to donate money, he gave $100 to the fund. A judge ordered Gingrich to appear in court a week after his wife filed her complaint. The result was a ruling that he bring the utility bills up to date and begin paying his wife $700 a month in temporary support until the case was settled. Both sides reached an agreement three months later, avoiding the jury trial that Jackie Gingrich was demanding. Newt Gingrich on CNN Election Center In 1994, Gingrich agreed to increase his alimony payments by $350 to $1,650 a month.  In exchange, Jackie Gingrich waived her right to ask for future increases if her ex-husband\u2019s income increased.  Gingrich is still paying alimony. \u201cWhen asked, Gingrich has admitted he has not led a perfect life and has at times had to go to God for forgiveness,\u201d Hammond said.  \u201cOver 30 years later, the family has long put these matters behind them.\u201d Johnson, who later challenged Gingrich in the 1984 congressional race, said the divorce and controversy over the support payments caused a lot of negative feelings against Gingrich in his home county. \u201cI think the thing that bothered people most was everybody in Carrollton knew how much Jackie sacrificed to get Newt elected,\u201d Johnson said. CNN asked Gingrich spokesman Hammond in an e-mail about the allegation made by Jackie Gingrich in her October 1980 court filing that Gingrich was not supporting his family during this period, but the statement the campaign released did not directly address that question. Still, Johnson said there should be forgiveness and he would like to see Gingrich win the White House. Newt Gingrich claims that it was his first wife, not Gingrich himself, who wanted their divorce in 1980, but court documents obtained by CNN appear to show otherwise.",

            "article_content": "Obama may be preparing to run against a \"do nothing\" Congress in 2012 Harry Truman famously ran against a \"do nothing\" GOP Congress in 1948 -- and won The current Congress has compiled a record of few legislative accomplishments Dust off the Truman playbook. After a year of repeated partisan showdowns between the White House and Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama appears ready to hit the campaign trail in 2012 with congressional Republicans firmly in his sights \u2013 a reprise of Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 come-from-behind strategy against Tom Dewey and the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d 80th Congress. \u201cI would love nothing more than to see Congress act so aggressively that I can\u2019t campaign against them as a do-nothing Congress,\u201d Obama told reporters back in October. But people \u201care very skeptical about Congress\u2019s ability to act right now. \u2026 The American people are very frustrated.  They\u2019ve been frustrated for a long time. They don\u2019t get a sense that folks in this town are looking out for their interests.\u201d Two months later, little appears to have changed. Congress, saddled with record low approval ratings, limped out of Washington last week with one of the least distinguished legislative records in modern memory. Explain it to me: Presidential campaigns Obama embraces his youngest fans New Obama campaign theme? Strictly by the numbers, the charge that this is a do-nothing Congress appears justified. As of the start of December, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives had passed 326 bills, the lowest number in at least the last 10 nonelection years, according to a Congressional Record tally cited recently in the Washington Post. The Senate had passed 368 measures, its lowest total since 1995, the Post noted. As of early December, Obama signed 62 bills, according to the Post, compared with 88 for Bill Clinton in 1995 after the last Republican takeover of the House. What exactly were this year\u2019s legislative highlights? Narrowly avoiding a government shutdown, barely avoiding a default on the national debt, and squeezing through a two-month extension of an average $80 monthly cut in the payroll tax. In April, Congress passed a measure cutting $38.5 billion in spending. Some conservatives, however, felt that wasn\u2019t enough. Others later felt misled when a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis revealed that only a small fraction of the cuts would take effect in the current fiscal year. \u201cTotal nonsense,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said at the time. \u201cA cut is a cut.\u201d The summer\u2019s debt ceiling debate produced a lot of talk about a so-called \u201cgrand bargain\u201d between Democrats and Republicans that would generate $4 trillion in deficit reduction while tackling politically sensitive entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. But Boehner reportedly pulled the plug when his GOP caucus balked at the prospect of raising taxes on the wealthy as part of the deal. Republicans, who were savaged by Democrats after Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, unveiled a budget plan incorporating major Medicare changes, argued Obama was never serious about entitlement reform. The debt ceiling debate ended with a more modest agreement to cut roughly $900 billion in discretionary spending over the next decade while creating a 12-member bipartisan \u201csuper committee\u201d to find at least another $1.2 trillion in savings. After weeks of contentious negotiations, the panel failed to reach its goal \u2013 still more proof of congressional dysfunction, analysts said. The fallback plan enacted in the event of a super committee failure calls for $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts over the next decade, including $600 billion from the Pentagon. Hawkish Republicans are already pushing to undo the defense cuts \u2013 something Obama promises to oppose. Finally there was December\u2019s payroll tax standoff, widely seen as a win for Democrats on an issue \u2013 taxes \u2013 that has historically favored the GOP.  Republican leaders first questioned the merit of the tax holiday and then complained that anything less than a yearlong extension would be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Obama, meanwhile, used the standoff to portray the Republicans as defenders of the rich who care little about the economic strains facing the middle class. Ultimately, Congress kicked the can down the road, opting for a two-month extension after conservative leaders in the Senate and elsewhere complained that House Republicans were bungling the issue. The episode raised fresh questions about Boehner\u2019s control over the House Republican caucus. The speaker, according to several accounts, initially favored the two-month extension, which had passed the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. He retreated from that position in the face of a tea party-fueled revolt, but flipped yet again after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and others complained. Bucking the Senate \u201cmay not have been politically the smartest thing in the world,\u201d Boehner conceded. Conservative freshman Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, later told CNN he was \u201cdisappointed in our entire (GOP) leadership team.\u201d One silver lining: Congress did manage in October to approve free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.  That\u2019s small potatoes, however, compared with the record of Truman\u2019s \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Republican Congress, which passed Cold War aid to Greece and Turkey, the Marshall Plan for Europe, Taft-Hartley labor law reforms, and legislation creating the CIA. That Congress also changed the presidential succession law and limited future presidents to two terms, among other things. In fairness, the 112th Congress still has another year to go. But given their current track record and with an election now looming, this group of legislators seems likely to wind up as little more than a campaign trail punch line.",

            "article_content": "What does $40 mean in your household? Let us know in a short video. NEW: The House and the Senate are to take up the compromise Friday Boehner says opposing the Senate's two-month plan was not politically smart Obama urges Congress to negotiate a one-year extension when it returns The payroll tax cut is set to expire December 31 A compromise measure to extend the payroll tax cut for two months comes before the House and Senate on Friday after Speaker John Boehner dropped his opposition under mounting pressure from the White House, congressional Democrats and fellow Republicans. Both chambers will be asked to give unanimous consent, a procedural move that would allow the measure to pass even though most members will be home for the holidays. If no one shows up to object in person, the plan originally worked out by the Senate and modified slightly Thursday to get the support of Boehner and House Republicans would go to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk. Obama has promised to sign it, as well as a separate appropriations bill to fund the government through September 2012, before heading off to Hawaii to join his family for the holidays. What the payroll tax deal would do Deal extends tax cut for two months Bachmann: Tax cuts 'temporary gimmick' The agreement represented a symbolic triumph for the president, who pushed hard for extending the payroll tax cut as part of his jobs package and rallied public support for his stance. While the two-month extension was shorter than desired, Obama urged congressional leaders to follow through on their stated intention to negotiate a one-year extension that all parties have said they favor. \u201cToday\u2019s victory is yours,\u201d Obama said in a tweet to followers Thursday night. \u201cKeep making your voices heard \u2013 it makes all the difference.\u201d Under the deal, the payroll tax will remain at the current 4.2% rate instead of reverting to the 6.2% rate it was at before the cut enacted last year. Without congressional action, the higher rate would have returned in 2012, meaning an average $1,000 tax increase for 160 million Americans. The agreement also includes the addition of legislative language to ease the administrative burden on small businesses implementing the plan, and a commitment to the negotiations on a one-year extension of the payroll tax cut as well as other benefits, according to statements by congressional leaders and Obama. Boehner succumbed Thursday to calls from across the political spectrum for House Republicans to stop blocking congressional approval of the Senate-passed measure. While minor changes were made to the Senate plan, Thursday\u2019s agreement produced essentially the same proposal as the one the Senate passed last Saturday in an 89-10 vote, with strong Republican support. A House GOP uprising during a caucus conference call Saturday caused Boehner to reject the Senate plan, setting up this week\u2019s political showdown in the final days before the payroll tax rate was set to rise. According to GOP sources, another conference call Thursday involved Boehner describing the terms of the agreement without allowing any members to ask questions or raise objections. One Republican House member on the call described Boehner as \u201ctired and ticked off.\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, then announced the deal to reporters, calling the House GOP\u2019s prior opposition to the Senate plan the right thing to do, even if politically questionable. \u201cIt may not have been politically the smartest thing in the world,\u201d Boehner said, but the end result was \u201cwe were able to fix what came out of the Senate.\u201d The speaker also acknowledged the pressure he was under, saying: \u201cI talked to enough members over the last 24 hours who say we don\u2019t like the two-month extension and if you can get this fixed, why not do the right thing for the American people even if it\u2019s not exactly what we want.\u201d Analysts said Boehner had little choice but to back down. \u201cIt became increasingly obvious he had to fold,\u201d said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, using poker terminology. Boehner was under \u201cintense pressure from senior Republicans\u201d over a situation that \u201cbecame so botched,\u201d Gergen said. Darrell West , the  vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the issue has worked in the favor of Democrats because they had Republicans \u201cseemingly willing to accept a tax increase\u201d by opposing the Senate extension of the payroll tax cut. \u201cAny time you can get the other party in opposition to its own stated principles, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d West said. The ongoing impasse pitting the House Republican leadership against the White House, congressional Democrats and fellow Republicans was the kind of political gamesmanship that Americans dislike about Congress, Obama said earlier Thursday. The two-month Senate compromise was passed after Senate negotiators were unable to agree on a one-year extension. But Boehner demanded negotiations on a one-year extension, arguing that anything shorter would simply prolong the issue and cause uncertainty for American taxpayers and businesses. His stance drew sharp criticism this week, including an editorial in the conservative Wall Street Journal that said House Republicans had lost the political advantage of advocating tax cuts to Obama and the Democrats. Gergen: Winds shift toward Obama On Thursday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also called for Boehner to accept a short-term extension, and similar statements by other conservative Republicans showed the tide turning against Boehner and his GOP leaders. Meanwhile, conservative Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Nebraska, and Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisconsin, added their voices to GOP calls for House Republicans to relent in their standoff. \u201cWhile I would prefer a year-long tax holiday, I refuse to let anyone play games with my constituents who stand to face a significant tax hike if we don\u2019t act,\u201d Duffy said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I will support any option to extend the payroll tax cut.\u201d Obama, meanwhile, reiterated the Democratic position in a phone call with Boehner Thursday morning, stating that the House should pass the Senate\u2019s two-month extension and then negotiators should get to work on a longer-term deal. The president also met with a group of middle-class Americans as part of a White House attempt to illustrate the impact on 160 million American workers if the tax holiday ends December 31. The typical worker\u2019s take home salary will shrink by about $40 per pay period without the tax cut. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the House to listen \u2026 to the voices all across the country and reconsider,\u201d Obama said.  \u201cI am ready to sign that (Senate) compromise into law the second it lands on my desk.\u201d Obama blamed the impasse on \u201ca faction of House Republicans\u201d that refused to support the Senate compromise, even though leaders of both parties had insisted they wanted to extend the payroll tax cut. He prompted laughter by adding: \u201cHas this place become so dysfunctional that even when people agree to things we can\u2019t do it?  It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, reinforcing Obama\u2019s stance, released a statement promising that he will be \u201chappy to restart the negotiating process to forge a year-long extension\u201d as soon as the House passes the Senate\u2019s compromise plan. Many in the GOP fear the issue damaged the party\u2019s anti-tax reputation heading into the 2012 campaign. Pushed by his conservative, tea party-infused House GOP caucus, Boehner had continued to insist that anything short of an immediate 12-month extension of the tax holiday would only create more economic instability and do little to generate job growth. Also at stake: extended emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so-called \u201cdoc fix,\u201d a delay in scheduled pay cuts to Medicare physicians. Both of those measures, along with the tax holiday, were scheduled to expire in nine days. All top Democrats and Republicans publicly agreed on the need for a one-year extension, but critics of the House GOP\u2019s stance insisted that the Senate\u2019s two-month extension was necessary to give negotiators more time to hammer out a deal over how to pay for the continuation. They accused House Republicans of creating the very instability they had railed against, and of needlessly creating yet another congressional crisis at the end of a year filled with Capitol Hill showdowns. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, strongly criticized the House GOP\u2019s stance on CNN\u2019s \u201cAmerican Morning\u201d Thursday. \u201cThe Republicans are losing this fight.  We need to get back on track,\u201d McCain said.  \u201cA thousand dollars a year is a big amount of money to most Americans, and I think it\u2019s very important. \u2026 I worry about the fact that we are continuing to increase the debt and the deficit, but now it\u2019s become very symbolic, and I think it has to be done.\u201d The Wall Street Journal editorial, normally a conservative political platform, blasted Boehner and his House GOP colleagues, arguing that they had \u201cachieved the small miracle of letting Mr. Obama position himself as an election-year tax cutter.\u201d \u201cAt this stage, Republicans would do best to cut their losses and find a way to extend the payroll holiday quickly,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial writers said. Numerous Senate Republicans have indicated they felt politically undercut by their House colleagues after agreeing to the two-month compromise negotiated by McConnell and Reid. A number of Republicans have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by Obama \u2013 as part of the payroll tax cut package \u2013 to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans and some Democratic union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs; critics question its environmental impact. A failure to act could have had major political fallout.  Numerous observers believe Obama is preparing to parrot Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 campaign next year by running against an unpopular, dysfunctional Congress controlled partly by the GOP.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama to speak on impasse Obama calls Boehner, Reid to urge adoption of Senate's two-month extension Senate GOP aide says House Republicans have \"painted themselves into a corner\" Obama says the bipartisan compromise reached Saturday is the only viable option President Barack Obama is expected to make a statement Thursday on the partisan standoff over how best to extend the expiring payroll tax cut, according to the White House. Obama will be joined by \u201cAmericans who would see their taxes go up if the House Republicans fail to act,\u201d the White House said. Some of those people have participated in Obama\u2019s social media campaign highlighting what a $40 loss to a paycheck can mean to the average American. Wednesday, the president called House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to discuss the impasse, the White House said. A two-month extension passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support by the Democratic-controlled Senate \u201cis the only option to ensure that middle class families aren\u2019t hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full year solution,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. Earlier in the day, Boehner, R-Ohio, and House GOP negotiators urged Democrats to restart talks on the matter, with the goal of an immediate one-year extension. \u201cWe\u2019re here. We\u2019re ready to work,\u201d Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe can resolve these differences \u2026 and give the American people a real Christmas present.\u201d During their phone call, Boehner told Obama that House Republicans were \u201celected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year,\u201d an aide to the speaker said. At stake:  A tax cut for 160 million Americans, as well as extended emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so-called \u201cdoc fix,\u201d a delay in significant scheduled pay cuts to Medicare physicians. All three measures are currently scheduled to expire December 31. Despite mounting pressure on House Republicans to give in and pass a short-term extension, a well- placed House GOP source indicated his side would not consider an end-game to the standoff until next week, just days before the deadline for taxes to go up. White House: Congress inaction a threat to the economy A growing number of political observers believe Democrats hold the political high ground in the struggle, and that Republicans are in the midst of squandering their long-held advantage on the tax issue.  On Saturday, the Senate voted 89-10 to approve two additional months for all three programs. The idea, leaders have repeatedly said, is to buy more time to hammer out a longer-term deal. The conservative House GOP caucus, however, revolted against that blueprint, calling it an inadequate patchwork plan that will create more economic instability and do little to create jobs. On Tuesday, the House voted 229-193 on a virtual party-line basis to express its disagreement with the Senate plan and call for the creation of a House-Senate conference committee to resolve the matter \u2013 something already ruled out by Reid, D-Nevada. The $33 billion \u201cbipartisan compromise that was reached on Saturday is the only viable way to prevent a tax hike on January 1,\u201d Obama said after the House vote.  \u201cIt\u2019s the only one.\u201d The House also approved a separate resolution supporting a year-long extension of both the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment benefits, along with a new, two-year doc fix.  There is no indication, however, that congressional negotiators would be able to reach a bipartisan agreement by the end of the year. Further complicating matters is the fact that the Senate has adjourned for the year.  Most House members also left Washington after Tuesday\u2019s vote. Dispute creates GOP split between House and Senate Boehner released a public letter to Obama Tuesday urging him to order the Senate back from its holiday break to take part in further talks \u2013 a gesture immediately rejected by the White House. In a symbolic move, Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Democratic leadership, walked onto the floor of a virtually empty House chamber Wednesday morning to call for the House to hold a direct, up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Senate plan.  Boehner prevented a direct vote on the Senate bill Tuesday, signaling that House GOP leaders may lack enough Republican support to defeat it in the face of unrelenting pressure from the White House, congressional Democrats and some Senate Republicans. The Wall Street Journal \u2013 always a critical sounding board for conservatives \u2013 blasted Boehner and his House GOP colleagues in an editorial Wednesday, arguing that they had \u201cachieved the small miracle of letting Mr. Obama position himself as an election-year tax cutter.\u201d \u201cAt this stage, Republicans would do best to cut their losses and find a way to extend the payroll holiday quickly,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial writers said. \u201cThen go home and return in January with a united House-Senate strategy that forces Democrats to make specific policy choices that highlight the differences between the parties on spending, taxes and regulation. \u2026 The alternative is more chaotic retreat and the return of all-Democratic rule.\u201d Asked to respond to the editorial, Boehner insisted that the GOP remains \u201cthe party of lower taxes for the American people.\u201d Boehner\u2019s response did not appear to stem a rising tide of criticism from his Senate counterparts. \u201cThe House Republicans have painted themselves into a corner.  They are on their own,\u201d a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN Wednesday.  \u201cThis is a lose-lose situation for us.  (House Republicans) let the Democrats get the messaging advantage and, more specifically, we\u2019ve turned one of our key issues on its head. The Republicans look like they are the ones blocking tax relief.\u201d \u201cWhen you are arguing process, you are losing, by definition,\u201d the aide said.  \u201cWe are arguing process while they\u2019ve got politics on their side.\u201d A number of Republicans have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by Obama \u2013 as part of the payroll tax cut package \u2013 to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans and some Democratic union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs; critics question its environmental impact. According to House Republican sources, their strategy is now to generate as much news coverage as possible of their eight appointed conferees in coming days to keep the pressure on Democrats to negotiate. \u201cWe are going to try to remind people that we are still in town ready to work,\u201d one House GOP leadership aide said. A failure to act could have major economic and political fallout. The payroll tax break alone is worth roughly $1,000 a year for an average family.  Numerous observers believe Obama is preparing to parrot Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 campaign next year by running against an unpopular, dysfunctional Congress controlled partly by the GOP.

Openly speculating in a CBS interview on the GOP\u2019s strategy, Obama said Republications decided: \u201cOur best bet is to stand on the sidelines because we think the economy is going to get worse and, some point, just blame him (Obama).\u201d \u201cSo we haven\u2019t gotten the kind of engagement that I would have liked, \u201d Obama said in the interview that aired Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The president tried to frame what he predicted will be a \u201cgreat debate\u201d next year, when he\u2019s up for re-election, as a \u201cstark\u201d choice between \u201ca system in which the people who have benefited the most (should) do a little bit more, or they (should) not.\u201d \u201cDo they think that cutting taxes further \u2013 including on the wealthy (and) cutting taxes on corporations \u2013 gutting regulations: Do we think that is going to be more successful?\u201d Obama asked rhetorically. \u201cIf the American people think that\u2019s going to be the recipe for success \u2026 then I am going to lose.\u201d The president lamented what he described as a lack of \u201chonest conversation about the greatest income inequality since the 1920s\u201d or who and what was responsible for \u201cthe worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\u201d He dismissed Republican criticisms he has been engaging in class warfare or promoting socialism. Focusing on making life easier, fairer and more prosperous for middle class citizens should be a shared goal, the president said. Obama urges payroll tax cut extension Santorum: Obama foreign policy weak \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the bargain, what\u2019s happened to the American deal that says we\u2019re focused on building a strong middle class?\u201d Obama said. Recent polls suggest that the president\u2019s approach is not resoundingly resonating among the American public. His disapproval ratings in two polls taken last week \u2013 from Gallup and Rasmussen \u2013 were at 50% or higher, for instance. Obama said that such sentiments are to be expected, given that economy is not \u201cmoving in a way that benefits everybody, as opposed to just a few.\u201d And he also said that it would take many years, and perhaps multiple presidents, to turn around the economy and change the culture in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m the captain \u2026 on the ship, and it\u2019s going through really bad storms,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we\u2019d done the right things, if people\u2019s reality right now is still difficult, they\u2019re going to be frustrated.\u201d At the same time, the president gave no indication that his policies hadn\u2019t been universally successful \u2013 from stimulus and other efforts to prevent an economic depression, to new financial regulations, the auto bailout and health care reform. \u201cWe did all the right things to prevent another Great Depression and to get the economy growing again, and to get job creation again,\u201d said Obama, noting the economy has grown for each of the past nine quarters. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t made up for the hole that was created in the six, nine, 12 months before my economic policies took effect.\u201d The president suggested it didn\u2019t matter who emerged from the Republican primary as his 2012 challenger, saying that all the candidates share the same \u201ccore philosophy.\u201d Still, he did characterize the two front-runners by name as veteran politicians. \u201c(Former House Speaker Newt) Gingrich is somebody who has been around a long time and is good on TV and is good in debates,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut (former Massachusetts Gov.) Mitt Romney has shown himself (as being) good at politics as well. He\u2019s had a lot of practice at it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Failure of \"super committee\" isn't surprising given Congress' track record, writer says The public -- reluctant to make tough choices -- also shares the blame, he says Closing popular but costly tax loopholes is extremely tough to do politically Democrats and Republicans both likely to lose politically from super committee's failure So the \u201csuper committee\u201d failed. Can you honestly say you were expecting a different outcome? The inability of an evenly split panel of Capitol Hill Democrats and Republicans to agree on $1.2 trillion in savings is about as surprising as January snow in Fairbanks, Alaska. Elected officials in Washington can\u2019t even pass a budget anymore, much less agree on politically tough choices about taxes and spending. \u201cThe failure of the super committee is not just a failure of 12 members of Congress, who I believe genuinely tried to cut a deal but were rebuffed by their party leaders.  It is a failure of political leadership on both sides of the partisan aisle,\u201d said Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller. \u201cBoth parties chose their own electoral livelihoods over the good of the country, and it is outright shameful. \u2026 This might be the most self-serving, mediocre and uncaring set of legislators in Congress in the last 50 years.\u201d Overheard on CNN.com: Readers angry at outcome Sessions: U.S. has 'a right to be angry' Super committee promised not to fail Sen. Kerry: Job didn't get done Murray: Committee will keep working But if you\u2019re ready to hand our dysfunctional Congress a one-way ticket to political oblivion, don\u2019t forget to leave room on the bus for the American public. Americans voted them into office, and polls show they\u2019re pretty much doing what Americans want. Yet in the failure of the moment, there may be an opening for Barack Obama to show new presidential leadership, Schiller noted. Ask most budget analysts for the cause of America\u2019s ballooning debt \u2013 $15 trillion and counting \u2013 and they\u2019ll note the toxic combination of skyrocketing entitlement costs, defense spending that dwarfs that of any other nation on the planet and the Bush-era tax cuts. To close the gap, Democrats generally push tax increases, and Republicans argue for spending cuts. The public, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t seem wild about virtually anything. While six in 10 Americans say they embrace \u201cmajor cuts\u201d to spending programs, in reality people flinch when it comes to reductions in the largest, most popular programs. Fifty-seven percent of Americans oppose major changes to Medicare and Social Security, while 60% oppose major cuts in Pentagon spending, according to a November 18-20 CNN/ORC International Poll. Nearly 90% of Americans oppose higher taxes on the middle class, the poll shows. \u201cPolls have indicated that Americans favor cuts in small programs like foreign aid that make up a tiny fraction of the overall federal budget, but they oppose changes to the big-ticket items like Social Security or the military,\u201d said Keating Holland, CNN polling director.  \u201cThat\u2019s been true for decades. What\u2019s new are the external pressures to reduce the federal deficit, but it\u2019s unclear that the public feels the same urgency that the financial markets do.\u201d The one idea that wins solid majority support from the electorate is higher taxes on wealthier Americans and businesses. Roughly two in three Americans back the idea, according to the survey. Poll: Americans are split like debt panel Ending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest would generate an estimated $800 billion, two-thirds of the super committee\u2019s minimum goal. Democrats note that Bush himself argued for tax cuts in 2001 because there was a budget surplus at the time. \u201cThe people of America have been overcharged, and, on their behalf, I\u2019m here asking for a refund,\u201d Bush told Congress at the time. But over the last couple of decades, tax increases on the rich \u2013 \u201cjob creators\u201d in GOP lingo \u2013 have become politically radioactive to most congressional Republicans. When super committee member Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, bucked the trend by proposing the elimination of $250 billion in tax deductions, 72 House Republicans signed a letter declaring their opposition to any deal including tax increases. Grover Norquist: Democrats are lying Not surprisingly, the Republican presidential candidates are firmly in tune with their base.  Asked at an August debate if they could support a deal including $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases, everyone said no. Closing tax loopholes and simplifying the tax code is increasingly a focal point in Washington. But here\u2019s the problem: Everybody loves the most expensive loopholes. One of the biggest of all is tax-free, employer-provided health care benefits. They\u2019ll cost the federal government about $650 billion between 2010 and 2014, according to the head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. How about shielding certain pension contributions and earnings from Uncle Sam? Roughly $600 billion over the same five years. And America\u2019s sacrosanct home mortgage interest deduction? That will run about $500 billion. Close all three of these loopholes and you get more than $1.7 trillion in new revenue over five years \u2013 well in excess of the super committee\u2019s goal of $1.2 trillion over a decade. But good luck pushing for that kind of change.  Obama took his 2008 Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, to the political cleaners for backing an end to the employer health care loophole. And what about Obama\u2019s call to close a tax loophole for corporate jet owners? Republicans finally agreed to it as part of a last-ditch offer to the super committee. Unfortunately, the measure is only worth $3 billion over 10 years \u2013 a mere drop in the deficit reduction bucket. Super committee: What\u2019s next Meanwhile, the administration remains exceedingly cautious about embracing entitlement reform. Obama notably declined to back the recommendations of his Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction commission, which pushed for controversial changes to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Politically, does either party stand to gain from the super committee fiasco? Some Republicans accuse Obama of rooting for failure to reinforce the administration\u2019s narrative that it\u2019s impossible to work with extremist Republicans.  Some Democrats say Republicans are trying to wash their hands of any responsibility for the economy and Washington\u2019s dysfunction in the run-up to 2012. David Gergen: Have they gone nuts in Washington? Schiller says Obama does have \u201can opening to show presidential leadership\u201d by presenting a new plan of his own. \u201cHe could take both parts of what was deemed acceptable in theory to committee members and present Congress with that package in January,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comes with risk, but it sets him up as dominating the budget agenda for the year, and insulates him from charges of failure to lead.\u201d But the most likely outcome, she stressed, is that both sides will lose. \u201cCongress underestimates the American people if they think they can get away with doing nothing and come out looking good. The only people who will react well to this might be senior citizens and hard-core members of the tea party,\u201d she said. But \u201cyou can\u2019t win an election on either side with just those constituent groups.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. McCain criticizes Obama, says he's campaigning on a taxpayer-funded trip President launches a three-day visit to North Carolina and Virginia The two states are key battlegrounds in the presidential race The White House has called on Congress to pass the jobs bill incrementally President Barack Obama took the push for his stalled $447 billion jobs plan to North Carolina on Monday, telling two audiences that alternative proposals put forward by his Republican critics amount to little more than sops to the rich that will gut critical regulations and fail to restore economic growth. My \u201cbill will help put people back to work and give our economy a boost right away,\u201d Obama told a morning crowd at Asheville Regional Airport. \u201cBut apparently, none of this matters\u201d to GOP leaders. \u201cI\u2019ve gone out of my way to find areas of cooperation\u201d with congressional Republicans, the president declared. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give members of Congress another chance to step up to the plate and do the right thing.\u201d But \u201cif they vote against these proposals again \u2026 then they\u2019re not going to have to answer to me. They\u2019re going to have to answer to you,\u201d he said. Competing jobs plans GOP announces Jobs Through Growth Act Obama 'will not take no' on jobs bill Later Monday, Obama told students at West Wilkes High School in Millers Creek that  Republican opposition to his plan \u201cmakes no sense,\u201d and he criticized the GOP alternative proposal as an attempt to satisfy the party\u2019s conservative wing. \u201cIt\u2019s way overdue for us to stop trying to satisfy some branch of the party and take some common-sense steps to help\u201d the economy and the nation, he said to a cheering crowd. Since Obama\u2019s plan was rejected in the Senate \u2013 due to unanimous GOP opposition \u2013 Democratic leaders have decided to try to move it through Congress by breaking it up into a series of smaller legislative proposals. But his appearance, analysts note, was as much about campaign politics as the bill.  The president will spend the next three days on a bus tour through politically pivotal North Carolina and Virginia \u2013 two states carried by Obama in 2008 but considered up for grabs next year. Veteran Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 election, criticized the president Monday for using the taxpayer-funded trip for what McCain called political campaigning. \u201cOn the taxpayer-paid dime, the president is now traveling, attacking the Republican plan,\u201d McCain said on the Senate floor. While noting Obama\u2019s right to level such criticism in a political venue, McCain added: \u201cIs that appropriate on the taxpayer\u2019s dime, since it is clearly campaigning?\u201d In Asheville, the crowd repeatedly chanted \u201cfour more years\u201d before and during Obama\u2019s remarks. \u201cI appreciate the \u2018four more years,\u2019 but right now, I\u2019m thinking about the next 13 months,\u201d the president said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait.  We\u2019ve got a choice right now.\u201d Obama\u2019s senior strategist David Axelrod vowed Sunday that every part of the bill will reach a vote. The American people support every single plank of that bill, and we\u2019re going to vote on every single one of them,\u201d Axelrod said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d He would not say which part of the $447 billion plan would come first. \u201cIn the coming days, members of Congress will have to take a stand on whether they believe we should put teachers, construction workers, police officers and firefighters back on the job,\u201d he said in a statement Tuesday.  \u201cThey\u2019ll get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\u201d Meanwhile, demonstrators in Southern California said they\u2019d gather Monday to protest the GOP\u2019s stance on the president\u2019s jobs bill.  House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and California Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce will be together in the area for a fundraising event. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, meanwhile, indicated there could be agreement on some elements. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said over the weekend that there could be agreement on some elements. \u201cLet\u2019s work together, let\u2019s find some of the things in his plan that we agree with and let\u2019s go ahead and do that for the American people,\u201d he told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d The past week was an indication that \u201cwe can come together,\u201d Cantor told \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d citing the passage of three trade bills. Cantor did not make clear exactly where areas of agreement may be.  But he cited the need to help small businesses find capital, unemployment insurance reform, and infrastructure spending as broad ideas for which both sides have expressed support. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be for tax increases on small businesses,\u201d he said of the president\u2019s plan. Republicans filibustered the Senate version of the jobs bill last week, though a handful of Democrats had said they would have opposed the measure if it had made it to the chamber\u2019s floor. Speaking to a conference in Las Vegas on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urged the GOP to \u201cget off of this kick of saying that the only thing that will create jobs is to lower taxes.\u201d Among other things, Obama\u2019s overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. The largest measure in the package is the payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion. Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December.  Obama wants to cut the tax in half, to 3.1%. Republicans previously embraced the cut, but have increasingly questioned its economic merit. A second key measure \u2013 estimated to cost roughly $44 billion \u2013 is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed. Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times. Republicans are at particularly sharp odds with Democrats over how to pay for the plan. GOP leaders oppose a provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million. Republicans have accused the president of engaging in so-called \u201cclass warfare,\u201d while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility. On Monday, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that Democrats will seek a 0.5% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million to pay for the first individual component of Obama\u2019s broader jobs package. That component of the larger jobs bill would provide $35 billion in aid to states to help preserve jobs for teachers and first responders, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s office said. However, a top Senate Republican leadership aide immediately said that Republicans \u2013 and some Democrats \u2013 probably would not be willing to go along with a tax increase to pay for the measure.

Bush beat expectations by winning Iowa in 1980, helping to earn a spot on Reagan's ticket Mitt Romney is trying to keep expectations low in Iowa -- never easy for a front runner As you\u2019re being inundated with wall-to-wall coverage of the Iowa caucuses this week, keep the following number in mind: zero. The quest for the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination is ultimately a race for delegates.  With 2,286 delegates attending the party\u2019s national convention in Tampa at the end of August, the backing of slightly over half of that group \u2013 1,144 \u2013 will be needed for Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, or someone else to capture the prize. Guess how many of these delegates will be selected in Iowa on January 3.  Zero.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada. Iowa matters for one reason only: the media says so.  It\u2019s been deemed the first \u201creal\u201d contest on the presidential nominating calendar, and for some reason \u201cfirst\u201d warrants wall-to-wall coverage.  The winner \u2013 or perceived winner \u2013 is almost certain to get a campaign cash boost and ride a tidal wave of media-fueled momentum. \u201cBig Mo,\u201d as George H.W. Bush once famously called it, can be a game changer. Iowa: Anyone's race to win Iowa caucuses ad wars heat up Betting on candidates Want to know what really happens in Iowa in January?  Not much.  A few thousand people who care enough about politics to spend an evening at their local library or church basement will decide who gets to attend the state GOP\u2019s county conventions in March. They\u2019ll also participate in a non-binding presidential preference vote.  (\u201cNon-binding\u201d means the state\u2019s national convention delegates do not have to vote according to the preferences of caucus participants.) And that\u2019s about it. In March, the county convention delegates will decide who attends a bunch of congressional district meetings and a statewide convention in late April and June.  That\u2019s when most of Iowa\u2019s 28 national convention delegates \u2014 a bit over 1% of the total number of delegates in Tampa \u2014 will actually be chosen.  If there\u2019s already a likely nominee by that point, you can bet Iowa won\u2019t rock the boat. Remember Mike Huckabee\u2019s big win in the 2008 Iowa GOP caucuses?  The party\u2019s eventual nominee, John McCain, won all of Iowa\u2019s delegate votes at the national convention. The history of the Iowa caucuses is actually a case study in the power of the media to shape \u2013 or warp, depending on your point of view \u2013 the nomination contest. \u201cThe name of the presidential nominating game is perception, and the reality of the Iowa precinct caucuses has long been replaced by the media perception,\u201d writes Drake University Professor Hugh Winebrenner.  \u201cIt is not the caucus event per se but the media report of the event that shapes the presidential selection process.\u201d The Democrats, who stripped most nominating power from their party bosses after 1968, first realized Iowa\u2019s power in 1972 when the press all but declared George McGovern the \u201cwinner\u201d after his surprise second-place finish behind establishment favorite Ed Muskie.  McGovern, a liberal anti-Vietnam War candidate, went on to win the nomination. Four years later, a little known former Georgia governor rocketed onto the national stage by finishing second in Iowa behind an uncommitted delegate slate.  Jimmy Carter eventually rolled all the way to the White House. CNN.com: GOP presidential field still unsettled In 1980, Iowa Republicans came up with the idea of a non-binding preference vote as a way to provide more concrete results to a media mob hungry for primary-style hard numbers to report.  The elder Bush\u2019s upset win over Ronald Reagan rattled the GOP race that year and eventually helped earn Bush the vice presidential slot. In 1984, Gary Hart\u2019s second-place Iowa finish beat expectations, set him up for a victory in New Hampshire, and established him as the main alternative to Walter Mondale.  It also winnowed the field, effectively eliminating John Glenn after Glenn finished a disappointing fifth. CNN.com: Did Gingrich push Medicare drug bill In 2004, eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry jumped from third to first place in the national polls following his Iowa victory.  John Edwards also surprised pundits with a strong second-place showing.  Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt crippled each other with a barrage of negative ads. Dean became best remembered for his infamous election night \u201cscream,\u201d which further damaged his insurgent campaign. Four years ago, Barack Obama\u2019s eight-point win in Iowa established him as a force to be reckoned with on the Democratic side.  Hillary Clinton\u2019s disappointing third place finish, meanwhile, undercut her early knockout strategy and set in motion a long nomination fight that her establishment campaign was ill-prepared to fight. On the Republican side, McCain proved it\u2019s possible to ignore Iowa and live to fight another day.  The senator\u2019s campaign set the media expectations bar low by making it clear he was focusing most of his attention on New Hampshire.  McCain\u2019s fourth place finish in Iowa proved to be irrelevant when he rolled to victory in the Granite State. This time around, Mitt Romney\u2019s camp has tried to keep media expectations low in Iowa \u2013 never an easy trick when you\u2019re seen as the national frontrunner and are therefore expected to compete everywhere.  A first-place Iowa finish for the former Massachusetts governor \u2013 overcoming regional, religious, and ideological obstacles \u2013 could set Romney up for a huge win the following week in neighboring New Hampshire.  It could also signal an early end to the nomination fight. Conversely, if Newt Gingrich hangs on for a first-place win in Iowa, the former speaker could potentially narrow Romney\u2019s lead in New Hampshire and set the stage for a more protracted contest.  Or maybe Rick Santorum\u2019s investment in Iowa will reap a reward from the state\u2019s social conservatives and earn the former Pennsylvania senator another look from activists in other parts of the country. Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is a first-place finish by Ron Paul, a candidate with unorthodox GOP views on economic, defense, and social issues.  A victory for the Texas congressman \u2013 who has a strong Iowa organization in place \u2013 would test the assumption that there\u2019s a hard ceiling on his popular support.  It could also help Romney by denying other candidates more favorable media attention. Defenders of Iowa\u2019s role in the nomination process fear a Paul win could potentially marginalize the state in the future by associating it with non-mainstream attitudes. Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Terry Branstad, is already trying to finesse the significance of a Paul victory. \u201cIt\u2019s who comes in second and who comes in third as well as who comes in first,\u201d Branstad recently told CNN.  \u201cAnd if somebody else does surprisingly well, it could well launch their campaign.  It\u2019s happened before.  So you don\u2019t necessarily have to win in Iowa, but you do need to be in the top three to be in contention going forward.\u201d Just remember: no matter who finishes first, second, or third in Iowa, nobody will be any closer to the magic 1,144 delegate mark at the end of the night.  The January 3 caucuses are a media expectations game, the importance of which depends entirely on voter reactions to the headlines on January 4.

            "article_content": "NEW: Veteran Sen. McCain says the dispute is hurting Republicans President Obama calls on House leaders to hold a direct vote on the Senate plan Speaker Boehner asks Obama to call back the Senate Sen. Reid says Senate Democrats won't agree to House GOP demands to restart talks The congressional impasse over extending the payroll tax cut became a showdown Tuesday between President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. After the Republican-controlled House passed a measure calling for more negotiations, Boehner made public a letter to Obama that urged him to order the Senate back from its holiday break to take part in further talks. Leaders in the Democratic-controlled Senate reject that idea, and Obama agreed with them, telling reporters in a previously unscheduled appearance that the House must approve a two-month extension passed by an 89-10 vote in the Senate. \u201cThe bipartisan compromise that was reached on Saturday is the only viable way to prevent a tax hike on January 1,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one.\u201d The House motion, passed Tuesday with no Democratic support on a 229-193 vote, expressed the chamber\u2019s disagreement with the Senate plan and called for the dispute to be immediately taken up by a House-Senate conference committee \u2013 something already ruled out by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. However, Boehner and the Republican leadership prevented a direct vote on the Senate\u2019s two-month extension, signaling they may lack enough GOP support to defeat it in the face of unrelenting pressure from the White House, Democrats and some Senate Republicans. Obama calls House to vote on extension 'Tea party tail is wagging the elephant' Boehner: 'I need the president to help' Vote on payroll tax bill delayed Cantor: No vote on the payroll tax Instead, the House approved a separate resolution supporting a yearlong extension of both the payroll tax cut and emergency federal unemployment benefits. House Republicans are also pushing for a new, two-year \u201cdoc fix,\u201d or delay in significant scheduled pay cuts to Medicare physicians. All three measures are set to expire December 31. iReport: What could you do with $40? Meanwhile, House members headed out of town for their holiday break after legislative business ended Tuesday. The Senate measure approved Saturday called for a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, unemployment benefits and the \u201cdoc fix\u201d spending. It was a fallback plan designed to give both sides more time to negotiate. Now that short-term compromise has slammed into a conservative roadblock in the House, where rank-and-file Republicans are fuming over the two-month time period of the plan, among other things. The lingering dispute is hurting his party, veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told CNN, adding that the reality of the issue is that the payroll tax cut must be extended to help out Americans still struggling in the economic recovery. \u201cIt is harming the Republican Party,\u201d McCain said. \u201cIt is harming the view, if it\u2019s possible any more, of the American people about Congress.\u201d As the clock ticks down, nobody appears willing to bend and neither side seems to know how to break the logjam. Boehner, R-Ohio, appointed House GOP negotiators for a conference committee, but Democrats say they have no plans to do the same. According to House Republican sources, their strategy is to generate as much news coverage as possible of their appointed conferees in coming days to keep the pressure on Democrats to negotiate. \u201cWe are going to try to remind people that we are still in town ready to work,\u201d said one House GOP leadership aide. One of the House negotiators, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, told CNN that he has already notified his wife that he will be in Washington for Christmas. Boehner called for Obama to order the Senate to return from its holiday recess and appoint negotiators. The House already has come back from its holiday break to respond to the Senate\u2019s two-month proposal. In a letter to Obama made public by  Boehner\u2019s office, the speaker said, \u201cI ask you to call on the Senate to return to appoint negotiators so that we can provide the American people the economic certainty they need.\u201d \u201cWho doesn\u2019t believe that if we don\u2019t do this now that when we get to February 28th, guess where we\u2019ll be?  We\u2019ll be right here doing the same thing that we are doing right now. I just think the American people expect us to do our work,\u201d Boehner said during debate on the House floor. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the House needs to pass the Senate two-month extension so that a full one-year extension can be worked out. \u201cIn order for it to get done, it has to pass the House,\u201d Carney said, adding that Obama \u201ccannot order the extension of the payroll tax cut. Congress has to take action.\u201d Obama then made his surprise appearance in the White House briefing room and called for Boehner to allow an up-or-down vote on the Senate proposal. \u201cHouse Republicans refuse to allow a vote,\u201d Obama said, noting that Senate leaders from both parties had agreed to the short-term extension in order to guarantee that taxes don\u2019t increase for working Americans while negotiations continue early next year on the one-year extension that House Republicans say they support. \u201cWhat they\u2019re really holding out for is to wring concessions from Democrats on issues that have nothing to do with the payroll tax cut,\u201d Obama said of House Republicans. Neither Reid nor House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, would appoint Democratic negotiators for the conference committee proposed by House Republicans. Boehner named eight House Republicans as his representatives, but there was no word on Senate Republican conferees. The mistrust between the parties was palpable. When asked if Democrats were to blame for the impasse by refusing to name conference committee negotiators, Pelosi said the issue was the refusal by House Republicans to go along with the bipartisan support for the Senate plan. \u201cWhatever they say is irrelevant,\u201d Pelosi declared about Republican claims of wanting a one-year payroll tax cut extension. \u201cWhat they do is what\u2019s important, and what they\u2019re doing is not giving a payroll tax cut to 160 million Americans.\u201d House Republicans, meanwhile, repeatedly suggested the 60-day extension in the Senate plan would be the limit of action on the issue if it passed, rejecting insistence by Obama and Reid that they wanted to continue working for a longer deal during the first two months of 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re going to drag them kicking and screaming to a conference,\u201d said Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland. A failure to act could have major economic and political fallout. The payroll tax break alone is worth roughly $1,000 a year for an average family and affects about 160 million Americans. Numerous observers believe Obama is preparing to parrot Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 campaign next year by running against an unpopular, dysfunctional Congress controlled partly by the GOP. \u201cThis effort is more toward securing votes than toward securing economic growth,\u201d said conservative Republican Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona. The House GOP leaders\u2019 decision not to hold a direct up-or-down vote on the $33 billion Senate plan \u2013 an apparent reversal of earlier plans \u2013 came after a two-hour meeting of the entire House Republican caucus late Monday. Pelosi told reporters that the change probably meant that Boehner and his lieutenants lacked enough support from their own members to guarantee a defeat for the Senate bill. In the 434-member House chamber \u2013 one seat is currently vacant \u2013 the 242-seat Republican majority can only afford 26 defections to overcome a unified 192-seat Democratic minority. A House GOP leadership aide conceded to CNN that it is a \u201ccleaner message\u201d to simply vote to affirm the House position on extending the payroll tax cut for a year, instead of opposing a two-month extension. \u201cWe outright reject the attempt by the Senate to kick the can down for 60 days,\u201d Cantor said after Monday night\u2019s caucus meeting. Carney emphasized that the bipartisan support in the Senate showed it was House Republicans in the minority on the issue, with the White House, Democrats and Senate Republicans all calling for the two-month extension. Democratic legislators, meanwhile, said it was Republicans blocking progress in Congress. Senate Republicans objected to a floor vote on the House GOP payroll tax plan, while House Republicans now have prevented an up-or-down vote on the Senate measure that had broad GOP support, they said. Boehner, however, said Monday night that \u201cwe disagreed with what the Senate produced.\u201d \u201cThey did their job,\u201d he said of his call last week for the Senate to send the House a proposal. \u201cThey produced a bill, and the House disagreed with it.\u201d While there are sharp differences over how to proceed, both the House and Senate versions of the legislation extend the tax cut, unemployment benefits and the doc fix.  Both measures also would push for presidential action on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 something demanded by Republicans. Meanwhile, five mostly moderate Republican senators have called for the House to support the Senate\u2019s two-month extension. The group consists of Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. Brown issued a statement after Tuesday\u2019s House vote that said House Republicans \u201cwould rather continue playing politics than find solutions.\u201d \u201cTheir actions will hurt American families and be detrimental to our fragile economy,\u201d said Brown, who is facing a stiff re-election challenge in heavily Democratic Massachusetts next year. \u201cWe are Americans first; now is not the time for drawing lines in the sand.\u201d Meanwhile, five Democratic senators called on House Republicans to pass the Senate plan in order to speed up approval of the Keystone pipeline. Boehner appears to have reversed himself since a conference call with caucus members Saturday, when he was the only House Republican leader to express support for the Senate plan, according to a GOP source. The source said Boehner described the Senate vote as \u201ca good deal\u201d and \u201ca victory\u201d in the conference call. For his part, the speaker insisted Tuesday that he raised concerns about the Senate plan when he first heard of it. \u201cThe rank-and-file members are extremely opposed\u201d to the Senate plan, a GOP source stressed, adding that most members were concerned about the uncertainty caused by just a two-month extension, as well as the political benefit the White House could gain in the national dialogue over taxes. The Senate\u2019s two-month measure would reduce the deficit by nearly $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Under the plan, the $33 billion in costs would be offset by an increase in the fees that new homeowners with federally backed mortgages would pay to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration. Those entities would then turn that money over to the U.S. Treasury. The bump would amount to about $15 per month for every $200,000 borrowed, Senate aides estimated. Most senators agreed on a two-month extension as a fallback position after Democrats and Republicans were unable to reach a more long-term, comprehensive agreement.

The Senate voted 89-10 in favor of a two-month extension on Saturday, but that short-term compromise has slammed into a conservative roadblock in the House, where rank-and-file Republicans are fuming over the short-term nature of the plan, among other things. A Republican-led congressional panel on Monday night rejected a Democratic motion to allow a full House vote on the Senate plan \u2013 a move top Democrats characterized as a sign of weakness on the part of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other House GOP leaders. The House is instead expected to hold votes Tuesday on a measure calling for the issue to be taken up by a House-Senate conference committee, as well as on a resolution supporting a year-long extension of both the payroll tax cut and emergency federal unemployment benefits.

In the 434-member House chamber \u2013 one seat is currently vacant \u2013 the 242-seat Republican majority can only afford 26 defections to overcome a unified 192-seat Democratic minority. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, part of the House Democratic leadership, said Monday night his party\u2019s caucus was 99% in support of the Senate measure. A House GOP leadership aide conceded to CNN that it is a \u201ccleaner message\u201d to simply vote to affirm the House position on extending the payroll tax cut  for a year, instead of opposing a two-month extension. Another GOP aide said Republicans now believe it makes more sense for them to have an \u201caffirmative vote\u201d instead of a \u201cnegative one.\u201d Earlier, House GOP leaders announced that votes on the issue would take place Tuesday instead of Monday night, as originally planned. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California, told reporters that it was better to hold the votes \u201cnot in the dark of night but in the light of day.\u201d The political drama followed a day of escalating brinksmanship as legislators stepped up their game of chicken over the expiring payroll tax cut. Democrats flatly rejected Boehner\u2019s demand to ditch the two-month extension passed by the Senate last week in favor of an immediate one-year continuation.  Boehner and other GOP leaders argue that the two-month proposal amounts to a short-term fix instead of resolving the issue to provide certainty to American taxpayers and businesses. \u201cWe outright reject the attempt by the Senate to kick the can down for 60 days,\u201d Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said after Monday night\u2019s caucus meeting. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has said he has no intention of considering the new GOP plan.   On Monday, he blasted Boehner for allegedly abandoning the Senate compromise. \u201cI negotiated a compromise (with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky) at Speaker Boehner\u2019s request.  I will not reopen negotiations until the House follows through and passes this agreement that was negotiated by Republican leaders and supported by 90 percent of the Senate,\u201d Reid said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called Boehner\u2019s stance \u201cnonsensical,\u201d stating that it \u201ctakes compromise to get something done\u201d under divided government. \u201cAmericans paying attention to this must be pulling their hair out,\u201d Carney said. Boehner, however, said Monday night that \u201cwe disagreed with what the Senate produced.\u201d \u201cThey did their job,\u201d he said of his call last week for the Senate to send the House a proposal. \u201cThey produced a bill, and the House disagreed with it.\u201d While there are sharp differences over how to proceed, both the House and Senate versions of the legislation extend the tax cut, unemployment benefits and the doc fix.  Both measures also would push for presidential action on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 something demanded by Republicans. Among the obstacles facing a possible conference committee to hash out the differences: the Senate has already adjourned for the year and is on its holiday break.  Also, Pelosi has said she has no intention of appointing members to a conference committee without getting an opportunity for a direct vote on the Senate proposal. Both Pelosi and Reid have said such negotiations should happen when Congress returns from its holiday recess in January, after the Senate\u2019s two-month payroll tax-cut extension has passed. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Monday that  the maneuvers by House Republicans show they never supported a payroll tax decrease in the first place. On Monday, at least five mostly moderate Republican senators voiced disapproval with the possible defeat of the Senate plan, demonstrating increasing pressure on House Republicans to pass it. The group included Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and Nevada Sen. Dean Heller. \u201cDuring this time of divided government, both parties need to be reasonable and come to the negotiating table in good faith,\u201d said Brown, who is facing a stiff re-election challenge in heavily Democratic Massachusetts next year.  \u201cWe cannot allow rigid partisan ideology and unwillingness to compromise stand in the way of working together for the good of the American people.\u201d Meanwhile, five Democratic senators called on House Republicans to pass the Senate plan in order to speed up approval of the Keystone pipeline. Congressional Democratic leaders insist the Republican-led House will be blamed for a year-end increase in working Americans\u2019 tax bills if it fails to go along with the Senate. \u201cThis is a pass-the-popcorn moment for Democrats,\u201d one senior congressional Democratic leadership aide told CNN Monday. \u201cBoehner has been hung out to dry by his caucus, and we are not going to save him.\u201d CNNMoney: What happens if payroll tax cut is not extended? Boehner apparently reversed himself since a conference call with caucus members Saturday, when he was the only House Republican leader to express support for the Senate plan, according to a GOP source. The source said Boehner described the Senate vote as \u201ca good deal\u201d and \u201ca victory\u201d in the conference call, and that Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole and North Carolina Rep.

            "article_content": "The bill goes to President Obama for his signature The almost $1 trillion spending plan keeps the government funded through September Senate also approves a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut The Senate on Saturday approved a compromise spending bill to keep the government funded for the rest of the fiscal year \u2013 a day after the bill won approval from the House of Representatives. The bill now heads to President Barack Obama for his signature. Obama signed a continuing resolution passed by the House to keep the government funded through next week while the bill\u2019s details are finalized. The almost $1 trillion measure passed on a 296-121 vote in the House on Friday, before heading to the Senate where it passed 67-32\u2013 averting a partial government shutdown as a deadline loomed at midnight Friday. A one-day continuing resolution was passed by the Senate on Friday and signed by Obama to keep the government funded through Saturday\u2019s vote. Senators on Saturday also voted to extend the payroll tax cut by two months, after both sides were unable to reach a comprehensive agreement to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for a full year. Thune: We'll be back 'in two months' Sen. Barrasso: 'It's a good deal' Sen. Hatch: We're not going to give in White House happy with payroll tax talks The two major pieces of legislation were linked this week in political maneuvering involving the White House and Senate leaders. Congressional negotiators signed off on the government appropriations plan Thursday night. The giant spending package appropriates money for the rest of fiscal year 2012, which ends September 30, at levels agreed to in the debt-ceiling agreement in August. Obama and Democrats have pushed for the separate measure that would prevent the payroll tax cut enacted last year from expiring at the end of this month. A Democratic effort to delay action on the spending plan \u2013 which was agreed to by a bipartisan conference committee \u2013 until resolution of the payroll tax cut issue fell apart in talks between party leaders that began Wednesday night. With House approval of the spending plan, the onus of legislative action fell on the Senate, where a deep partisan divide had stalled progress on the payroll tax-cut measure until negotiations began in earnest Thursday. The Senate talks involve extending the payroll tax cut and other provisions that expire at the end of the year, including an extension of unemployment benefits and an increase in payments to doctors who provide Medicare services. Democrats want these programs to be extended through 2012, but they had floated the idea of a fallback two-month extension to ensure there will be no negative impact on Americans if Congress fails to reach a broader deal. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the two-month extension would clear the way for further negotiations on a larger deal. But House Speaker John Boehner said Friday that any attempt for a short-term extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits would get altered in the House, in particular by adding a controversial provision to speed government approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. According to congressional sources, and confirmed by Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the two-month plan proposed by Senate negotiators Friday night included the oil pipeline provision. It also would extend the lower payroll tax rate, unemployment benefits and the increased payments to Medicare doctors. The Obama administration has delayed until 2013 a decision on the pipeline that would transport oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands production facilities in northern Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. Obama: No payroll tax cut, no vacation The delay followed complaints by environmentalists and Nebraska officials that the pipeline route could threaten that state\u2019s Sandhills region and vital Ogallala aquifer. Alternate routes are being considered, and Nebraska officials as well as the pipeline company, TransCanada, acknowledge that the process of approving a final route will last into the second half of 2012. Republicans, who traditionally back the oil industry, accuse Obama of delaying the issue until after his re-election bid next year for political reasons. In the House, they added the provision to require a decision on the Keystone project within 60 days, arguing it would create jobs and reduce U.S. dependency on oil from the Middle East. The House version lacked Senate support and never came up for a vote. The State Department, which has final authority to approve the oil pipeline, warned that the shortened deadline for a decision on the pipeline would effectively kill the project because there would be insufficient time to assess the route alteration. The legislative maneuvering was a last-gasp bid to end weeks of political wrangling that threatened a partial government shutdown and raised public frustration with Congress even further. A poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed public discontent with Congress at record levels, with two-thirds of voters saying most lawmakers should be voted out of office next year.

            "article_content": "The appropriations measure goes to the Senate, which also is expected to pass it The nearly $1 trillion spending plan keeps the government funded through September Senate negotiators propose a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut A compromise spending bill to keep the government funded for the rest of the fiscal year won approval Friday from the House of Representatives, the first step toward averting a partial government shutdown at midnight. The nearly $1 trillion measure passed on a 296-121 vote and now goes to the Senate, where approval is also expected. A Senate vote is likely on Saturday, and Senate leaders said the presumption of the measure\u2019s approval will prevent a partial government shutdown when current authorization for government funding ends at midnight Friday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said that under a White House ruling, \u201cif one house passes a spending bill \u2026. and there\u2019s a presumption it will pass in the other body, the time is extended for 24 hours.\u201d \u201cSo everyone doesn\u2019t have to worry about the government closing tonight,\u201d Reid said. White House happy with payroll tax talks Obama: No payroll tax cut, no vacation Pelosi: GOP bill 'seeds of destruction' Explain it to me: Payroll tax cuts A one-day continuing resolution was passed by the Senate Friday and signed by President Barack Obama to keep the government funded through Saturday\u2019s expected vote. Meanwhile, the House headed out for its holiday recess as scheduled after passing the appropriations bill, but Speaker John Boehner told reporters that members could be called back to Washington if the Senate passes a separate measure extending the payroll tax cut. \u201cThe members will go home and if there\u2019s a need to come back to finish our work, we will do so,\u201d said Boehner, R-Ohio. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, notified members they would get 24-hours notice of any pending votes if the Senate sends back a payroll tax-cut measure. On Friday night, Senate negotiators were unable to reach agreement on a comprehensive payroll tax-cut plan and instead proposed a two-month extension. It was unclear if the plan would get eventual approval from the full Senate. Obama has called for Congress to stay in session until both the spending bill and the payroll tax-cut measure have passed. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Obama didn\u2019t want to risk American workers facing a higher payroll tax rate in January on the promise that legislators will return from vacation to pass the payroll tax-cut plan by year-end. The two major pieces of legislation became linked this week in political maneuvering involving the White House and Senate leaders. Congressional negotiators signed off on the government appropriations plan Thursday night. The giant spending package appropriates money for the rest of fiscal 2012, which ends September 30, at levels agreed to in the debt-ceiling agreement in August. Without the spending bill, authorized government funding would end at midnight Friday, causing a partial shutdown. At the same time, Obama and Democrats have pushed for the separate measure that would prevent the payroll tax cut enacted last year from expiring at the end of this month. A Democratic effort to delay action on the spending plan \u2013 which was agreed to by a bipartisan conference committee \u2013 until resolution of the payroll tax cut issue fell apart in talks between party leaders that began Wednesday night. \u201cWe forced them to go ahead and sign the conference report and get that done so that the government doesn\u2019t shut down, and we feel victorious on that,\u201d Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia, said Friday. With House approval of the spending plan, the onus of legislative action fell on the Senate, where a deep partisan divide had stalled progress on the payroll tax-cut measure until negotiations began in earnest Thursday. The Senate talks involve extending the payroll tax cut and other provisions that expire at year-end, including an extension of unemployment benefits and an increase in payments to doctors who provide Medicare services. Democrats want these programs to be extended through 2012 , but they are weighing the idea of a fallback two-month extension to ensure there will be no  negative impact on Americans if Congress fails to reach a broader deal. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the two-month extension \u201cclears the way for negotiations to continue on a larger deal.\u201d However, Boehner said Friday that any attempt for a short-term extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits would be altered in the House, in particular by adding a controversial provision to speed government approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. According to congressional sources, and confirmed by Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the two-month plan proposed by Senate negotiators Friday night included the oil pipeline provision. It also would extend the lower payroll tax rate, unemployment benefits and the increased payments to Medicare doctors. The Obama administration has delayed until 2013 a decision on the pipeline that would transport oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands production facilities in northern Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The delay followed complaints by environmentalists and Nebraska officials that the pipeline route could threaten that state\u2019s Sandhills region and vital Ogallala aquifer.

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. John Thune says a vote could take place Saturday The plan's chances are uncertain in the Senate and House Impasse over how to pay for the measure prevents a broader deal Both parties are holding Senate caucus meetings to go over the two-month proposal Senate negotiators were unable to work out a comprehensive deal on extending the payroll tax cut and instead are proposing a two-month extension, two sources said Friday. The possible deal was being discussed with the caucuses of both parties in separate meetings Friday evening. To move forward, it would have to be approved by the full Senate in a vote that could come as soon as Saturday, and then voted on by the House. According to a top Senate Republican source and a Democratic source, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for a full year. Instead, they are proposing a plan to extend those programs \u2013 and increased Medicare payments to doctors \u2013 at current levels for two months. The impasse involved how to pay for the programs for a full year, the sources said. However, the two-month extension would be fully paid for, according to the sources. Carney: 'Pure politics' game with tax Pelosi: GOP bill 'seeds of destruction' Obama: No payroll tax cut, no vacation Explain it to me: Payroll tax cuts Payroll tax cut: What\u2019s at stake? In addition, the Republican source said that the GOP side also got Democrats to agree to include a provision to speed up a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline as part of the deal. It was unclear whether the full Senate would accept the two-month plan. Even less certain was whether the proposal would be supported by either party in the House. Democrats, led by President Barack Obama, made extending the payroll tax cut a major priority, and a two-month agreement could be a disappointment. Conservative House Republicans, meanwhile, oppose such short-term steps in their push for substantive spending reforms. \u201cWe have not signed off on anything, and we will not until we talk to our members,\u201d a House Republican leadership aide said. Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota confirmed the details of the proposal in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect solution by any stretch, but it\u2019s what we were able to get through.\u201d A Senate vote would take place Saturday \u201cif everything moves forward according to plan,\u201d Thune told Burnett. The scaled-back proposal followed a day of negotiations as legislators tried to wrap up their work on what was scheduled to be the final day before breaking for their holiday recess. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Democrats supported the two-month deal because \u201cthat was the best we could get\u201d and it was important to preserve the payroll tax break, even temporarily. Failure to pass the payroll tax measure, a major part of Obama\u2019s job-creation plan, would cost working Americans an average of $1,000 in higher taxes next year. The White House issued a statement after news of the two-month proposal broke Friday, lauding the agreement despite the inclusion of the pipeline provision \u2013 something the president has said he would reject. \u201cThis is an important step towards enacting a key provision of the president\u2019s American Jobs Act and a significant victory for the American people and the economy, because as independent analysts have said, failing to extend this tax cut would have had a damaging effect on our recovery and job growth,\u201d said the statement issued by White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer. \u201cThe president urges Congress now to finish up their business for the American people.\u201d A senior administration noted that though the president has said he would reject any attempt to \u201cmandate\u201d construction of the pipeline before it receives further review, the Keystone provision Senate leaders have agreed to speeds up the approval process \u2013 giving the administration 60 days to make a decision \u2013 but does not mandate construction. When asked about the apparent contradiction by the president over the pipeline provision, another senior administration official said the president\u2019s top priority is making sure taxes don\u2019t go up January 1. In the Senate, the payroll tax measure has faced an impasse over specific provisions sought by each party. Senate Democrats proposed a new tax on income of more than $1 million to help pay for the lower payroll tax rate for another year, but Republicans have blocked the plan from proceeding on two occasions. Meanwhile, House Republicans pushed through their own version of a payroll tax measure this week that included a provision to speed government approval of the Keystone pipeline. The Obama administration has delayed until 2013 a decision on the pipeline that would transport oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands production facilities in northern Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The delay followed complaints by environmentalists and Nebraska officials that the pipeline route could threaten that state\u2019s Sandhills region and vital Ogallala aquifer. Alternate routes are being considered, and Nebraska officials as well as the pipeline company, TransCanada, acknowledge that the process of approving a final route will last into the second half of 2012. Republicans, who traditionally back the oil industry, accuse Obama of delaying the issue until after his re-election bid next year for political reasons. Labor unions that usually support Democrats back the pipeline project, while environmentalists also allied with the political left oppose it. The House plan that includes the oil pipeline provision never came up for a vote in the Senate, leading to the negotiations in what were scheduled to be the final days of congressional action this year. Democrats wanted the lower payroll tax rate and other provisions extended through 2012, but were weighing the idea of a fallback two-month extension to ensure that there will be no negative impact on Americans if Congress fails to reach a broader deal this week. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the two-month extension would set up further negotiations on a larger deal. However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Friday that any attempt for a short-term extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits would be altered in the House. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also said he would need the provision to speed up a decision on the pipeline in order to support a payroll tax-cut extension. The two-month plan proposed by Senate negotiators Friday night included the oil pipeline provision in what Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, called a \u201cmeaningless concession\u201d since Obama ultimately retains the ability to reject the project. The State Department, which has final authority to approve the oil pipeline, has warned that a shortened deadline for approving the project would leave insufficient time to assess the route alteration. The legislative maneuvering was a last-gasp bid to end weeks of political wrangling that threatened a partial government shutdown and raised public frustration with Congress even further.

            "article_content": "NEW: Another conservative Republican also says a payroll tax cut deal will happen Sen. McConnell: A GOP plan linking the issue to an oil pipeline project has bipartisan support President Obama and the top Senate Democrat reject the Republican proposal Workers face higher taxes if the lower payroll tax rate isn't extended by the end of the year Republicans demanding specific ideological provisions as part of a deal to extend the payroll tax cut appear to be going against their party\u2019s anti-tax orthodoxy, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. The comments demonstrated the GOP shift on a proposal originally opposed by Republican leaders, even as each side continues trying to persuade the other of the best legislative approach to take. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d the House Republican plan could get bipartisan support in both chambers. But South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he doubted a final bill would include the Keystone provision. President Barack Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid have rejected the House plan, but McConnell, R-Kentucky, said enough Senate Democrats support it to get it passed if a vote is held. Asked if Americans will wake up January 1 to a tax increase because Congress failed to act on the issue, McConnell responded: \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen, and obviously we\u2019ll reach an agreement.\u201d Later in the interview, McConnell declared that extending the payroll tax cut \u201chas bipartisan support.\u201d Another conservative Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, agreed that a compromise would emerge but said he doubted it would include the oil pipeline provision. More on the pipeline showdown Boehner touts job creation, tax relief Obama urges payroll tax cut extension Pelosi: GOP extremists stalling tax cut Explain it to me: Payroll tax cuts \u201cAt the end of the day the payroll tax will get extended as it is now,\u201d Graham said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding: \u201cThe pipeline\u2019s probably not going to sell.\u201d Democrats led by Obama have been pushing for the payroll tax cut extension, with Republicans initially opposing the plan but now signing on. However, the parties are at loggerheads over how to pay for it as well as the political optics over who should get credit, as an election year approaches. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest priority of the president and the Democrats in Congress,\u201d liberal Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told NBC. The House GOP proposal would both change the process and shorten the time frame for the government to approve the proposed pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands production in northern Alberta to Texas. The State Department recently said its decision would be delayed until 2013 to examine environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political to put off the issue until after next year\u2019s presidential election. Obama said last week that he will reject any effort to link the oil pipeline to extending the payroll tax cut, which will maintain $1,000 in tax savings for American workers. \u201cNow is not the time to be debating unrelated measures like an oil pipeline,\u201d Reid said in a statement Friday. \u201cIf the House sends us their bill with Keystone in it, they are just wasting valuable time because it will not pass the Senate.\u201d The impasse sets up another countdown clock on congressional action, this time before the end-of-year holiday recess scheduled to begin at the end of next week. The House GOP measure extends the payroll tax cut for one year and renews aid for the unemployed, while cutting back the maximum length of jobless benefits from the current 99 weeks to 59. The bill also allows states more flexibility in distributing unemployment assistance, permitting states to require those applying to submit to drug tests or show they are pursuing a high school degree if they don\u2019t have one. The bill would also avoid a scheduled cut in pay for Medicare physicians for two years, a provision known as the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d As a way to garner support from reluctant conservative Republicans, who voiced concerns about the impact of the payroll tax cut on Social Security, GOP leaders insisted on keeping the provision aimed at moving toward approving the pipeline project within 60 days. The House is expected to vote on the Republican bill Tuesday. In the meantime, Senate Democrats have begun working on a new bill of their own after Republicans blocked progress on previous proposals that included a surtax on income over $1 million. The pipeline issue is just one part of the problem for Senate Democrats who disagree with \u201ccentral elements\u201d of the GOP bill, including the length of the unemployment insurance extension and the proposed cost offsets, according to one Democratic aide. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California argued Friday that the pipeline provision is \u201ca poison pill designed to sink the payroll tax cut.\u201d The House is expected to vote on the Republican bill Tuesday. In the meantime, Senate Democrats have begun working on a new bill of their own after Republicans blocked progress on previous proposals that included a surtax on income over $1 million. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to pay for it in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d Graham said on NBC, adding that the \u201cidea of taxing one group to pay for a tax cut for another is not going to sell.\u201d Durbin complained that Republicans \u201chave consistently said they will refuse to increase the taxes on the wealthiest people in America one penny, if that\u2019s what it takes to make sure that working families get a payroll tax cut.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Senate Democratic leader rejects planned House proposal Separate Democratic and Republican proposals are blocked in the Senate Raising taxes remains an unresolved issue dividing Democrats and Republicans House GOP proposal links payroll tax cut to an oil pipeline project, defying Obama Setting up a showdown with the White House and Senate Democrats, House Republican leaders Thursday proceeded with plans to vote next week on a proposal to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while easing the path for approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Meanwhile, the Senate blocked competing Democratic and Republican proposals to extend the payroll tax cut from proceeding Thursday, with both failing to get the 60 votes necessary. Senate Republicans halted the Democratic proposal on a 50-48 vote. It included a surtax on income over $1 million to help pay for the lower payroll tax rate. Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose such a tax increase. Opposition from both parties blocked the Republican measure, with only 22 votes in favor and 76 against it. The measure would have been paid for by freezing federal pay as well as reducing the federal work force by 10%, provisions rejected by President Barack Obama and Democrats. The outcome means party leaders and Obama must work out a compromise by the end of the year, when the payroll tax cut is set to expire, or face the wrath of Americans facing higher taxes in the election year of 2012. On the House side, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told a closed-door meeting of GOP members that he was ready for a \u201cfight\u201d with Obama over the pipeline issue, according to two senior Republican leadership aides in the meeting. Cheers went up in the room after Boehner\u2019s comment, the aides said. A bipartisan payroll tax plan? Obama: We're greater together than alone Payroll tax war On Wednesday, Obama said he would reject any attempt by Republicans to tie the pipeline project to the payroll tax extension issue. The House proposal would shift authority from the State Department to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approving the proposed pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands production in northern Alberta to Texas. It also would shorten the time frame for a decision. The State Department recently said its decision would be delayed until 2013 to examine environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political to put off the issue until after next year\u2019s presidential election. Boehner told reporters after Thursday\u2019s meeting that the pipeline project would generate \u201ctens of thousands of jobs immediately.\u201d He also noted that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper supports the plan. The State Department puts the jobs figure at 5,000-6,000, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, slammed the House GOP proposal on Thursday as a \u201cpartisan joke that has no chance of passing the Senate.\u201d The impasse sets up another countdown clock on congressional action, this time before the end-of-year holiday recess scheduled to begin at the end of next week. Obama told reporters Thursday that he was willing to stay in Washington \u201cas long as it takes to make sure that the American people\u2019s taxes don\u2019t go up on January 1st and to make sure that folks who desperately need unemployment insurance get that help.\u201d \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse for us not getting it done,\u201d Obama said, adding that his response to efforts by Republicans \u201cto see what can they extract from us in order to get this done\u201d was \u201cjust do the right thing.\u201d Referring specifically to the Keystone project, Obama said that \u201chowever many jobs might be generated by a Keystone pipeline, there are going to be a lot fewer than the jobs that are created by extending the payroll tax cut and extending unemployment insurance.\u201d The House proposal, which Boehner and other leaders outlined to GOP members at Thursday\u2019s meeting, was largely similar to one they discussed last week, according to several aides. It would extend the payroll tax cut for one year, continuing savings of $1,000 for families earning $50,000. It also includes unemployment assistance but gives states the ability to reform the program \u2013 including removal of a federal ban from the 1960s that prohibited states from drug-testing those who apply for unemployment benefits. The GOP legislation would also shorten the time period for receiving jobless aid benefits from the current level of 99 weeks, phasing it down to 59 weeks by the middle of 2012. In addition, the bill would avoid a scheduled cut in payments for Medicare physicians for two years \u2013 the so-called \u201cdoc fix.\u201d Boehner noted that the bill is \u201cfully paid for,\u201d and aides said the bulk of the cost would be offset from a freeze on salaries of federal employees and members of Congress through 2015. The measure would use funds from health care programs to pay for the Medicare \u201cdoc fix\u201d provision. Last week, GOP leaders encountered significant resistance from conservatives when they outlined their plan, with a bloc of members opposing any renewal of the payroll tax cut because the bill uses spending cuts over 10 years to pay for a one-year extension. Some of those critics later said that after they talked through their concerns with leaders, they don\u2019t want to see a tax increase during the tough economy, even though they don\u2019t support the structure of the payroll tax cut. Republican leaders also added a couple of new spending cuts to help attract conservative support. One would eliminate the child tax credit for those in the country illegally, and another would not renew a research-and-development tax credit focused on energy programs. Some Republicans noted that Obama\u2019s comments the day before opposing any effort to link extending the payroll tax cut to the Keystone pipeline helped rally support for the plan. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, leader of the fiscally conservative Republican Study Group, said he supports the bill, adding: \u201cFrankly, the fact that the president doesn\u2019t like it makes me like it even more.\u201d Asked about overcoming divisions among Republicans, Boehner said feedback on the proposal was good and that \u201cI feel confident about our ability to move ahead.\u201d The House is expected to vote on the bill early next week, according to several aides. Even though the Republican plan could muster a majority of votes in the House, it is likely to encounter major obstacles in the Democratic-led Senate. The issue, a headache for Republicans already, threatens to become a major campaign theme for 2012. Obama touched on it Tuesday in a policy address in Kansas, saying Republicans protected wealthy taxpayers from a tax increase during deficit negotiations this year, but now threaten to block the payroll tax cut extension. Blocking it would cause most Americans to pay higher taxes next year. Republicans, who oppose tax increases in keeping with their push to shrink the size of government, argue that Obama and Democrats are forcing votes on proposals they know won\u2019t pass in order to score political points. So far, the public backs the Democratic position, with polls showing majority support for increasing the tax burden on wealthy Americans to help pay for the measure. Republicans are on the defensive due to their history of arguing that tax cuts end up paying for themselves because they stimulate economic activity by letting consumers keep more of their money instead of giving it to the government. Democrats are quick to point out that the mounting federal deficits dominating the Washington discussion were caused in part by reduced revenue due to tax cuts from the Bush administration. Now both parties agree that any measure to extend the payroll tax cut should include provisions to reduce spending or raise revenue to offset the cost. At issue is the tax on workers that helps fund the Social Security trust fund. As part of a budget-cutting deal last December, Obama and Congress negotiated a reduction of 2 percentage points in the payroll tax rate \u2013 from 6.2% to 4.2%. With the reduced rate expiring on January 1, Obama and Democrats seek to expand the provision by lowering the rate even further \u2013 to 3.1% \u2013 for another year. Republicans initially opposed the idea, saying the provision failed to create jobs last year. Republican leaders now say they support an extension, but they differ with Obama and Democrats on how to pay for it. The latest Democratic plan calls for a 1.9% surtax on income over $1 million, as well as other provisions to cover the $180 billion cost. Republicans oppose the plan because they say it will increase the tax burden on small-business owners, a contention the White House rejects as false. In their compromise, Collins and McCaskill included a provision to exempt the income of small-business owners from the surtax. However, House Republicans questioned whether it was possible to legislate such a distinction. CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: New York Mayor Bloomberg says an agreement must include increased revenue Obama pledges to veto any attempt to soften automatic spending cuts The special joint panel is unable to bridge differences over taxes, entitlements Failure means automatic spending cuts split between defense, domestic programs President Barack Obama and congressional leaders traded blame Monday for the failure of the congressional \u201csuper committee\u201d to forge a deficit reduction deal, but they also called for Congress to work out an agreement before painful automatic budget cuts take place in 2013. Earlier, the co-chairs of the bipartisan special joint committee said in a statement that \u201cafter months of hard work and intense deliberations, we have come to the conclusion today that it will not be possible to make any bipartisan agreement available to the public before the committee\u2019s deadline.\u201d Committee\u2019s failure angers CNN.com readers Markets dropped as news spread of the panel\u2019s expected failure.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 248 points Monday, with a minor recovery after being down more than 300 points earlier in the afternoon. Initial reaction had Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for the inability of the bipartisan committee to negotiate at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction measures. 'We'll trim deficit one way or another' Obama lays blame on Republicans Murray: \"I'll be waiting all day\" Romney: I reject debt deal tax hikes Obama said Republicans in Congress rejected what he called a balanced approach to deficit reduction that included tax increases on the wealthy. \u201cDespite the broad agreement that exists for such an approach, there are still too many Republicans in Congress that have refused to listen to the voices of reason and compromise that are coming from outside of Washington,\u201d Obama told reporters after the super committee announced its failure. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Democrats \u201cwere prepared to strike a grand bargain that would make painful cuts while asking millionaires to pay their fair share, and we put our willingness on paper,\u201d but Republicans \u201cnever came close to meeting us halfway.\u201d His GOP counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, argued that an agreement \u201cproved impossible not because Republicans were unwilling to compromise, but because Democrats would not accept any proposal that did not expand the size and scope of government or punish job creators.\u201d Republican presidential contenders complained that Obama had failed to display necessary leadership to forge an agreement, an accusation rejected by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. \u201cCongress assigned itself a job; assigned 12 of its own members a task \u2013 a task that wasn\u2019t really that difficult to achieve if there was a willingness to compromise,\u201d Carney said of the so-called super committee created under the debt ceiling agreement earlier this year. He added: \u201cCongress needs to meet its responsibilities.\u201d Others lamented and criticized the missed opportunity. \u201cOn its current course the federal government is projected to spend almost $44 trillion over the next 10 years, and it is nothing short of an embarrassment, an absolute national disgrace and failure of leadership that we cannot agree on even a paltry $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over that time frame,\u201d Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said in a statement. Meanwhile, independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who caucuses with the Democratic majority, called for a \u201cbipartisan rebellion\u201d in Congress to strike a deficit deal in the wake of the committee\u2019s failure. Rand Paul:  Congress needs the 'or else' Explain it to me: The 'Super Committee' Super committee on the brink of failure Super committee unlikely to strike deal Grover Norquist weighs in on debt deal Noting that three deficit reduction plans have been proposed, including one by a special commission appointed last year by Obama, Lieberman called for \u201ca vote on the Senate floor before the end of this year, and show that elected officials in Washington are capable of protecting the economic future of the American people.\u201d All three of the plans Lieberman referenced came from bipartisan groups, and all called for a comprehensive package of spending cuts, increased tax revenue and reforms to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Obama and Democrats consider  such an approach the only balanced and fair way to reduce mounting federal deficits and spread the impact across all sectors of society. Republicans seek to shrink government spending and the overall size of government, and therefore reject virtually any kind of increased tax revenue. Both Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, who failed to strike a major deficit reduction agreement earlier this year, called for Congress to continue working for an outcome that would best serve the national interest. \u201cThis process did not end in the desired outcome, but it did bring our enormous fiscal challenges into greater focus,\u201d said a statement by Boehner, R-Ohio. \u201cI am confident the work done by this committee will play a role in the solution we must eventually find as a nation.\u201d Legally, a majority of the 12-member committee had until midnight Wednesday to reach an agreement, but any deal needed to be announced for legislative reasons by the end of Monday. Failure by the committee, evenly split between six Democrats and six Republicans from the House and Senate, sets in motion an alternative timetable for $1.2 trillion in spending reductions starting in January 2013. Leaders on both sides of the aisle are unhappy with the nature of the fallback plan, which cuts evenly from domestic and defense programs. Social Security, Medicaid, food stamps, veterans\u2019 benefits and other politically sensitive programs are spared the budget ax. Pressure has already started to undo a number of cuts included in the fallback plan, which was a product of the summer debt-ceiling agreement. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and key Republicans argue that the military will be undermined by excessive reductions to the Pentagon budget. McConnell raised the idea of softening the automatic cuts in his statement, trying to depict it as a responsibility belonging to the president. \u201cThe good news is that even without an agreement, $1.2 trillion will still be cut from the deficit,\u201d McConnell\u2019s statement said. \u201cNow it falls on the president to ensure that the defense cuts he insisted upon do not undermine national security.\u201d However, Obama made clear that he would veto any attempt to undo or alter the automatic spending cuts, known as a sequester mechanism. \u201cThe only way these spending cuts will not take place is if Congress gets back to work and agrees on a balanced plan to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they need to do. That\u2019s the job they promised to do.  And they\u2019ve still got a year to figure it out.\u201d Obama also sought to reassure markets and ratings agencies that even without an agreement by the special committee, the automatic cuts now scheduled to occur mean significant deficit reduction steps will take place. \u201cOne way or another, we will be trimming the deficit by at least $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years,\u201d he said, referring to a previous agreement for cutting $1 trillion in spending and the required $1.2 trillion in further cuts triggered by the committee\u2019s failure. The ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s issued a statement Monday that said the committee\u2019s failure to reach agreement would not bring a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, as long as the resulting automatic spending cuts remain intact. At the same time, it remains unclear how the sharply divided Congress will reach agreement on a series of looming budget decisions, including an expiring payroll tax cut and calls for a new extension of unemployment benefits. Both questions need to be dealt with by the end of December. Democrats have blasted Republicans for not being more receptive to higher taxes on the wealthy, while Republicans insist Democrats are unwilling to make necessary spending cuts to popular domestic programs. Super committee member Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, told CNN on Monday that Republicans undermined any prospect for genuine compromise by being unwilling to phase out the Bush-era tax cuts for upper-income Americans. \u201cWe got totally hung up by people who were insisting that not only could they not raise any additional revenue from the wealthiest people in the world, but they wanted to give them an additional tax cut,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThis is insanity.\u201d Fellow panel member Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, said Democrats risked throwing the economy back into a recession by trying to use the super committee\u2019s mandate to raise taxes on small businesses and other drivers of job creation. \u201cOur Democratic friends said we won\u2019t cut one dollar more without raising taxes,\u201d Kyl said. \u201cThat tells you a lot about the ethos in Washington. We went into the exercise to try to reduce federal government spending. What we get from the other side is, no, we won\u2019t make more cuts unless you raise taxes.\u201d At the center of the dispute is conservative activist Grover Norquist, head of the group Americans for Tax Reform and author of a popular GOP campaign pledge never to raise taxes. Democrats portray Norquist as an ideological thug who has effectively imposed a reign of terror over congressional Republicans petrified of crossing his group and incurring the wrath of the GOP\u2019s anti-tax base. \u201cGrover has been the 13th member of the (super committee) without being there,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how often we hear about the pledge.\u201d \u201cYou have to do both, and I don\u2019t care what you promise your constituents, I don\u2019t care what your constituents want. Those are the facts,\u201d said Bloomberg, an independent who has been both a Democrat and a Republican. Norquist dismissed such criticism Monday, saying the American people opposed bigger government, and he predicted that the collapse of the talks would set the stage for next year\u2019s campaign. This is \u201cwhat the election of 2012 will be about,\u201d Norquist said.  Do \u201cyou want (President Barack) Obama\u2019s European-sized government or an American-sized smaller government?\u201d There is a \u201cclear distinction between the parties and the direction the country should go in.\u201d It became increasingly clear over the course of the past week that the ideological chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of taxes had simply become too wide. Some key Republicans broke with their party\u2019s anti-tax orthodoxy by backing a proposal by panel member Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, that included $400 billion in increased revenue. Toomey\u2019s plan would have lowered overall income tax rates while limiting tax breaks in a way that would raise $250 billion. Republicans estimated  the reform would have sparked enough economic growth to generate another $110 billion. A change in how tax brackets are adjusted for inflation would have raised another $40 billion. The plan also included $800 billion in spending cuts, thereby hitting the minimum threshold of $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. Democrats, however, called the measure unacceptable in part because it didn\u2019t phase out the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, estimated by nonpartisan budget analysts to cost $800 billion over the next decade. Democrats countered with a proposal to generate $400 billion in new revenue strictly from increased tax collections. At the same time, they wanted to spend $700 billion to help boost the economy, including an extension of the payroll tax cut, extended unemployment benefit payments and money to permanently prevent cuts in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients. Democrats want to offset those costs with money saved from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 a move characterized by some legislators in both parties as an accounting gimmick. Republicans were also bitterly critical of Democrats for their alleged failure to consider more serious reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Last week, panel Republicans floated a last-ditch $640 billion proposal \u2013 not enough to meet the committee\u2019s $1.2 trillion mandate, but enough to help mitigate the impact of the fallback cuts and at least claim partial success. The plan featured roughly $540 billion in spending cuts and fees, the sources noted. Among other things, it raised $3 billion in revenue by closing a highly publicized tax loophole for corporate jet owners. Democrats balked, however, for the same reason they also rejected larger GOP proposals: a lack of \u201cshared sacrifice\u201d in the form of higher taxes on the wealthy, the sources said. \u201cNo person could look at that (alternative plan) and say it met the test of fairness and balance,\u201d said panel member Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland. CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin, Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen and Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Ryan says Republicans agree with calls for corporate tax reform \"I think we'll pass these things,\" he says President Obama is pushing his jobs bill A leading Republican on fiscal and economic issues said Sunday that, in the midst of rampant disagreement in Washington about how best to turn around the faltering economy, he thinks the White House, Democrats, and his party may be able to reach a compromise on corporate tax rates. Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, noted that in a recent speech President Obama spotlighted business tax reform and passage of trade agreements as two areas where agreement might be reached and legislative action could be taken soon.  \u201cGreat,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe agree with those.  Let\u2019s do those.  We\u2019re bringing these trade agreements up next week in the House.  I think we\u2019ll pass these things.\u201d \u201cWhat about business tax reform?\u201d Ryan said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the president seems to be willing to work with us on individual tax reform but on business tax reform.\u201d Ryan added that he believes an agreement on lowering the corporate tax rate is possible and that the work on the bipartisan debt \u201csuper committee\u201d presents an avenue for an agreement to be reached. \u201cI think the super committee should do that.  I think they have the wherewithal to do that.  And I really do believe that that will help us create jobs,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said.  Ryan added that the United States has higher corporate tax rates than other countries.  \u201cAnd we\u2019re losing as a result of it,\u201d he said. Ryan is the architect of a Republican budget proposal that has stoked controversy because of the way it would change Medicare by replacing the traditional insurance benefits the program currently provides with a voucher for a set amount that Medicare recipients could use to purchase health care insurance in the private marketplace. Recently, Ryan has been a fierce critic of Democratic proposals on taxes, spending, and boosting the economy \u2013 a pattern of attack that he continued Sunday. Ryan slammed President Obama when asked about the jobs bill that Obama has been vigorously pushing in speeches, press conferences, and appearances mostly in battleground states. \u201cWhat\u2019s concerning about it is that he\u2019s put ideas in this jobs bill that have already proven to fail.  Instead of trying to get compromise, he\u2019s embracing conflict.  He\u2019s running around the country campaigning on a bill that he knows won\u2019t pass \u2013 he can\u2019t even get it out of the Senate right now \u2013 rather than working with us on ideas that we agree on that would actually help create jobs.\u201d \u201cWe want to go with ideas that work,\u201d Ryan also said. In a press conference about his jobs bill last Thursday, the president responded to the notion that in pushing for his jobs bill, he is laying the groundwork to run a 2012 re-election campaign that faults Congress \u2013 especially congressional Republicans \u2013 for not doing more to help the economy.  At the same time, Obama once again implored Congress to take action. Asked if he was trying to run against a \u201cdo-nothing Congress,\u201d Obama said: \u201cIf Congress does something, then I can\u2019t run against a do-nothing Congress.\u201d \u201cIf Congress does nothing,\u201d the president added, then \u201cI think the American people will run them out of town.\u201d An amended version of Obama\u2019s bill that includes a surtax on millionaires is expected to be voted on in the Democratically-controlled Senate this week.  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office said the new proposal to tax income above $1 million would generate enough revenue to pay the cost of Obama\u2019s $447 billion jobs bill.  The new millionaires tax was added by leading Senate Democrats to make Obama\u2019s bill more palatable to his own party. In the Republican-controlled House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor has said the GOP will not bring the original version of Obama\u2019s bill up for a vote.",

The ad, sponsored by Protect Your Care, also chastised the candidates for standing by as audience members at the CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate cheered at the idea of a man dying because he lacked health insurance. At last week\u2019s debate, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer posed a hypothetical scenario, asking the candidates whether an uninsured man should be left to die if he could not pay his medical bills after a six-month emergency stay in an intensive care unit. Texas Rep. Ron Paul answered by suggesting the expenses could be covered by the man\u2019s friends, neighbors and community churches. Romney changing story on health care? Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann sidestepped the question, addressing, instead, her concerns with President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping health care reform. But support for the idea of letting the man die could be heard coming from debate attendees in the form of applause. In the 30-second ad, images of tea party activists are intermingled with clips of the GOP candidates.

According to a statement, the group is performing outreach to Hispanic voters and perceives Florida to be a ripe battleground state for bringing the GOP to task on issues such as Medicare and Social Security. The group\u2019s ad campaign aims to infiltrate the state\u2019s online and television mediums to express their disdain for health care agendas touted by GOP presidential hopefuls.",

            "article_content": "White House spokesman says neither side will get everything they want Senate leaders renew tough talk as the chamber reconvenes Officials warn debt ceiling must be increased by August 2 to avoid risk of default Washington (CNN) \u2013 President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner met over the weekend as part of ongoing negotiations on an agreement to reduce the country\u2019s deficit, a Republican official told CNN late Tuesday. Also Obama said Tuesday he invited Democratic and Republican leaders from both chambers of Congress to the White House for a meeting Thursday to discuss deficit reduction and the need to raise the federal debt ceiling. Obama said he wanted the meeting to \u201cbuild on the work that\u2019s already been done and drive toward a final agreement\u201d that would address expanding federal deficits and bring congressional approval for increasing how much money the government can borrow. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who earlier invited Obama to come to Congress to discuss the issue, will attend the White House meeting, his office announced. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also plans to attend. Boehner indicated that he will take part but warned that Congress will not accept tax increases sought by Obama and Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m happy to discuss these issues at the White House, but such discussions will be fruitless until the president recognizes economic and legislative reality,\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. He added, \u201cI\u2019m pleased the president stated today that we need to address the big, long-term challenges facing our country.\u201d According to Obama, who made an unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room, talks on deficit reduction over the Fourth of July weekend with congressional leaders from both parties made progress, but \u201cwe still have to work through some real differences.\u201d Both parties need to come out of their \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d Obama said. But \u201cthis should not come down to the last second.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Obama believes that everyone knows the issues involved in forging a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits by as much as $4 trillion in the coming decade. Now it is time make hard decisions, with both sides compromising in order to reach an agreement that benefits the nation as a whole, Carney said. \u201cThe ideal will never become law, whether you\u2019re a conservative House Republican or a liberal Democrat or the president of the United States,\u201d Carney said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get everything you want, because our system doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d The Senate returned to work Tuesday, cutting short the planned weeklong Fourth of July recess, with its leaders resuming their tough talk on negotiations to cut federal deficits amid a looming deadline to raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling. The three-day Fourth of July weekend did little to change the rhetoric of recent weeks over deficit reduction talks and the need for Congress to increase the amount of money the government can borrow. In his opening remarks after the Senate reconvened, Reid, D-Nevada, accused Republicans of putting the nation\u2019s economic recovery at risk by threatening to oppose an increase in how much money the government can borrow. McConnell, R-Kentucky, followed Reid by accusing Democrats of wanting to increase spending to solve a deficit problem. Before Obama\u2019s invitation, McConnell repeated an invitation for Obama to come to Congress and hear from Republicans why they won\u2019t support any agreement that includes tax increases. Reid said his side was willing to compromise but would not allow Republicans to put the needs of \u201ca few millionaires and billionaires\u201d ahead of the rest of the country. With House members scheduled to return Wednesday, congressional leaders remain at sharp odds over what sort of conditions should be attached to a hike in the current $14.3 trillion ceiling. Republicans are refusing to go along with any increase unless it includes deep spending cuts and avoids any tax increases. Democrats are trying to minimize the impact of cuts to social services and are calling for the elimination to certain tax breaks and loopholes benefiting wealthier Americans. Treasury Department officials and leading economists have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the ceiling is not raised by August 2, at which point the country could default on its debt obligations. Among other things, the country could face skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar. Increasing the debt ceiling will allow the government to borrow more money in order to pay for spending already accrued. Given the short time frame, Congress and the White House may be forced to agree to a relatively small increase in the debt ceiling covering only a few months. Such a compromise \u2013 including cuts already agreed to on both sides of the aisle \u2013 would give leaders more time to negotiate serious budget reforms, including possible changes to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. However, Obama said he\u2019s opposed to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people sent us here to avoid tough problems,\u201d Obama said. The debt ceiling dispute is a \u201c\u2018unique opportunity to do something big\u201d and put the \u201ceconomy on a stronger footing for the future.\u201d Over the weekend, top Democrats and Republicans gave no public indication that a potential compromise is in the offing. Talks led by Vice President Joe Biden recently collapsed over the tax dispute. \u201cThe principle of not raising taxes is something that we campaigned on last November, and the results of the election was the American people don\u2019t want their taxes raised and they wanted us to cut spending,\u201d Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t want compromise.\u201d Various frameworks for a possible deal have been floated. Conservatives demand deep spending cuts, caps on future spending and a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution in return for their support to raise the debt ceiling. Both the House and Senate are planning votes on a balanced budget amendment in coming weeks. However, with such an amendment requiring approval from a two-thirds majority in both chambers and then ratification by at least 38 states, eventual approval is unclear in a process that can take years. For his part, Obama has chided congressional Republicans for refusing to make \u201ctough decisions\u201d at odds with their conservative base. He calls for what he characterizes as a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes more revenue for education, infrastructure and clean energy, areas he considers critical to long-term economic growth. The Democratic position includes spending cuts elsewhere, including the military, as well as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the indigent. Republicans seek more sweeping entitlement reforms that Democrats contend would eliminate the safety net the programs were intended to provide.
