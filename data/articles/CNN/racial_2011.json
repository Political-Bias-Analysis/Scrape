            "article_content": "Programming note: Does your vote for congressional candidates really matter? It might depend on where you live. Is your neighborhood election \u201calmost rigged,\u201d as one expert suggests? Tune in to \u201cGerry-Rigged,\u201d a special CNN Presents on Sunday night at 8 ET for a look at how boundaries for voting districts play a crucial role in our elections. Redistricting is \"almost rigged\" to favor parties in power, expert says In the past decade, 78% of House seats did not change party hands Race has been used to create a political divide in the South Expert blames gerrymandering for polarization of Congress Outside Independence Hall, ask a graduate student in line to see the Liberty Bell what he thinks of gerrymandering, and you might get this answer: \u201cI think Gerry Mandering is a great guy.\u201d No, he isn\u2019t. Gerrymandering and race: What's legal? Gerrymandering is the term for the way politicians draw boundary lines for legislative districts in a way designed to keep one party or the other in power in that particular district. In the last 10 years, 78% of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives \u2013 almost four out of every five members of Congress \u2013 did not change party hands even once. In California, with 53 seats \u2013 the most in the nation \u2013 incumbents were kept so safe that only one of those seats changed party control in the past decade. David Wasserman, redistricting expert for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, says only 20 races for Congress are expected to be tossups in the 2012 election.  That\u2019s only 20 out of the 435 seats in the House. \u201cIn general elections, it\u2019s almost rigged,\u201d he said. More on the history behind gerrymandering The lines are redrawn for seats in Congress each 10 years after the U.S. Census measures population shifts.  That process is going on now in states across the country. Among CNN\u2019s findings: The South Race has been used to create a political divide in the South.  In the five Deep Dixie states \u2013 South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana \u2013 only nine Democrats are left in Congress.  Only one is white. He is Georgia Democrat John Barrow, and Republican control in that state\u2019s legislature has led to his home city of Savannah being excluded from his current district. In 2010, Republicans captured control of North Carolina\u2019s legislature for the first time since shortly after the Civil War.  They drew district lines in a way to pack 49% of all of North Carolina\u2019s  African-American voters in just three of the state\u2019s 13 congressional districts.  That left the other 10 districts mostly white and predictably Republican. Democrats in North Carolina accuse the GOP of  political \u201cresegregation.\u201d  A court battle is looming. Illinois After the GOP landslide in 2010, this is the only battleground state winning or losing a seat where Democrats remain in control.  They pushed through their new map over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.  Most of the five freshmen Republicans elected to Congress last time will face difficult races to return for a second term. Nowhere is gerrymandering more apparent than in Chicago\u2019s 4th District, where a grassy strip hardly a football field wide, stuck in between two expressways, connects the top and bottom halves of a district designed to keep a Hispanic in Congress. According to the 4th District Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat,  Chicago has an Irish district, a Polish district, a Jewish district and three black districts.  Look at a map and all have irregular, unusual lines.  This is not a matter of party control.  All the incumbents are Democrats.  The lines preserve racial and ethnic heritages. In Illinois, it is the GOP that is suing Democrats to try to overturn the new map. California Voters have revolted.  In 2010, they passed an amendment to the state constitution to take redistricting out of political hands and have a citizens commission redraw the lines.  It was forbidden to favor incumbents. As a result, more than half of California\u2019s 53 representatives were placed in the same district with another colleague for the 2012 election.  As many as 15 could lose or else face retirement to avoid losing. \u201cFifteen out of 53 does not sound like a lot,\u201d Wasserman said.  \u201cBut compared to most other states, that\u2019s an avalanche.\u201d Party politics did give way to social politics.  Latinos, who accounted for most of California\u2019s population growth, could win as many as nine seats next year.  The African-American population shrank, but under pressure, the citizens commission retained the three traditionally black seats in south Los Angeles. Florida Voter reform met resistance here.  Three million people voted to pass amendments last year that say the legislature cannot not favor or penalize incumbents or political parties when it redraws the lines. Two members of Congress \u2013 Democrat Corrine Brown, who is African-American, and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart, who is Hispanic \u2013 filed a lawsuit in federal court to try to overturn what the voters had done.  Florida\u2019s House of Representatives, using taxpayer money, hired a law firm to support them in opposing the taxpayers\u2019 will.  Their argument:  The U.S. Constitution has given the legislature the sole responsibility for redistricting. In general elections, it\u2019s almost rigged. David Wasserman, Cook Political Report A federal judge rejected that argument and threw out the lawsuit.  But the two incumbents, supported by the legislature, are appealing, and they say the case could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Iowa For three decades now, Iowa has had a nonpartisan redistricting system.  Two legislative staffers draw the maps in secrecy without political interference.  \u201cIn Iowa, it is understood incumbent protection is not the name of the game,\u201d one of those staffers said. As a result, Iowa has the nation\u2019s only congressional race next year where a longtime Republican incumbent, Tom Latham, is paired against a longtime Democratic incumbent, Leonard Boswell. Past voting patterns indicate they could be separated by no more than 1%, either way. Iowans like it this way, and that includes Latham.  He said, \u201cI think if you sit in a very safe district, a lot of times these people will ignore the public will.  They won\u2019t have to listen because they can do whatever they want to, and vote however they want to, and not be held accountable for it.\u201d As Wasserman put it, \u201cAmericans are basically between the ideological 40-yard lines.  But the districts aren\u2019t.  And that\u2019s part of the reason Congress is so polarized.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidates face off in the Western Republican Debate, moderated by Anderson Cooper at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday on CNN, the CNN mobile apps and CNN.com/Live. Of Nevada's 2.7 million residents, 26% are Hispanic. In 2010, Latinos were key to Harry Reid's come-from-behind victory. Nevada gained a new  district after census, in part due to Hispanic population growth A tour outside the casino zone in Las Vegas reveals the Latino influence in Nevada. The billboards and shops advertising in Spanish anything from Mexican, Venezuelan or Salvadoran food to a relaxing massage are just as prevalent as the iconic neon signs in Las Vegas. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population in Nevada grew 35% in the last decade, and of the state\u2019s 2.7 million residents, 26% are Hispanic.  The growth in the number of Hispanic residents has quickly translated into political power. Kenneth Fernandez, a political science professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, is among many who credit the Latino vote for saving Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s job in the 2010 election. \u201cHispanic turnout in the mid-term election was higher than in the 2008 election,\u201d he said. All eyes on Nevada for the 2012 Republican race State Sen. Moises \u201cMo\u201d Denis says that for state politicians seeking office, courting Latinos is a must. \u201cYou won\u2019t win (on) the Latino vote alone, but you can\u2019t win without it,\u201d he said. That newfound influence has sparked a controversy about the best way to address Latino representation at the state and national level. \u201cYou won\u2019t win (on) the Latino vote alone, but you can\u2019t win without it\u201d State Sen. Moises \"Mo\" Denis Nevada gained a new congressional district, thanks to the population increase fueled by Hispanics. The Democratic-controlled Nevada Legislature has twice approved new congressional maps spreading the Latino community into three of the four districts. \u201cThe challenge is how to draw the lines in a way that is fair, that ensures equal representation and to ensure that all communities can elect the representatives of their choice,\u201d said state Senate Majority leader Steven Horsford. Cain leaps to the top of the pack King: Cain not prepared for challenge Rick Perry hammers EPA in energy speech But Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval has twice vetoed the maps approved by the legislation. He argued that the maps, without a Latino majority district, violate the spirit of the Voting Rights Act, which bans racial discrimination in voting practices. Sandoval\u2019s staff didn\u2019t return repeated CNN requests for comment, but when he vetoed a proposed redistricting map in May, he said the maps were unacceptable. \u201cWith Hispanics accounting for 46% of the total population growth in our state over the last 10 years, this transparent effort to avoid creating even one additional district where this community would be likely to elect its candidate of choice is simply not acceptable.\u201d Cain\u2019s race not as big an issue with conservatives The sentiment is echoed by other Republicans. \u201cThe Latino community has been very good to the Democratic Party for so many years you would think they would be the first to promote a district to represent the Latinos and to elect candidates of their choice,\u201d said Alex Garza, a Republican activist who introduced a map carving a district with a Hispanic majority that he says would increase the chances of getting a Latino elected to Congress. \u201cFor the longest time, we have been yelling at the top of our lungs that we wanted fair representation, that we wanted access to opportunity, that we wanted a seat at the table,\u201d Garza said. Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to \u201cpack\u201d Hispanics into one district, thereby negating their influence elsewhere in the state. Denis says the time for a single Latino district has passed, arguing Hispanics live in more than one area and that should be reflected on the maps. \u201cIf we have influence in three districts, then the candidates will have to come to the community and pay attention to our needs rather than being dismissed and conceding the single Latino district,\u201d he explained. Garza disagrees.  He says the moment is now for Hispanics not only to be part of the political conversation but to be the ones setting the agenda. \u201cOur population is going to continue to grow over the next years so we are not going to be held to one single seat,\u201d he said. The maps are now in the hands of a three-member panel known as the \u201cmasters,\u201d who were appointed by a federal judge.  The panel must decide the legality of the districts based on the Voting Rights Act and ensure that all groups are fairly represented. Activists and other groups have spoken out both against and in favor of a Hispanic majority district, but political consultant Marco Rauda says it is hard to get a good read on where the Latino community stands on the issue. \u201cReapportioning is a new process for the Latino community, so we are now trying to educate them on the issue,\u201d he said. Carville: 2012 GOP field pathetic Fernandez says both parties are using the Hispanic voters as an excuse to gain from the redistricting process. \u201cTheir No.1 goal is to protect incumbents,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they\u2019ll move to gain strategic advantage on the districts and then they\u2019ll consider Hispanic representation.\u201d Fernandez also said that in Nevada, Latinos have been able to get elected in non-Latino majority districts. He points to the election of Sandoval, who won even though a majority of Hispanics did not vote for him. Denis says he himself is proof that a Hispanic-majority district is not a guarantee a Latino will be elected. \u201cTen years ago I lost in a newly created Hispanic district for the state assembly,\u201d he said. Regardless of the outcome, Fernandez thinks the Nevada Latinos are already the winners of the debate. \u201cJust the attention they are getting is demonstrating that this sleeping giant is an important player that is only going to motivate and activate Latino voters,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "In recent weeks, Obama's support among blacks has been beset by troubles Among them: CBC scolding, hardball questions on BET, black jobless numbers He faces a balancing act in the 2012 campaign in appealing to various blocs Sociologist Reginald Daniel: \"Finding a middle ground is almost an impossibility\" Even as he charges into his re-election battle, President Barack Obama has a festering weakness on a flank that, by all accounts, ought to be rock solid: the one held by African-American Democrats. Their support for his programs, belief in his leadership and enthusiasm for another term is softening just as he needs it most. In the past few weeks, the president has been chastised by the Congressional Black Caucus for avoiding troubled inner-city districts, peppered with tough questions on BET, and suffered plummeting poll numbers among black voters. That last item is critical. During the 2008 election, their turnout was massive and their support almost unanimous. Now, however, a Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that black voters with a \u201cstrongly favorable\u201d view of Obama dropped from 86% to 58% in just five months. \u201cPatience is running out,\u201d says Reginald Daniel, a professor of sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Daniel has written extensively about race and politics. \u201cPeople are disappointed because I think their expectations were way too high to begin with.\u201d Many political analysts sum up those \u201cexpectations run amok\u201d this way: White voters heralded the election of a black president as a sign that long-standing racial gaps were closing, and they expected Obama to play a post-racial role; a president for everyone, who just happened to be black. Meanwhile, many African-American voters just as clearly saw his election as a great leap forward and hoped the presence of a black president in the Oval Office would bring a new level of understanding, acknowledgment, and relief for their community\u2019s problems. \u201cFinding a middle ground is almost an impossibility,\u201d Daniels says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the worst position to be in.\u201d The driving problem, however, is neither black nor white \u2013 it is green. Joblessness, bad for everyone, is much worse in African-American communities, where unemployment is pushing 17%, the worst since the 1980s. That is what triggered the revolt in the CBC and those stinging questions during that TV interview. The president is pushing back, pointing out that his initiatives, such as health care reform and the recent jobs bill, especially help lower-income families, many of whom are black. On BET, he quickly dismissed talk about a dearth of specific programs for minorities. \u201cWhat people are saying all across the country is we are hurting and we\u2019ve been hurting for a long time,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe question is: How can we make sure the economy is working for every single person?\u201d He also insisted that even if black leaders are grousing, it\u2019s not really about him or his policies. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be somebody who is critical of the president of the United States.\u201d And at a CBC fundraising dinner he raised eyebrows by telling members to quit complaining and start \u201cmarching\u201d with him for change. But if the reaction of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, is any gauge, he\u2019ll have to do a lot more selling. She summed up his comments in a word: \u201cCurious.\u201d To be sure, most African-Americans still support Obama. Political analysts do not expect a massive shift of their votes to the Republicans; and even the president\u2019s most adamant black critics often follow their barbs with a quick salve, saying African-American voters ultimately will not oppose him. Still, the danger for the White House is not that black citizens will vote against Obama, but that they won\u2019t vote at all. A lackluster turnout in just a few key states could tip the electoral balance against him. What\u2019s more, every moment he spends making sure black Democrats come to the polls increases his risk of alienating white voters, and is time lost winning over independents, whom he also must have. Politically, it is hard for a candidate to tiptoe through such a black-and-white minefield. For a president, it is even tougher.",

            "article_content": "By Stephanie Siek, CNN (CNN) \u2013 A study that examines three years of opinion survey data says that black\u00a0and white\u00a0Americans are still miles apart regarding their perceptions of equality or inequality among blacks and whites. It identifies racial bias among whites as a potential reason for that difference in perception. \u201cPost-Racial? Americans and Race in the Age of Obama,\u201d released Monday by the nonprofit Greenlining Institute, found a link between white survey respondents\u2019\u00a0perception of blacks and whether they believed discriminition to be a major problem in today\u2019s society. When asked how much discimination\u00a0currently exists\u00a0in America, 56.4% of black respondents said there was \u201ca lot.\u201d Among Latinos, 26.9% gave that answer. About the same amount \u2013 26% - of respondents who reported their race as \u201cother\u201d said that. But only 16% of white respondents said they thought \u201ca lot\u201d of discrimination existed in today\u2019s America. The majority of white respondents said there was either \u201csome\u201d (44.4%) or \u201ca little\u201d (39.5%) discrimination. White people who said there was \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca little\u201d discrimination were more likely to agree with statements such as \u201cIrish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors,\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s really just a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.\u201d The Greenlining Institute study analyzed data from the American National Election Panel Survey (ANES) conducted by the University of Michigan and Stanford University, as well as census data. The ANES\u00a0researchers spoke with\u00a0a representative sample of about 1,800 Americans on 12 occasions between January 2008 and July 2010. Greenlining is a nonprofit policy and leadership institute whose stated goal is to work for economic and racial equality. \u201cAmericans are diversifying and if we want to keep ahead and keep America going forward, we have to acknowledge these disparities. If we don\u2019t, it makes it hard to tackle them,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Byrd, the Greenlining Institute\u2019s research director and the study\u2019s primary author. Tim Wise is anti-racist essayist and activist whose work often deals with white responses to racism.\u00a0 He says that white disbelief in black claims of discrimination is nothing new \u2013 and that white people need to take a closer look at why so many people of color believe they are subject to prejudice. \u201cI think they need to reflect on why there\u2019s such a division,\u201d said Wise, who is white. \u201cThere\u2019s only two ways you can interpret it: You can either interpret that [black people] are insane and borderline neurotic, that they don\u2019t know their own life; or you could look at it and say maybe black people do know their own life, and maybe it\u2019s worth listening to them about it.\u201d Among the study\u2019s other findings: \u2022 Although 62% of white people questioned in the survey believed that blacks\u2019\u00a0 level of health was about the same as their own, only 43.8% of blacks agreed. But according to\u00a0statistical data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Office of Minority Health,\u00a0there are\u00a0definite disparities in health and health care.\u00a0 As of 2007, white life expectancy at birth was 4.8 years higher than for blacks.\u00a0\u00a0The infant mortality rate among black women was almost two and a half times higher than for white women. The asthma rate among black children is double that of white children. \u2022 More than two-thirds of black people surveyed (67%) believed that black people in general make less money than whites. But the majority of whites (59%) believed that they made about the same. According to U.S. Department of Labor statistics, blacks\u2019 median weekly earnings were as much as $500 less than the median earnings of whites between 2009 and 2011. \u2022 Another question asked who the U.S. government treated better: blacks or whites. Twenty-eight percent of whites believed that blacks\u00a0were treated better, and 63% thought\u00a0the races\u00a0were treated about equally. But only 1 percent of blacks thought they were treated better, and most blacks believed that whites either received better treatment\u00a0 (56.4%) or were treated about the same by the federal government (42.5%). Why is there such a gap between how much discrimination is reported by blacks versus how much is believed to exist by whites? Wise says that the reason why whites don\u2019t know or don\u2019t acknowledge the racism or discrimination experienced by blacks and other people of color is because they don\u2019t have to know or acknowledge it. \u201cNo matter what I want to do with my life, to demonstrate that I know the reality of people of color is not going to be on the test,\u201d Wise said. \u201cBut for people of color to get a job, any job, they\u2019re going to have to know the things that white folks in those fields think are valuable pieces of information. People of color have to know white knowledge, white wisdom, and what their experience is, but white people don\u2019t have to know the experiences of people of color.\u201d",
