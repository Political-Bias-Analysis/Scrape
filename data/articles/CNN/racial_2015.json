            "article_content": "NEW: Protesters take to the streets of Chicago A Democratic state legislator from Chicago says the voters have lost trust in Mayor Rahm Emanuel His bill, if approved, would create a mechanism that would allow the embattled mayor to be ousted from office Amid ongoing protests in the city of Chicago, an Illinois state legislator who introduced a bill that would allow Rahm Emanuel to be removed from office by a recall vote says city residents feel abandoned by the embattled mayor. \u201cWe have not seen the tip of the iceberg yet,\u201d Rep. La Shawn Ford said on Thursday, saying voters had lost \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d in the mayor. \u201cPeople are hurt, people have died, people feel that they are forgotten about in the city of Chicago,\u201d the Chicago Democrat added. Legislation drafted by Ford would revise a 1941 law and create a ballot procedure for voters in the city to petition for Emanuel\u2019s ouster. He said he hadn\u2019t wanted to introduce his recall measure but constituents were demanding it. Emanuel, a former congressman and chief of staff to President Barack Obama, has come under fire for his handling of the city\u2019s police force, which the Department of Justice announced on Tuesday would be subject to a federal investigation. In a statement, Emanuel\u2019s office brushed off the prospect of a recall election, saying \u201cthe mayor\u2019s focus is not on his own personal politics.\u201d Opinion: Rahm Emanuel must resign Ford, however, expects the pressure \u2013 and protests \u2013 to grow. \u201cUntil there is real change and real reform in the way the city of Chicago is operating, I don\u2019t think people are going to let up,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are not going to let up because this is the moment the people who really fight for justice and equality in Chicago have been waiting for. \u201cRight now, the city is disturbed, the city is all messed up right now.\u201d Thursday night, protesters again took to the streets of Chicago, as they have since the release of dashcam footage that shows the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. They marched from the Chicago Federal Building to City Hall, passing downtown stores. Some demonstrators lay down in protest. Others carried placards and chanted. A post shared by Martin Savidge (@martinsavidge) With pressure on the mayor growing, the often-caustic Emanuel struck a conciliatory tone when he addressed the Chicago City Council on Wednesday. Rahm Emanuel: 'I own it' \u201cI own it,\u201d he said, at times appearing emotional. \u201cI take responsibility for what happened, because it happened on my watch. \u2026 If we\u2019re also going to begin the healing process \u2026 the first step in that journey is my step. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Obama silent on fate of Emanuel amid racial unrest But Ford was not impressed. \u201cWhat I felt while watching it and after watching it,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we had a mayor that was elected to govern the city, yet he was surprised by how the city operated.\u201d Video showing the shooting of 17-year-old McDonald, which eventually led to a first degree murder charge against Officer Jason Van Dyke, was withheld from the public and only released after a court order. Emanuel, who won a second term after a run-off election this spring, has since fired the city\u2019s superintendent of police. Emanuel\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.",

            "article_content": "Embattled Chicago Mayor Emanuel served as Obama's first White House chief of staff \"The President does have some limitations on what he can say on this manner,\" White House says President Barack Obama, long in pursuit of balance between outrage and reconciliation on issues of race and violence, is facing an infinitely more complex calculus in Chicago, where the streets of his hometown are filling with angry protests. 'Black lives matter' protests Unlike other cities where the combustable pairing of police brutality and systemic racism sparked nights of rage, Obama\u2019s ties to Chicago \u2013 where he maintains a residence and where he\u2019ll build his presidential library \u2013 run deep. With his former top aide, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, facing increasingly loud calls to resign, Obama\u2019s strategy for now is to remain silent, citing ongoing Justice Department investigations into the police shooting that first prompted the protests. \u201cThe President does have some limitations on what he can say on this manner, given that he is the President of the United States and an attorney general that he appointed is leading an agency that\u2019s conducting an independent investigation,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Wednesday. Last week, Earnest said that \u201cby commenting on this at great length, I think would be viewed by some as improperly interfering with an ongoing independent criminal investigation.\u201d Chicago mayor says \u2018painful and honest reckoning\u2019 needed When protesters filled streets in Ferguson and Baltimore, Obama was similarly constrained by what he could say publicly given his administration\u2019s probes into the cities\u2019 law enforcement tactics. But in those cases, it often seemed like he wanted to say more \u2013 either to denounce ingrown racial biases where they appeared, or to demand incompetent officials step down. This time, however, Obama finds himself confronting a different scenario. Opinion: After police shootings, Chicago faces crisis of trust The year in politics Instead of previously unknown local officials, the calls for resignation this time are directed at Emanuel, his friend and first White House chief of staff. Protesters filling downtown Chicago streets have called for Emanuel to step down, accusing him of delaying for political reasons the release of a damning dashboard camera video showing police killing Laquan McDonald, the black teenager who was shot 16 times after he collapsed to the ground. Obama\u2019s own home, in leafy Hyde Park, sits just 10 miles from the far grittier stretch of Pulaski Road where  McDonald was gunned down by police more than a year ago. The planned site for Obama\u2019s presidential library \u2013 which Emanuel spent much of his first term navigating sticky zoning rules to secure \u2013  is near where another black man, Ronald Johnson III, was killed by police in 2014. If Obama was left stifled after Ferguson and Baltimore, unable to demand greater accountability from those cities\u2019 leaders while investigations unfolded, he seems buffered this time around from uncomfortable questions about his former top aide\u2019s handling of police brutality \u2013 a crisis that\u2019s led to the shakiest moment of Emanuel\u2019s decades-long career. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough time for the mayor and the city. But it also is an historic opportunity to confront an issue that has been around for generations,\u201d said David Axelrod, a longtime Chicagoan who, as former senior adviser to Obama, worked closely with both the President and Emanuel. Axelrod is a CNN senior political commentator. The White House says the President last visited with Emanuel during a trip to Chicago in October, but hasn\u2019t consulted the mayor about the recent protests. Earnest offered an equivocal assessment of Emanuel\u2019s handling of the episode on Thursday. \u201cThe President obviously knows and respects Mayor Emanuel, but in terms of rendering judgment about his fitness to continue to lead the city of Chicago, the voters of that city will have to make that determination for themselves,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite clear that many of them will make that determination based on how he takes responsibility for and follows through on his commitment to implement needed reforms in the Chicago Police Department.\u201d On Wednesday, Emanuel told a special City Council meeting he took full responsibility for the circumstances surrounding the teenager\u2019s death. \u201cI own it \u2026 It happened on my watch,\u201d the mayor said during an emotion-filled address. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re going to fix it, I want you to understand that it\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d Last week, Emanuel fired the head of the Chicago Police Department, saying he\u2019d become a distraction to the issues at hand. But the firing and the apology haven\u2019t stopped protesters from venting their anger in the streets, and continuing to call for him to step down. One state lawmaker \u2013  a Democrat \u2013 introduced legislation that would allow for the recall of a Chicago mayor. \u201cI expect a turbulent period,\u201d Axelrod said, noting that the Justice Department investigation into Chicago\u2019s police renders the situation less of an issue for the White House. \u201cBut the mayor will be judged by what he does over the coming months, and he clearly knows it.\u201d No one at the White House, let alone in Chicago politics, expects the famously combative Emanuel to leave his post anytime soon. He was re-elected in April, and his term runs until 2019. But this year\u2019s mayoral battle, rather than a decisive victory for Emanuel, only reflected the deep-seeded racial tensions that persisted during his his first term. His main challenger was a fellow Democrat, Jesus Chuy Garcia, who garnered support from Chicago\u2019s Latino community. The race went to a runoff, despite a campaign trail appearance from Obama days before the general election. Race and Reality in America: Five key findings \u201cEverybody knows that he is passionate and he is tough and he is dogged in making sure that the city of Chicago is not just the coldest city, but also the greatest city,\u201d Obama said during a visit to Emanuel\u2019s campaign office in February. Obama himself has weighed in on the Chicago situation only once, writing on Facebook in November he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by police dashboard camera footage showing police shooting 17-year-old McDonald after he had collapsed on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m personally grateful to the people of my hometown for keeping protests peaceful,\u201d Obama wrote. But since then Obama hasn\u2019t said anything about the situation in Chicago. A slate of press conferences over the last two weeks focused instead on pressing foreign issues, rather than the situation in Obama\u2019s hometown. Earnest said that even if Obama were asked, there is little he\u2019d likely be able to say about the problems back home. \u201cIt is the kind of thing that I think the President intends to speak about more freely once he is the former President of the United States,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cBut until then, his ability to communicate about this at great length is limited.\u201d",

The 13-year-old, whose past attacks on President Barack Obama have gone viral on YouTube, told CNN that he has come to believe Sanders is the best candidate to address racial issues, police brutality and poverty. \u201cThis election will make a pivotal difference in the future of our nation. If it takes changing your mind to make the right choice as to who should lead our country, I am willing to do it. Screw the optics,\u201d Pearson, the former chairman of Teens for Ted Cruz, told CNN. Read: Bernie Sanders\u2019 Freddie Gray tour \u201cPeople are struggling in America. We need the right man in the White House. And in my opinion, that man is Senator Bernie Sanders.\u201d Pearson, who lives in Georgia, has become something of a viral star \u2013 his YouTube channel has received more than 5 million views, he has 37,000 followers on Twitter, and 100,000 likes on his Facebook page. Pearson, an African-American who once referred to the Black Lives Matter movement as \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d  said he bolted the conservative movement due to its \u201clack of concern over racial discrimination in this country.\u201d RELATED: Pearson renounces conservatism He also said the video of Laquan McDonald being shot 16 times by a police officer in Chicago educated him on what he called the prevalence of \u201csystemic racism\u201d in America. \u201cSystemic racism is real. Police brutality is real. Youth unemployment is real. Income inequality is real. Poverty in the richest country in the world is real,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThere is only one candidate that has shown enough courage to accept these issues as a painful reality and has released plans to tackle every single one of them. That candidate, that courageous trailblazer, is Bernie Sanders. That\u2019s how I made my decision.\u201d Pearson, whose personal website features endorsements from conservative leaders such as Rand Paul and Allen West, said his mentors weren\u2019t pleased with his sudden political aboutface. \u201cThey weren\u2019t happy, but honestly, I didn\u2019t expect them to be. I have to be my own person. I have to stand on my own two feet,\u201d said Pearson, who plans to continue his social media activism. \u201cMy activism is centered around fighting to give young people a voice in their government and in the political arena,\u201d said Pearson, executive director of Young Georgians of Government. \u201cWith President Sanders, young people will have that voice. So, in my opinion, I\u2019m doing exactly what I set out to do at the beginning of my political career.\u201d In September, Pearson was accused of falsely claiming that Obama\u2019s Twitter account had blocked him. Pearson admits he made a mistake.",

            "article_content": "Some activists are calling on Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to step down The push comes after a video released by the city shows a black man being shot by a white police officer 16 times The video took more than a year after the incident to be released -- a time span in which Emanuel was reelected Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is facing the toughest challenge of his four-year-old administration amid protests over the way his city responded when a white police officer shot a black teenager 16 times last year. After video of the October 16, 2014, shooting of Laquan McDonald was released last week, Emanuel asked the city\u2019s police superintendent to resign Tuesday. Some activists and political opponents say that Emanuel, a three-term congressman and former chief of staff to President Barack Obama, should step down as well. He insisted Wednesday he would not heed those calls. \u201cWe have a process called the election,\u201d he said at an event sponsored by Politico. \u201cThe voters spoke. I\u2019ll be held accountable for the decisions and actions that I make.\u201d That Emanuel \u2013 who\u2019s been a high-profile Democratic political warrior for decades in Congress and in the White House \u2013 is struggling so publicly is significant. His trademark brash attitude, which helped earn him his power and status, is running headlong into a national movement confronting police brutality and racial discrimination. For a politician who\u2019s had a habit of making enemies throughout his career, Emanuel is now trying to make amends. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the end of the problem,\u201d he said Tuesday, after announcing a task force on police accountability. \u201cI think this is beginning of the solution. And we\u2019re going to work through this on a consistent basis to make the changes.\u201d That\u2019s not enough for some Chicago activists \u2013 as well as some high-profile national voices. When asked by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Tuesday whether he should go, movie director Spike Lee said, \u201cI think so.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re calling for Rahm\u2019s neck too, his head,\u201d Lee said. \u201cA lot of questions have to be answered. Who made the decision? Why was this tape was held for so long? And who saw the tape?\u201d Lee premiered his movie, \u201cChi-Raq\u201d in Chicago on Tuesday evening, a film based in the Windy City and focusing on its gun violence. Johnetta Elzie, an activist affiliated with Campaign Zero, an organization aiming to end police violence, tweeted that Emanuel is part of the problem. \u201cBy these standards @RahmEmanuel, you should be dismissed as well,\u201d she tweeted Tuesday. By these standards @RahmEmanuel, you should be dismissed as well. https://t.co/TqdGgYXopZ pic.twitter.com/I4ar3mEIvl University of Chicago graduate student Devon Jerome Crawford, who was arrested Monday with NAACP President Cornell William Brooks while protesting outside of Chicago City Hall, told CNN Tuesday that Emanuel needs to resign. \u201cMayor Rahm Emanuel is implicated in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald,\u201d he said. \u201cThis killing indicates the detachment of city leaders from the plight of black, teenage youth on the South Side of Chicago and a willingness by the city to criminalize blackness as opposed to reforming structural inequality.\u201d Exacerbating the fallout of from the shooting that killed McDonald is that the video was released more than a year after the initial incident, a time period during which Emanuel was reelected. Rahiel Tesfamariam, an activist and publisher of Urban Cusp magazine, questioned whether Emanuel\u2019s career would have survived if the video had come to light sooner. \u201cWould Chicago have re-elected @RahmEmanuel if they knew about #LaquanMcDonald? If he won\u2019t resign (he won\u2019t), then demand a mayoral recall,\u201d she tweeted Tuesday. Would Chicago have re-elected @RahmEmanuel if they knew about #LaquanMcDonald? If he won't resign (he won't), then demand a mayoral recall. 1 down:Garry McCarthy2 to go:Rahm Emanuel Anita AlvarezThe whole damn system is guilty a hell.#LaquanMcDonald The controversial video was made public only after a freelance journalist filed suit, arguing that it was public record. The city went to court to prevent its being released, arguing that doing so would interfere with a federal investigation and a probe by the state\u2019s attorney. A judge sided with the journalist, and the footage was released last week. Jason Van Dyke, the officer who shot McDonald, has been charged with first-degree murder. Emanuel has repeatedly denied that he was involved in keeping the video from being released for political gains, though his re-election opponent, Cook County Commissioner Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, accused him of such. \u201cThe mayor has been involved in an effort to conceal information regarding this incident, this tragedy, this miscarriage of justice,\u201d Garcia told Chris Cuomo on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cIt was obvious that the video would have had a profound impact had it been released when it occurred and the mayor has taken great steps to ensure that it is concealed.\u201d Chicago Alderman Will Burns says many of the calls for Emanuel\u2019s resignation are from people who have long opposed the mayor politically and may be using McDonald\u2019s death to air their grievances. \u201cThere are people who have called for Rahm Emanuel\u2019s resignation, but a lot of those people supported \u2026 Garcia in the last election,\u201d he told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThe idea that people who weren\u2019t previously supportive of Rahm Emanuel would suddenly be supportive now fails the test of logic.\u201d Burns, the son of a police officer, is optimistic that the city\u2019s new leaders can implement the changes needed. \u201cWe just got elected in 2015. We\u2019ve got a long way to go before the 2019 cycle to deal with these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of momentum within the black caucus in the City Council for systematic changes.\u201d Although Sylvia Ewing worked on Garcias\u2019 mayoral campaign against Emanuel, she told CNN Tuesday that Emanuel resigning is not in the best interest of Chicagoans. \u201cGrowing into a leader who is a servant of the people is what he must do,\u201d said Ewing, who teaches leadership at Columbia College Chicago. \u201cI hope he will learn the lesson of Mayor Daley before him and use his second term to bring some of his critics into his administration.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Fantz and Holly Yan contributed to this report.",

Opinion: Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre statements Trump was not asked by the Fox News hosts about the comments made by his campaign. Donald Trump's empire The protester, 31-year-old Black Lives Matter activist Mercutio Southall, said the attendees who attacked him also called him and two fellow protestors \u201cmonkeys\u201d and the N-word. He told CNN he was \u201cswarmed\u201d by attendees at the Trump event after he and the others began chanting \u201cDump the Trump\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d during the Republican front-runner\u2019s speech to several thousand supporters. The slurs cannot be heard on the video CNN recorded of the incident, and the network was unable to independently confirm them. Trump had warned in August after Black Lives Matter activists disrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event that if the movement\u2019s activists protested one of his events, they would have a fight on their hands. \u201cThat will never happen with me,\u201d Trump said after Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, let Black Lives Matter activists take over one of his events. Donald Trump: I\u2019ve been \u2018a little childish\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do the fighting myself, or if other people will,\u201d Trump said then. As Southall took blows on Saturday, Trump tried to press on with his stump speech, but paused to remark at the apparent disruption and said, \u201cGet \u2018em the hell out of here.\u201d Southall, who said his grandparents crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, compared the experience to facing a \u201clynch mob.\u201d \u201cI got punched in the face, I got punched in the neck. I got kicked in the chest. Kicked in the stomach. Somebody stepped on my hand,\u201d Southall said, describing his injuries in a phone call with CNN late Saturday. Southall said the man in a blue-checkered shirt who appears to take a fighting stance in CNN\u2019s video of the altercation also choked him while he was on the ground. Southall said the choking only stopped when he punched the man in the groin. A woman in the video can be heard shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t choke him, don\u2019t choke him, don\u2019t choke him.\u201d Southall and two other activists, including Carlos Havers of the National Action Network, entered the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Complex with tickets to Trump\u2019s rally after police outside the event moved their planned protest with a dozen other activists away from the entrance to the campaign event. The plan, Southall and Havers said, was to protest the rhetoric Trump engages in on the campaign trail \u2013 rhetoric that the two believe incited the violence they faced on Saturday. The many facial expressions of Donald Trump The 2016 rhetoric is getting out of hand \u201cWhen you have a candidate going around spewing hatred and racism, that\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Havers said of the physical altercation. \u201cHe was really inciting the entire thing.\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN on Saturday that \u201cthe campaign does not condone this behavior.\u201d She declined to elaborate on Trump\u2019s reaction to the confrontation. It is unlikely Trump could see the confrontation unfold from his vantage point on the stage, but was reacting to the apparent presence of protesters. Still, Southall and Havers said they hold Trump responsible for how they were treated at the campaign event. \u201cHe does condone it because he was the one saying, \u2018Yeah, get them out of here.\u2019 He was the one telling the supporters to do what they needed to to get them out of here,\u201d Havers said. \u201cWe want an apology from Donald Trump himself. We want him to sit down with us and explain why he did what he did and why\u2019s he\u2019s going around the country spewing hatred and racism.\u201d Clinton, Trump trade insults as rhetoric heats up between front-runners Southall said he intends to press charges against those who assaulted him at the event, and said the police officers who escorted him out of the event at no point asked him if he wished to do so. He also said they did not offer medical attention. \u201cThey were too busy trying to get me the f\u2014 out of there. They weren\u2019t trying to be nothing but just getting me the f\u2014 out of there. That was their whole concern,\u201d Southall said of the police officers who escorted him out of the event several minutes into the altercation between Southall and the half-dozen attendees. Birmingham Police Lt. Sean Edwards, the department\u2019s public information officer, told CNN on Saturday that Southall did not require medical attention and did not ask to press charges. 'Black lives matter' protests Ben Carson responds to Donald Trump\u2019s 95-minute tirade Edwards said the department tried to contact him later Saturday at several numbers but could not reach him. Edwards said his officers \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d the violent confrontation take place, but said Southall is welcome to file a police report and press charges. \u201cI would be a little cautious with Mercutio Southall,\u201d Edwards added. \u201cHe has been an agitator from day one. Mercutio is always the agitator.\u201d Speaking on the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly touted his strong relationship with minorities, from Hispanics to African-Americans \u2013 noting that he is assured victory in the general election if he can win the African-American vote. But Trump\u2019s controversial comments about racial and religious minorities \u2013 from Hispanics to, more recently, Muslims \u2013 have strained his relationship with people of color. Poll disputes Donald Trump claim on black voter support Trump kicked off his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d and lately has said he would either shut down or launch surveillance operations targeting mosques, and has appeared open to establishing a database for all Muslims in the U.S. Southall, a father to three sons, said he was disheartened by the experience and said he hoped publicity around the incident could help serve as a wake-up call in a country that he said has ignored racial divides for far too long. \u201cThis is the ugly truth of America. It was there like literally and figuratively in black and white. We saw it. We see it daily,\u201d Southall said. \u201cIt shows what kind of America we live in now and what kind of America it will be with Trump at the helm.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Service Employees International Union announced they were backing Hillary Clinton for president It's the most recent in a series of organized labor endorsements for Clinton's campaign Hillary Clinton won the endorsement of the nation\u2019s top service employee union on Tuesday, solidifying her lock on organized labor over Bernie Sanders, her top Democratic opponent in 2016. The International Executive Board of the Service Employees International Union met Tuesday in Washington, where they voted to extend their endorsement to Clinton. The executive body represents the almost 2 million workers represented by the union. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight \u201cHillary Clinton has proven she will fight, deliver and win for working families,\u201d SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement. \u201cSEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them. This movement for economic, racial, immigrant and social justice is poised to turn out to vote in November with their families and communities and keep pushing elected officials to deliver once in office.\u201d Hillary Clinton makes pro-union pitch to voters on Labor Day Clinton praised the SEIU\u2019s endorsement in a statement released by her campaign, saying she was \u201cdeeply honored.\u201d \u201cAs president, I will be proud to stand with SEIU and fight alongside them \u2013 to defend workers\u2019 right to organize and unions\u2019 right to bargain collectively, to raise incomes for working people and the middle class, and to ensure that hardworking Americans can retire with dignity and security,\u201d Clinton said. The endorsement comes far earlier in the Democratic nominating process than it did in 2008, when the union picked then-Sen. Barack Obama over Clinton in February of that year. Opinion: Bernie vs. Hillary: Who connects better with voters? The national endorsement is not binding to state and local SEIU chapters \u2013 a local chapter in New Hampshire, for example, endorsed Sanders earlier this month \u2013 but the national endorsement comes with more infrastructure, money and organization than the local backing. In order to make their decision, SEIU held a 1,200-member conference in March and conducted three national member polls from fall 2014 to fall 2015. Coupled with their endorsement, SEIU released a video touting their endorsement that features members describing why they support the former secretary of state. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates The SEIU endorsement comes less than a month after AFSCME, the largest trade union of public employees in the United States, endorsed Clinton and gives the Democratic front-runner a credible claim on having the bulk of organized labor behind her. The American Federation of Teachers, a group that has long supported Clinton, also backed the former secretary of state in July. Sanders has responded to the wealth of union endorsements by claiming that whole union leadership is with Clinton, it is the members on the ground that are behind him. \u201cBernie is proud to have the grassroots support of tens of thousands of working families in AFSCME and other unions,\u201d Sanders\u2019 spokesman Michael Briggs said in response to Clinton\u2019s endorsement last month.",

            "article_content": "Marlon Marshal is the highest-ranking African-American staffer on any presidential campaign He organized for Kerry in 2004, joined Clinton's campaign in 2007 and worked on both Obama campaigns When University of Missouri President Tim Wolfe resigned his post this week amid allegations of racial intolerance on campus, Marlon Marshall \u2013 Hillary Clinton\u2019s most senior black staffer \u2013 had to weigh in. On Twitter, he said that he was \u201cstanding with the students at Mizzou in my home state calling for change.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s account retweeted him. And Marshall, 36, also appeared with Mo Ivory, a popular cable TV personality who hosts a show on Howard University\u2019s radio station, to tell her more. \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m from St. Louis, so that hit home\u2026I\u2019m just glad that people got together, students stood up, made a statement for what they believed in,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThey made their voices heard, and for everything that\u2019s going on, we have to make sure their voices are heard in this process and as you see, when people ban together it can be a powerful message.\u201d Presidential candidates \u2014 including Clinton \u2014 have struggled at times this year with race issues, ranging from the fallout of Ferguson, to the church shooting in Charleston and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement. Marshall, whose official title is director of states and political engagement, is the highest-ranking African-American staffer on any presidential campaign. While his portfolio is broad, spanning the 50 states, one of his most important tasks is helping the Clinton campaign navigate a cultural and political terrain that includes a new and boisterous civil rights movement, viral racial incidents and the waning tenure of the nation\u2019s first black president. It was Marshall who Clinton reached out to the morning after nine African-Americans were gunned down in their Charleston church to say how upset she was and to ask how she could address the shooting in a way that could be meaningful. The resulting address, which he helped craft, functioned as Clinton\u2019s race speech, her boldest remarks on what she called America\u2019s \u201cdeep fault line.\u201d He has his hands in nearly every aspect of the operation; he is a longtime friend of Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cI don\u2019t make the policy but in thinking about how do we amplify African Americans in general, I am definitely at the table,\u201d he said in a CNN interview. \u201cSometimes too much.\u201d Saturday night in Iowa, Clinton will debate her opponents for the second time and the discussion will be centered on the economy and income inequality, issues that have stark racial components, a thread that has tripped up the field at various times.  Getting race right in the first post-Obama election \u2014 and connecting with the Obama coalition and \u201csurge voters\u201d while not alienating others \u2013 is crucial to winning the Democratic nomination and the White House.  According to exit poll data from 2012, African American voters were solely responsible for Obama\u2019s margin of victory in seven states, including Florida, Ohio and Nevada. Clinton has racked up endorsements from black elected officials across country, rolled out parts of a criminal justice platform, met with Black Lives Matters activists \u2013 who shouted her down in Atlanta recently \u2013 and pushed for expanding voting rights.  Marshall, who recently wrote a memo to supporters outlining Clinton\u2019s approach, is a veteran not only of Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, when she failed to connect with African-Americans, but also of both Obama campaigns \u2013 after Clinton lost, he was recruited to join Obama\u2019s team. \u201cHe is a cross between a motivational speaker, a reverend, a teddy bear and a targeting and data savant,\u201d said Buffy Wicks, who helped bring Marshall over to Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign after Clinton dropped out of the race and worked closely with him on Obama\u2019s re-election. \u201cThat means he is a bit of a unicorn.\u201d For Marshall, it all started freshman year at the University of Kansas, when a senior named Kevin Yoder asked him to join his ticket and run for a senate seat. They won, (Yoder is now a Republican congressman from Kansas), and Marshall later became student body vice president. His tenure then, mirrors what he does now. \u201cI put a focus on minority recruitment and retention and making sure that KU had an infrastructure in place to recruit and retain kids of color,\u201d he said. \u201cThat taught me a lot about organizing at the time.\u201d Marshall grew up in St. Louis, where his mother retired as a school teacher and his father worked as a custodian after a stint in the military. \u201cWith a mother, dad, two sisters, it was a strong woman household,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see what HRC did as first lady stood out to me when I was growing up.\u201d He organized for John Kerry in 2004, joined Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2007, and then worked on both Barack Obama campaigns. He also served as the national field director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2013 the first black person to hold that role. He joined the White House staff in September 2013. Clinton aides credit Marshall with helping to create a diverse campaign team at the state and upper staff level. Of Clinton\u2019s 511 staffers, nearly a third are people of color, matching national demographics. Among them are Tyrone Gayle, who directs regional press; LaDavia Drane, the black outreach director and Brynne Craig, the deputy political director. When Clinton held an event miles from Ferguson, Missouri, shortly after the Charleston shooting, Marshall helped organize it, drawing on his ties from growing up in St. Louis and from his fieldwork days. For him, Ferguson was personal. \u201cWatching your city burn on TV and tanks in our neighborhood and going home for that reason. It was real deep,\u201d said Marshall, who watched the coverage from his office near the White House. \u201cIt was almost as if I was dreaming. Like, is this really happening in this century?\u201d Other plugged in staffers help Marshall make sure the campaign is tuned in with what people are talking about. When, for instance, video surfaced of a South Carolina black high school student getting yanked from her chair by a school resource officer, a digital staffer flagged the incident and Marshall coordinated the campaign response. And ahead of a recent trip to South Carolina, Brynne Craig flagged a recent New York Times editorial by noted black feminist writer Roxanne Gay called \u201cWhere are Black Children Safe.\u201d Karen Finney, Clinton\u2019s strategic communications adviser and senior spokesperson, made sure the piece was on Clinton\u2019s radar.  On Thursday, Craig tweeted a photo of African-American staffers clad in black with the hashtag #InSolidarityWithMizzou.  Clinton\u2019s account later re-tweeted the image. \u201cFirst and foremost, Marlon is an African-American and I\u2019m an African-American and there are very many of us who are African-American on this campaign, this is the lived reality of African-Americans so we are always aware of it,\u201d said Craig, Clinton\u2019s deputy national political director. \u201cAs a campaign we do work to have these conversations; it\u2019s always on the forefront of our minds because they look like us and they could be our cousins or sisters or brothers.\u201d As a White House staffer, the one-time bartender and DJ helped sell two of Obama\u2019s legacy initiatives \u2013 the Affordable Care Act and My Brother\u2019s Keeper. His organizing experience came in handy as he wrangled stakeholders in targeted cities across the country to push the uninsured to enroll. The effort famously included Obama talking up health care on \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d Similarly, Clinton has expanded beyond traditional media to reach out to African-Americans. Last month, she appeared on \u201cAnother Round,\u201d a BuzzFeed podcast hosted by two black women who have big Twitter followings. In a recent memo to supporters, Marshall outlined Clinton\u2019s months-long efforts to energize black voters, who the campaign hopes will form the same Southern firewall that helped Obama win, effectively boxing out Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley. The memo came days after Clinton kicked off \u201cAfrican Americans for Hillary\u201d at Clark Atlanta University, an event that turned raucous after activists interrupted her speech. Flanked by Rep. John Lewis and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Clinton stood her ground, shouting over protestors who chanted \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d The crowd of 2,000 \u2013 mostly students \u2013 countered with \u201cLet her talk!\u201d  On Monday, in Chicago, she met with the mothers of slain African-Americans, a session in the works for months. \u201cWe have to have all the voices,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is a huge part of it and I love that they are raising these issues and using social media in a way that is really galvanizing people and looking at solutions.\u201d Activists are still waiting for Clinton to roll out a complete criminal justice platform\u2013Clinton has been releasing components of her plan, including \u201cbanning the box,\u201d eliminating the disparity between crack and powder cocaine and increasing federal oversight of police. Former colleagues recalled during the low points of campaigns \u2013 poor polling, bad press and bad debates \u2013 Marshall was the motivator and encourager, telling staffers to keep the big picture in mind. \u201cHe can bridge the Obama world and the Hillary Clinton world, the old and the young and the black, white, Latino, Asian constituency world,\u201d said Michael Blake, a New York Assemblyman who worked on Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. \u201cHe has the track record and the experience and the ability to bring in the right people to create a plan that makes sense. But it will be much harder than the Obama election, nobody has any illusions about that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "And as one of this state's most popular politicians, Tim Scott is poised to be a GOP kingmaker for the first-in-the-South presidential primary next year Almost 70% of Republicans view Scott favorably On the night he won his Senate race in 2014, South Carolina Republican Tim Scott got two congratulatory phone calls that his aides still recall. One call came from President Barack Obama and the other came from Jeb Bush. The two phone calls spotlight Scott\u2019s dual and still emerging role. As the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate from the South since the late 1800s, he is an historic figure, the new face of a changing region and party still grappling with race. And as one of this state\u2019s most popular politicians, Scott is poised to be a GOP kingmaker for the first-in-the-South presidential primary next year. \u201cHe is very popular at home,\u201d said fellow South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in a CNN interview. \u201cHe is a man of faith who appeals to the Chamber of Commerce and the tea party.\u201d A new Winthrop University poll shows that almost 70% of Republicans view him favorably. Graham, meanwhile, has a 46% approval rating. \u201cTim\u2019s Town Halls\u201d have given the Republican field a chance to court Scott, who has already hosted eight candidates, with six more scheduled. For his part, Graham, who is lagging badly in the polls, shouldn\u2019t expect any special favors from Scott, who has stopped short of saying that he will definitely endorse a candidate before the primary. \u201cNo head starts, it\u2019s a level playing field,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI hope to be in a position to endorse at some point. I am looking for the right candidate and the right message and the right timing to endorse.\u201d Scheduled for February 20, this state\u2019s primary has historically launched GOP candidates to the nomination\u2013Newt Gingrich in 2012 is the only candidate to win the primary and not win the nomination. The state has sometimes served as a tie-breaker, settling the on-going battle between the moderate and conservative wings of the party. In this cycle, South Carolina may also serve as a preview of the \u201cSEC primary\u201d on March 1, when as many as half a dozen southern states will go to the polls. \u201cIf you want to get it right, you have to impress these guys, South Carolina voters,\u201d Scott said. Impressing South Carolina voters is something that Scott himself will have to do again in November 2016 when his name will also appear on ballots for his first full term. While Scott enjoys high approval ratings now and wading into the presidential race is a chance to elevate his profile and flex some political muscle, voters and the GOP establishment can be fickle. Witness Gov. Nikki Haley. Once a tea party star, she became an embattled governor with low approval ratings whose backing of Mitt Romney in 2012 did little for her profile. She has since emerged as a possible ticket mate for the GOP nominee. Yet, she has been quietly tagged by some in her own party as political opportunist. Such is the nature of this state\u2019s politics. Appointed to the Senate in 2013 by Haley, and winning a special election the next year, Scott has built his political portfolio around poverty, education and body cameras for police officers. On a recent tour of his state, he visited a CVS store to access their apprenticeship program\u2013in 2014 he teamed with Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, to introduce the LEAP Act, a bill that would increase apprenticeships. Yet, race is also a part of his portfolio. In the wake of the shooting deaths of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church, Scott choked up on the Senate floor as he recalled the horror. When Haley called for the removal of the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds, she cited Scott\u2019s election as proof of changing times in the state\u2019s \u201ctough history\u201d on matters of race. Rep. Trey Gowdy, who is Scott\u2019s best friend in Congress said from time to time, the racial divide comes up. \u201cI asked him once, have you ever been stopped in a circumstance when you thought you weren\u2019t doing anything wrong. He goes, \u2018all the time,\u2019\u201d Gowdy, who co-hosts the presidential town halls with Scott, said. \u201cI never had to live with that. I don\u2019t know what that feels like. Nobody has ever stopped me walking into the Capitol, making sure I was credentialed. If there is a bitterness about it, he keeps it incredibly well concealed.\u201d Next week, Scott will host former New York Gov. George Pataki and on October 24, he will host a town hall with Bush. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Tim Scott playing kingmaker. If you know him, he is willing to make everyone else the star,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cKingmaker would be the antithesis of what Tim Scott is. There is not a self-promoting bone in his body.\u201d Indeed, even as Scott is at the center of political world in his home state, he is already eyeing the exit. \u201cMy personal journey at some point heads towards the ministry, not towards the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cMy future isn\u2019t stuck in politics.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Stephen Breyer discussed his surprise call for the U.S. to reassess the death penalty But he would not weigh into other political issues that might go before the Court Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer helped a split majority create a new right for same-sex couples to marry, but he\u2019s not about to weigh in on Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who defied the Court\u2019s landmark decision and spent five nights in jail rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \u201cI am evading the question,\u201d Breyer told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer regarding Kim Davis, the Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk who said that issuing same sex marriage licenses under the landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges would violate her religious freedom. \u201cWhat is settled law, is what we wrote,\u201d he said, noting Davis\u2019 objections could find their way to the Supreme Court. \u201cHow these issues play out on the margins is something I don\u2019t yet know, but I know there\u2019s a chance it might come up in various ways,\u201d he said. Same-sex marriage at SCOTUS in less than two minutes The 77-year-old, who just marked his 21st anniversary on the Court, sat down for a wide-ranging interview regarding the controversies of last term, including his votes in favor of same sex marriage and Obamacare, as well as a surprising dissent he issued in a death penalty case. Breyer is promoting his third book, \u201cThe Court and the World, American Law and the New Global Realities,\u201d which delves into current and past cases to bolster his argument that the Supreme Court must increasingly consider the world outside U.S. borders in its own work. The Davis controversy is occurring as the presidential debate heats up and candidates on both sides of the spectrum have taken aim at the Court and some of its decisions. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has said that the Court overstepped its boundaries in the Obergefell decision, Hillary Clinton is pushing for a reversal of Citizens United, and Donald Trump has said he advocates amending the Constitution to do away with granting automatic citizenship to all children born in the U.S. On the eve of a presidential debate, Breyer was likewise very wary of wading into presidential politics. Huckabee calls for term limits on Supreme Court \u201cEveryone has freedom of speech,\u201d he allowed. \u201cBut judges, do they have freedom of speech? They have to be very, very, very careful when they make a remark that could be interpreted politically.\u201d But Breyer stressed that controversy surrounding the highest court in the land is nothing new. \u201cThere have been plenty of times in history where the Court has been the subject of very strong criticism,\u201d he said referring to cases such as Bush v. Gore, that decided the 2000 election and Brown V. Board of Education , the 1954 holding that racial segregation of children in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause. U.S. reacts to same-sex marriage ruling \u201cYou try to do your best,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do your best to have some of what I call \u2018imaginative understanding\u2019 of how a decision will affect people in this country, because this is not a theoretical exercise. This is an exercise that affects Americans all across the country.\u201d In June, while most people were watching the cases concerning gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act, Breyer jolted court watchers in another case. In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld the use of the lethal injection drug, midazolam.  In his dissent, Breyer did something he has never done before. Joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, he said that he thought the Court should revisit the constitutionality of the death penalty. Currently no sitting justice has said the death penalty is unconstitutional. Actress, activist speak out against the death penalty Breyer reiterated his concerns about the punishment\u2019s reliability, and his belief that it is being arbitrarily imposed. \u201cI think, it\u2019s time to revisit the issue,\u201d he said. The lethal injection case came out on the last day of the term, and Breyer took the summer to travel and recuperate during the annual recess. He is now tackling a book tour before the next term commences in October. In the book, Breyer suggests that because the world is now so interdependent, the Supreme Court is increasingly considering complex cases on issues such as national security, securities law human rights and copyright, that involve other countries and their laws and customs. He writes that the Court must \u201cextend its range of legal and practical reference beyond what has been its custom, in order to arrive at sound judgment.\u201d Is America's death penalty in its dying days? The Court\u2019s reference to foreign law, in some circumstances, has prompted criticism at times from Justice Antonin Scalia and members of Congress. RELATED: Supreme Court backs use of lethal injection drug In the book, Breyer acknowledges the criticism. \u201cI do not ignore the basic fact that the American people can and must democratically determine their own laws,\u201d he writes. But the act of listening to those who understand the relevant foreign law is \u201cperfectly consistent\u201d with the interpretation of our own law, he adds. Breyer told Blitzer that the world has changed. \u201cAnd if we do not participate through even institutions like the Supreme Court, the world will go along without us and we will have a world that has a less humane, decent rule of law than we advocate here in the United States.\u201d In between controversial decisions, book tours and speaking engagements, Breyer shows no signs of slowing down. \u201cI give my best to it, each time I decide a case,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you get older, it\u2019s even more of a benefit.\u201d And he is proud of the way the Court handles its divisions in the closely divided cases. He said his colleagues don\u2019t share a \u201cslap on the back, let\u2019s go out for a drink\u201d type of friendship. But they are friends and they do socialize. More importantly Breyer said, \u201cI have never, in 21 years, heard in that conference room a voice raised in anger.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson other branches might learn. \u201cThere\u2019s no reasons we\u2019 can\u2019t be friends,\u201d he said \u201cthere\u2019s no reason that human beings cannot differ civilly \u2013 civilly \u2013 on matters of great importance.\u201d",

            "article_content": "South Carolina, where African-Americans will make up a majority of primary voters, is proving to be a challenge for Sanders Sanders has had awkward encounters with protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement Bernie Sanders\u2019 first event in his second swing through this crucial state was unlike anything his campaign has seen before. His crowd was small. It was mostly black. And prominent academic Cornel West introduced him as \u201cbrother Bernie Sanders.\u201d Buoyed by recent polls showing him closing in on Hillary Clinton in national surveys, and leading in New Hampshire and Iowa, Sanders came to this city to confront a major challenge of his campaign: black voters still don\u2019t really know who he is. So Saturday morning, he appeared at Benedict College, a historically black college and a frequent campaign stop for any presidential candidate courting black voters. In many ways, it was a soft launch for the Sanders campaign, as aides eschewed prominent signage and logos on stage and went with a simple backdrop of an American flag and South Carolina\u2019s state flag. But West, one of President Barack Obama\u2019s fiercest progressive critics and now Sanders\u2019 most prominent black surrogate, brought excited and enthusiastic young African-Americans. \u201cDear brother Bernie Sanders, he is not just on the move, he is going to win,\u201d West said, adding later that Sanders is \u201ca brother of integrity and honesty.\u201d The latest CNN/ORC poll shows Sanders lagging Clinton by just 10 points nationally, as speculation about a possible late entry by Vice President Joe Biden has hurt the former secretary of state and helped vault the Vermont senator to second place. According to recent state polls, Sanders has managed to close in on Clinton in Iowa and has overtaken her in New Hampshire, a state that shares a media market and a demographic make-up with Sanders\u2019 home state. But South Carolina, where African-Americans will make up a majority of primary voters, is proving to be much more of a challenge for Sanders, who has cultivated a persona of a curmudgeonly populist, railing against oligarchs in a thick Brooklynese. Sanders\u2019 town hall event here on Saturday drew about 1,000 people, but roughly half were white, a sign of where Sanders draws much of his support so far. Among his biggest applause lines were when he mentioned the names of Sandra Bland, Walter Scott and Eric Garner, African-Americans who died while in police custody. And he said racism wasn\u2019t just about incidents like the shooting deaths of nine blacks in a Charleston church. \u201cRacism remains alive today, and our goal together must be to end all forms of institutional racism and make major reforms in our criminal justice system,\u201d he said. Sanders\u2019 enthusiastic crowds and cult of personality have drawn comparisons to Obama, but it\u2019s Clinton who has devised a campaign strategy that mirrors Obama\u2019s. Like Obama, Clinton is betting on a southern firewall that has carried other Democrats to victory, including Bill Clinton. It\u2019s a plan largely built on the turnout of African-American voters \u2013 particularly black women \u2013 who will make up the majority of primary voters in states like Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. In this scenario, South Carolina, which holds its primary on February 27, would effectively serve as a domino for Clinton, fueling momentum in other southern primaries on March 1. On a multi-state strategy winding through the South, Sanders is playing catch-up and his aides admit that time remains the biggest challenge. While Clinton has racked up endorsements from elected officials, like Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, Sanders has been slow to get establishment support, though he has gotten some backing, particularly from big labor organizers. On the staffing level, at least in this state, Sanders has drawn even with Clinton. Her campaign has 14 full-time staffers on the ground with two field offices; Sanders has 15 full-time staffers and two offices. Clinton has visited this state three times; Sanders has now made two visits. On his first visit, a total of 10,000 people came to see him, though the vast majority of those in the audiences were white and many were college-aged. Sanders met privately with African-American leaders on his first visit and plans similar meetings this weekend, with West in tow. Aides said that West, who once called Obama a \u201cRockefeller Republican in blackface,\u201d could legitimize some of Sanders\u2019 conversations with African-American voters. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the message is not resonating with the African-American community, it\u2019s that we haven\u2019t communicated with them yet,\u201d said Chris Covert, the South Carolina state director for Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe have been busy building our organization and making sure that we have enough people on the ground to have those conversations.\u201d Sanders, who hails from the second whitest state in the country, has had awkward encounters with protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, who criticized him for focusing almost exclusively on class while ignoring the racial components of inequality. The confrontations prompted him to bring on more black staffers, including Symone Sanders, who introduces him at many events and typically mentions racial gaps in the criminal justice system in her remarks. Sanders is working on criminal justice reform legislation that targets private prisons and would reinstate the federal parole system. Such moves, along with his support for free college tuition, single-payer health care and a $15-an-hour minimum wage, put him to the left of Clinton, yet it could be too far left for Southerners. \u201cThe south is the most conservative and religious region of the country and that tends to be true for the subgroups as well. The label socialist is not going to be one that\u2019s very attractive across the board,\u201d said Nicol Rae, who wrote the book \u201cSouthern Democrats.\u201d \u201cFor the hardcore white liberal voters, it doesn\u2019t bother them and he is a fairly moderate socialist, but I don\u2019t see it as a net plus.\u201d Polls show that Sanders does well with voters under 35, while Clinton does well with voters over 55 \u2013 in his introduction, West suggested that Sanders would win the election if only young people voted and the election were held today. \u201cIn the name of John Coltrane,\u201d West said, \u201cyou got to get in on the love train.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Black Lives Matter movement is roiling the presidential race, forcing candidates to grapple with the thorny issue of racial inequality as the Democratic campaign tightens and the Republican primary is wide-open. In Iowa, activists heckled Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker this week. In Nevada, a group of multi-racial protestors recently disrupted Jeb Bush, sparking a counter \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d chant. Who's running for President? And Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton faced a group of activists during a sometimes tense meeting in New Hampshire that was captured on video and released late Monday. The activists are emerging as a wild card on the 2016 presidential stump, popping up at rallies and town halls, threatening to derail  carefully crafted events and forcing scripted candidates off their talking points. But perhaps the biggest question surrounding the movement is whether it will influence the political process without becoming part of it. Rather that throw its support behind one candidate or another, movement leaders say they plan to keep the pressure on everyone. \u201cThere is no support for any of the candidates. Each candidate should expect to be held accountable. That is our political position in this current election cycle,\u201d said Elle Hearns, strategic partner in Black Lives Matter movement, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera. \u201cOne of things they can do is expect to be held accountable and to be receptive to that accountability.\u201d READ: Inside the Clinton, Black Lives Matter meeting 'Black lives matter' protests While their tactics have been questioned \u2013 comedian Larry Wilmore said that black lives matter but black manners do too \u2013 the results are hard to argue with. Already, they have met with the top three Democratic candidates to talk about criminal justice reform and other issues. But Clinton\u2019s recent engagement with the activists highlights how difficult it will be for any politician to find common cause with the sprawling and still-evolving movement. One major point of contention between Clinton and the decentralized Black Lives Matter movement is Bill Clinton\u2019s 1994 crime bill, which led to a massive uptick in the prison population, disproportionately jailing African-Americans. In her first major policy speech, Clinton acknowledged that the bill, sponsored by then-Sen. Joe Biden and backed by the majority of the Congressional Black Caucus, went too far, and she vowed to end the \u201cera of mass incarceration.\u201d Bill Clinton has also said that the bill \u201ccast too wide a net,\u201d and that his administration got it wrong on sentencing provisions. In the videotaped face-to-face meeting with Hillary Clinton, Black Lives Matter activists didn\u2019t want to hear about her policy ideas. Instead, they sought a personal reflection on how she felt about the human toll of so many African-Americans being locked up as a result of policies she advocated. \u201cHer policy response \u2013 if it\u2019s not addressing the anti-blackness inherent in some of the previous policies \u2013 then we are just going to see that thread continue,\u201d Daunasia Yancey, founder of Black Lives Matter in Boston, said on CNN\u2019s Wolf. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we were looking to hear \u2013 what\u2019s shifted, what\u2019s changed for Hillary Clinton that\u2019s going to make us believe that she can take us in a different direction in terms of race.\u201d Galvanized by the death of Trayvon Martin at the hands of George Zimmerman, the group of activists have largely rejected the kind of top-down leadership that has defined most social movements.  While the need for criminal justice reform animates their cause, they are also for pushing for a broad change in how African Americans are viewed and treated. Writing in The Washington Post, Patrisse Cullors, said Democrats have, \u201cmilked the Black vote while creating policies that completely decimate Black communities.\u201d \u201cNo presidential candidate has ever centered their agenda around the worth of Black lives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are committed to redefining our worth as Black people and holding our country\u2019s representatives accountable.\u201d READ: Can Bernie Sanders win black voters? In her meeting with activists, Clinton pressed them for a more concrete focus. \u201cWe need a whole comprehensive plan \u2014 that I am more than happy to work with you guys on \u2014 to try to figure out, okay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know Black lives matter. We need to keep saying it so that people accept it. What do we do next? What is our step?\u201d Clinton has yet to roll out a comprehensive plan on criminal justice reform, despite moves from her Democratic competitors. Martin O\u2019Malley unveiled his plan last month while Bernie Sanders released a racial justice platform. He\u2019s set to meet with activists soon. \u201cFolks are ready to discuss policy,\u201d tweeted DeRay Mckesson in an exchange with Sanders. The visibility of the Black Lives Matter movement comes as President Barack Obama has spoken out more on race. So far, Obama has been spared the kind of public disruptions seen on the campaign trail this summer and has met with activists at the White House. Still, there is some discontent with Obama\u2019s failure to embrace the language of the movement. \u201cThere is a level of disconnect that this current administration has,\u201d said Elle Hearns, strategic partner in the Black Lives Matter movement in an interview with Cabrera. \u201cThey also haven\u2019t declared that black lives matter either so that\u2019s something that the current administration could also do. We haven\u2019t seen that from them either.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders has attracted about 100,000 people to his rallies since July Author: Sanders 'is now a messiah on the left' The summer of Sanders is heating up. In just the past week, 28,000 people showed up to see Bernie Sanders in Portland, Oregon, including about 9,000 people who were content to watch the Vermont senator on giant screens in the overflow area. Another 28,000 people joined him in Los Angeles. All told, Sanders has brought his wonky brand of populism to 100,000 people at rallies and other events since July, easily outpacing Hillary Clinton, spurring comparisons to President Barack Obama\u2019s grass-roots appeal and even earning a few superlatives from Donald Trump. Who's running for President? \u201cYou know what? He\u2019s getting the biggest crowds,\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, said this week in Michigan. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones getting the crowds.\u201d The droves of people packing arenas from Maine to Washington state to hear from a cantankerous 73-year-old senator who identifies as a democratic socialist reflect Sanders\u2019 unique ability to tap into the energy \u2013 and anxiety \u2013 of the left this election season. With his speeches bemoaning the power of Wall Street and entrenched politics, Sanders is becoming the undisputed front man for the liberal movement that aims to upend the status quo. \u201cHe is now a messiah on the left,\u201d said Greg Guma, who wrote \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic: Vermont and the Sanders Revolution,\u201d and has known Sanders since the 1970s. \u201cHe will upset the apple cart.\u201d His impact on the race is becoming more acute.  A Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll this week found that Sanders is overtaking Clinton in New Hampshire, winning the support of 44% of voters compared to 37% for the former secretary of state. The findings aren\u2019t entirely surprising considering Sanders represents neighboring Vermont in the Senate. Still, they could give Clinton\u2019s camp pause at a time when she is also grappling with a host of other negative headlines related to her email scandal and polling that indicates the public doesn\u2019t trust her. A CNN/ORC Poll of Democratic voters in Iowa released on Wednesday found Clinton remains dominant there, though Sanders is showing some areas of strength. Sanders outpaces Clinton when Democratic caucusgoers are asked who is more honest and the gap is narrowing when it comes to who would better handle the economy, though Clinton still has the advantage on that issue. Sanders\u2019 massive crowds and growing momentum stand in stark contrast to Clinton\u2019s more low-key events and her summer full of campaign stumbles and email controversies. While the self-described democratic socialist may once have been seen as a long-shot contender, he is now seen as a credible alternative to Clinton by some liberals. \u201cIt seems like Bernie is representing the counterculture views,\u201d said Michael Glenn, who has never voted but showed up at a rally for Sanders in Portland. \u201cI think he represents a lot of the people who are kind of looking beyond Democrat or Republican.\u201d READ: Poll: Most want criminal probe for Clinton emails He is also drawing nontraditional voters, suggesting he could either expand the party or simply become a political curiosity like Howard Dean and flame out for lack of deep support. At his events, die-hard progressives waving handmade signs about climate change and Arctic drilling mingle with veterans and people wearing National Rifle Association T-shirts. Glenn, his long beard matching his even longer brown hair, said he approached politics from a \u201cno party perspective\u201d and that when he looks at the 2016 candidates, Sanders is the most obvious candidate for someone like him. Sanders\u2019 candidacy is highlighting fissures among Democrats. He counts unions among his biggest campaign backers, underscoring his role as a class warrior battling for the little guy. But his massive crowds are predominantly white. \u201cThe Bernie voter is the Bill Maher viewer who is a little on the cynical side,\u201d said University of Vermont political science professor Garrison Nelson, who has known Sanders for years. \u201cThis is a chance to put a thumb in the eye of the establishment.\u201d His campaign has become the most visible vehicle for the Occupy Wall Street movement, a group of activists who openly challenged Democratic leaders over their kid-glove approach to Wall Street. And they are rabid on social media, going after detractors and amplifying Sanders\u2019 message.  His debate-night tweet slamming Republicans as \u201cout of touch\u201d was retweeted 33,000 times, the most of any other candidate. Supporters say they are drawn to his authenticity and plain talk. \u201cYou trust that he\u2019s telling you the truth,\u201d said Claire Met, an Oregon native who came to the Portland event with three friends. Sporting a Sanders T-shirt, as well as a half-dozen Sanders buttons, Met said, \u201cYou can trust that he\u2019s not going to change his mind once he gets into office. And if he does change his mind there\u2019s going to be a darn good reason for it.\u201d Brian Foren, a father who brought his young son Liam to a Seattle event, echoed Met, but added a concern. \u201cI worry that he\u2019s confused for being loony by being so honest. It shocks Americans,\u201d he said. Sanders has largely failed to catch on among African-American and Latino voters. One event over the weekend was disrupted by protests from leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement. Clinton\u2019s prospects are bolstered by a firewall of African-American voters in Southern and big swing states.  According to a recent Gallup Poll, 80% of African-Americans view Clinton favorably, with just 23% viewing Sanders the same way.  Only 33% of African-Americans are even familiar with the Vermont senator, a metric the Sanders campaign has tried to improve. After a group of Black Lives Matter protesters shut him down at a Seattle rally, Sanders released a racial justice platform and announced the hire of Symone Sanders, a black staffer who will serve as campaign press secretary. She has introduced Sanders at several rallies, hugging him as he approaches the podium. Later this month, he will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, an early test of how well he can play on what should be Clinton\u2019s turf. The Clinton campaign has largely avoided criticizing Sanders and Sanders has returned the favor. When he was asked recently about whether voters should question Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness, Sanders said he admired Clinton, pointed  out their differences and also pivoted to identity politics. \u201cHillary Clinton has been under all kinds of attack for many, many years. In fact, I can\u2019t think of many personalities who have been attacked for more reasons than Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cAnd, by the way, let me be frank. And I\u2019m running against her. Some of it is sexist. I don\u2019t know that a man would be treated the same way that Hillary is.\u201d READ: Clinton explains why she went to Trump wedding For Sanders, converting a summer fling into something more lasting will require transforming his buzzy appeal and big crowds to electoral wins in big states.  Allies of Clinton concede he will likely win a handful of states, as no Democratic nominee in modern history who wasn\u2019t a sitting vice president has managed a clean sweep. While he is unlikely to go negative against Clinton or other Democrats, his brash populism will infuse the nomination fight, adding energy as well as unpredictability to a race that some had thought would be a coronation. \u201cHe is more polite than Trump, but there is a similarity there, it\u2019s a New York thing and an alpha male thing,\u201d Guma said.  \u201cBernie is a Democrat with guts.\u201d Henderson reported from Washington while Merica reported from Portland.",

Bernie Sanders drew more than 19,000 people to an NBA arena on Sunday night in Portland, Oregon, setting the record for the largest political event of the 2016 presidential contest. The Democratic candidate has drawn large crowds nearly everywhere he has gone, so much so that Sanders\u2019 campaign has started to be defined by their turnout figures. Sanders\u2019 staff has also proudly touted the numbers as proof that their campaign is catching fire nationally, though Sanders\u2019 largest rallies have typically been in liberal enclaves such as Madison, Wisconsin, and Sunday\u2019s Pacific Northwest events fit that description. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Sanders said as he walked on stage in Portland. \u201cThis is an unbelievable turnout.\u201d According to Michael Lewellen, vice president of corporate communications for the arena, there were over 19,000 people in the arena and an estimated 9,000 people who lined up outside but were unable to get in. Lewellen said a total of 28,000 people tried to attend the event. A few minutes until Bernie Sanders' event in Portland starts and the 19,000 person Moda Center is nearly filled. pic.twitter.com/iOPYUHyqu7 Of late, the Sanders campaign has been dogged by Black Lives Matter protestors. The senator\u2019s first event Saturday in Seattle was ended after two protestors stormed the stage and refused to leave. And on Sunday night it was clear that the campaign remains worried about protests, despite trying to address what has been a nagging blind spot for the senator. Sanders\u2019 aides said before the event that they were planning for a \u201cdisturbance\u201d from Black Lives Matters protestors. The senator\u2019s new press secretary, Symone Sanders, told the audience that if a protest were to break out, the audience should chant \u201cWe Stand Together.\u201d The arena broke out into the chant after Sanders said it. This is the first time Sanders\u2019 campaign has rolled out a shout down chant for dealing with protests and was a clear attempt to avoid what happened Saturday, when Sanders supporters booed the Black Lives Matters protestors. Who's running for President? RELATED: Black Lives Matter protesters shut down Sanders event in Seattle Sanders told the audience that his campaign was about \u201cbringing people together,\u201d not dividing voters. And as he did on Saturday night in Seattle, he spoke about issues that Black Lives Matter wants to hear more about: criminal justice, education and prison reform. Three women gained access to the press area on Sunday night and held a banner that read \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot PDX,\u201d an abbreviation for Portland. When Sanders wasn\u2019t speaking, attendees could hear the women chanting faintly, but the protest did not serve as much of a disruption and the arena did not break out into chants. After the event, Sanders told CNN that he wasn\u2019t worry about protests. \u201cGreat night. Huge turnout. Very good,\u201d he said as he worked the ropeline. One new addition to Sunday\u2019s event: Security. Six guards stood around the stage on the floor of the Moda Arena, ensuring that if a protest were to break out, it would be unlikely the stage would be seized. Sanders\u2019 campaign declined to talk about security after Saturday\u2019s protest, but the senator has yet to travel with a visible security detail. Since protestors first hit a Sanders event in July, the campaign has tried to address the candidate\u2019s issues with Black Lives Matters protestors. After Saturday\u2019s protests the campaign added a \u201cRacial Justice\u201d tab to their campaign issues page. \u201cWe must pursue policies that transform this country into a nation that affirms the value of its people of color. That starts with addressing the four central types of violence waged against black and brown Americans: physical, political, legal and economic,\u201d the website reads. RELATED: Bernie Sanders says criticism of Hillary Clinton is \u2018sexist\u2019 The audience at Sunday\u2019s event was primarily white and expressed a lot of anti-Clinton sentiment. \u201cHe listens I think more than she does,\u201d said Claire Met, who came out with three friends to attend the event. \u201cShe seems more out of touch.\u201d Grace Rubenstein, a 19-year old from Oregon, said she respected Clinton but felt it was \u201ctime for new opinions to be brought into the race.\u201d And Brian Foren, who brought his son Liam to the event, said he was backing Sanders because he was concerned Clinton\u2019s \u201cbaggage\u201d would hurt her in the general election. \u201cI appreciate his honestness and his frankness,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a lot of baggage and I worry that her baggage might cost us the election.\u201d As for Liam, he said he is supporting Sanders because \u201cmommy and daddy told me.\u201d",

Politics is personal,\" she said South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley spoke at length Thursday on the lessons she learned from the high profile Confederate flag battle in her state earlier this summer, saying Republicans need to get better at listening. Just hours before the GOP presidential debate in Cleveland, Haley, who\u2019s considered a potential vice presidential contender, addressed an influential group of Republicans down the street at the Republican National Committee\u2019s summer meeting. In an onstage exchange with RNC chairman Reince Priebus, Haley said it\u2019s \u201ceasy to be divisive\u201d in politics but argued \u201cit\u2019s courageous to put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes.\u201d \u201cYou learn to think like them. You learn what they feel. Politics is personal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in order for us to get people to understand where we\u2019re coming from, we have to see where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d Following the Charleston church shooting that left nine black parishioners dead at the hand of a white shooter, Haley joined a chorus of cries to remove the Confederate flag from the state\u2019s capitol grounds and helped lead Republicans to rally behind the effort. RELATED: Haley seizes the political moment amid Confederate flag debate The push faced opposition from those who defended the flag as a memorial to ancestors lost in the Civil War who fought for the Confederacy, but Haley said \u201cwhat they also found out was the hurt and pain\u201d associated with the flag. Governor chokes up over Charleston shooting \u201cThe lesson that I hope we as Republicans learn is that we are perceived as very hard and cold, and we know we\u2019re not, but how are we showing that? The best way for us to show it is to listen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I took, is we need to listen more.\u201d The Republican Party has stepped up its minority voter outreach since Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, when he won only 6% of the African-American vote and 27% of the Hispanic vote. Focusing on issues like poverty, criminal justice reform, and racial tension, Republicans have tried to broaden their base. But Democrats repeatedly point back to issues like voter ID laws passed by Republican legislatures and governors that critics say disproportionately affect minority communities. Thursday marked the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, and Democrats used the occasion to blast Republicans over their support for laws requiring an ID to vote. Proponents of those laws, however, argue that they prevent fraud. Haley said after the flag was taken down, reporters started asking her whether she thought such laws were racist. \u201cI don\u2019t think voter ID is racist. I never have,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I do think is everybody deserves to prove who they are. And if we have to show ID to get Sudafed, if we have to show an ID to get on a plane, I want everyone to have that right to be able to show an ID to do the one thing we value, which is to vote.\u201d",

            "article_content": "When the two presidential candidates address the National Urban League on Friday, they'll likely bring different messages The conference comes after a year of growing racial tension Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton come from the highest political pedigree in the United States. And despite the battles their two families have fought against each other, members of the Clintons and the Bushes have formed inextricable bonds. But politics is politics, so when Clinton took the stage on Friday at the National Urban League conference in Fort Lauderdale - just minutes before Bush would address the same audience \u2013 the former secretary of state leveled some of her most direct attacks against the former Florida governor. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can credibly say that everyone has a right to rise and then say you are for phasing out Medicare and repealing Obamacare,\u201d Clinton said, using Bush\u2019s \u201cRight to Rise\u201d super PAC name to indirectly \u2013 but clearly \u2013 hit the 2016 Republican candidate. \u201cThey can\u2019t rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote.\u201d Bush did not respond to Clinton\u2019s comments when he took the same stage later Friday morning, only saying he was \u201cpleased\u201d to see the other candidates at the event and mentioned them all by name, including Clinton. Spokesman Tim Miller, however, took Twitter to blast Clinton\u2019s remarks. \u201cClintonesque move to pass over chance to unite in favor of a false cheap shot. When you have no record of accomplishment to point to,\u201d he wrote. In her speech, Clinton cast herself a someone who has fought along side the Urban League for decades, not just someone who speaks at their conference and tells them what they want to hear. \u201cThe real test of a candidates\u2019 commitment is not whether we come to speak,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cit is whether we are still around after the cameras are gone and the votes are counted. It is whether our positions live up to our rhetoric and too often we see a mismatch between what some candidates say in venues like this and what they actually do when they are elected.\u201d Clinton did not use Bush\u2019s name, but the lines were clear and some of the starkest attacks the former first lady has leveled against the former Florida governor. The lines underscore Clinton and Bush\u2019s different presidential platforms, particularly the way the candidates are positioning themselves with African American voters. Friday\u2019s scene is rare: Clinton and Bush are among the guests speaking at the conference, where a select group of Republican and Democratic candidates make their pitch for president before a predominately African-American crowd. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a Republican, along with Democratic candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley are also set to appear. RELATED: No apology necessary for \u2018all lives matter,\u2019 Jeb Bush says But all eyes are on Clinton and Bush, both of whom are running at or near the top of their fields for their respective party\u2019s nomination. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ll speak at the same event since announcing their White House bids. Jeb Bush: No apology necessary for 'all lives matter' The conference comes after a year of growing racial tension that has exploded into an emotional debate over the separate killings of black Americans at the hands of white police officers. That conflict has seen fresh attention after the death of a black woman, Sandra Bland, in a Texas jail after a traffic violation. Officials ruled the death a suicide. Also in recent memory: The massacre of nine parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina, by a white male who told authorities he wanted to \u201cshoot black people.\u201d The tragedy sparked a passionate, bipartisan effort to have the Confederate Flag removed from state capitol grounds in Columbia, South Carolina. Encapsulating their message in the slogan \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d activists have sought to bring racial injustice to the forefront of the presidential debate, forcing politicians from both parties to face questions about how they would remedy racial disparities in the criminal justice system. It\u2019s been a difficult issue to navigate for many of the candidates. Confronted by activists in June, O\u2019Malley responded: \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\u201d  He later apologized, saying he did not \u201cmean to be insensitive\u201d to the \u201cdepth of feeling that all of us should be attaching to this issue.\u201d Bush, however, defended O\u2019Malley, arguing that the Democratic candidate shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for saying \u201call lives matter.\u201d \u201cI know in the political context it\u2019s a slogan, and should he have apologized? No. If he believes that white lives matter, which I hope he does, then he shouldn\u2019t apologize to a group that seemed to disagree with it,\u201d he said in New Hampshire last week. Clinton had her own \u201cblack lives matter\u201d misstep when she told an audience just miles from Ferguson, Missouri - where the shooting of Michael Brown sparked sustained protests \u2013 that \u201call lives matter.\u201d Since then, and with the benefit of watching her opponents stumble, Clinton has used the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d repeatedly. O'Malley apologizes for offense \u201cThis is not just a slogan,\u201d Clinton said of the phrase during a campaign stop in South Carolina. \u201cThis should be a guiding principle.\u201d Clinton also mentioned black lives matter in her Friday speech and outlined why, in her opinion, race still holds back African Americans in the United States. \u201cRace still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind,\u201d she said. Clinton \u2013 and her campaign aides who see the pathway to electoral victory through the Obama coalition \u2013 have made reaching out to African American voters an integral part of the campaign. RELATED: Democrats lose control of presidential event Her first speech as a candidate was on police reform, where she called for mandatory police body cameras across the nation.  And after the Charleston shooting, Clinton said that the United States\u2019 struggle with racism is \u201cfar from finished.\u201d \u201cI know this is a difficult topic to talk about,\u201d Clinton said earlier this year in San Francisco. \u201cI know that so many of us hoped by electing our first black President we had turned the page on this chapter in our history. I know there are truths we don\u2019t like to say out loud in discussions with our children, but we have to. That is the only way we can possibly move forward together.\u201d Clinton\u2019s team has also engaged the activists behind Black Lives Matter. After the death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year old boy who was shot by police in Cleveland, LaDavia Drane, Clinton\u2019s African-American outreach director, had one-on-one meetings and group listening sessions with individuals involved in the Cleveland for the Movement for Black Lives. While Bush hasn\u2019t waded as far into the debate, he was asked earlier this week by a reporter why there\u2019ve been so many questions or examples lately of police brutality. Shaking his head, he said he didn\u2019t know. \u201cMaybe this has been going on a long while, but now because we capture everything in the digital world, perhaps that\u2019s the reason that there\u2019s been a larger number of these things,\u201d he said. Bush added there \u201cought to be some consideration of \u2026 expanding cameras (and) certainly more training,\u201d but he also argued there needs \u201cto be a recognition that being a police officer is a dangerous job. And they get it right a lot of times, too.\u201d More broadly on racial inequality, Bush has pledged to campaign in urban areas and push a message that Republicans have the right policies to bring people out of poverty. Following Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential loss \u2013 in which he carried only 6% of the black vote \u2013 Republicans have stepped up their efforts to court minority voters. Bush is among a small slew of 2016 candidates who have portrayed themselves as White House hopefuls able to woo nontraditional Republican voters. Democratic presidential candidates under pressure at liberal event Education reform \u2013 a big issue for minority communities \u2013 was the overriding theme of Bush\u2019s speech on Friday. He pointed to opening the first charter school in Florida and other reforms that promoted school choice, saying the country\u2019s education disparity is \u201cthe worst inequality in America and the source of so many other inequalities.\u201d \u201cI believe in the right to rise in this country.  And a child is not rising if he\u2019s not reading.\u201d On criminal justice, Bush said his administration expanded drug courts and prevention programs, and he signed an executive order to promote the hiring of ex-offenders. \u201cI took the view \u2013 as I would as president \u2013 that real justice in America has got to include restorative justice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this country, we shouldn\u2019t be writing people off, denying them a second chance at a life of meaning.\u201d He also pointed to what he called the \u201cbreakdown of fatherhood in America,\u201d saying government should \u201cexert the positive societal pressures that can turn the tide.\u201d He cited his work to double the collection of child support to 90% as governor. Bush said it\u2019s easy to see why there\u2019s disillusionment when \u201ctrust in our vital institutions is at historic lows,\u201d adding that it\u2019s \u201cup to all of us to work diligently to rebuild that trust.\u201d \u201cOne politician at a time. One police officer at a time. One community leader at a time,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt begins with respect, dialogue, and the courage to reach out in peace.\u201d He also recalled moving the Confederate Flag from the Florida capitol state grounds to a museum as governor and increasing the number of African-Americans who work in the governor\u2019s administration. A fluent Spanish speaker, Bush\u2019s outreach efforts have been primarily focused on Hispanics, but he featured a young African-American woman in his announcement video last month who benefited from a school choice initiative that he started as governor. And on Thursday, the man he created the charter school with \u2013  T. Willard Fair, the president of the Urban League of Greater Miami \u2013wrote a glowing opinion piece in the Sun Sentinel, saying Bush has been his \u201cgreatest partner\u201d in doing \u201cwhatever was necessary to advance the progression of Black America towards Equal Opportunity.\u201d Such outreach efforts, however, have left some minority voters of both parties feeling taken for granted in the past. At an event with racially diverse pastors in Orlando on Monday, a black man asked Bush how he plans to serve minority communities in non-election years. \u201cLook, you can\u2019t be everywhere every place,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut you need to show a commitment day in and day out.\u201d The last time Bush and Clinton shared the same stage was at The Globalization of Higher Education conference in Irving, Texas in March 2014. Before that, Clinton and Bush shared a stage was at the 2013 gala for the National Constitution Center, whose board Bush chaired. Bush bestowed the group\u2019s Liberty Medal to Clinton, stating that she received it because she had \u201cdedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy.\u201d READ: A brief history of the Bushes vs. the Clintons",

            "article_content": "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee took to the pulpit of an African-American church in rural South Carolina on Sunday to address race in America. Huckabee\u2019s service came in the wake of the racially motivated massacre in Charleston, when a white man shot and killed nine African-Americans during a Bible study. \u201cI hear people say we\u2019ve got racial problems. We don\u2019t have a skin problem in this country, we have a sin problem in this country,\u201d said the former Baptist preacher, appealing to the mostly African-American congregation in attendance at the Rock Hill Missionary Baptist Church. There was handshaking and baby kissing and a strong religious message within Huckabee\u2019s speech, which marks a broader effort by the former governor to widen his appeal among African-American voters. On Thursday, the Huckabee campaign released a short video titled \u201cReconciliation,\u201d which featured clips Huckabee speaking in 1997 during the 40th anniversary of the Little Rock Nine, when Little Rock Central High School was desegregated. RELATED: Bush taking on \u2018Mount Washington\u2019 in speeches \u201cGovernment can ensure that we share schools and streets and lunch counters and buses and elevators and theaters,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cBut let us never forget that only God can give us the power to love each other and to respect each other and to share life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s southern roots provide him with a likely edge over some of his GOP rivals when it comes to winning African-American votes. In a 1998 CNN exit poll, the governor won 48% of the black vote in his re-election campaign, something he has proudly brought up before in South Carolina. He\u2019s also no stranger to the Palmetto State, as he has heavily focused his primary campaigning in South Carolina \u2013 and Iowa \u2013 since his announcement at the beginning of May. It\u2019s no surprise why: The two states are known for their religious conservative values and according to a recent CNN/ORC poll, Huckabee is the top pick of Evangelical voters. But Sunday, he said he did \u201cnot to come be a presidential candidate,\u201d but to assume the comfortable position leading a congregation. Rock Hill\u2019s pastor Leon Winn wove rhetoric of love and honesty into an introduction of the former governor, addressing the separation of black and white people here in Manning. \u201cI had the hair-brained idea to bring the black and the white churches together,\u201d said Winn, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran against Democratic Rep. James Clyburn in 2014. The congregation laughed and cried as the fresh memories of the Charleston shooting were broached numerous times. \u201cWe get all wrapped up in the things that divide us. Are you left or are you right? Are you Democrat or Republican? We didn\u2019t come here to scream at each other,\u201d Huckabee told the sweltering crowd. (Many congregants, despite the air-conditioning, still found themselves using hand-held fans to keep the heat at bay.) He preached a message of reconciliation with God and neighbor, pointing to a \u201cpride problem\u201d that has swept over America. \u201cIt\u2019s when we elevate ourselves above those around us and we don\u2019t understand that God doesn\u2019t elevate anybody over anybody,\u201d he said. Speaking of the Charleston murders, Huckabee said he was impressed how the families of the victims reacted to the slayings. \u201cThe reaction in Charleston was not lead by people who wanted revenge. They had to ask for God\u2019s grace. I saw the family members. I felt ashamed of myself because, I\u2019ll be honest with you, that was not my first reaction,\u201d he said. Sunday\u2019s \u201cfaith and freedom Sunday service\u201d marks the first time he\u2019s campaigned at an African-American church so far in the 2016 race, but it won\u2019t be his last, according to Hogan Gidley, the governor\u2019s senior communications adviser. After nearly an hour and a half, Pastor Williams concluded his service \u201cLike it or not, black folks, you need white folks. White folks you need black folks. We need each other. If we don\u2019t come together we\u2019re going to collapse as a nation.\u201d The congregation answered his call with a resounding, \u201cAmen.\u201d CORRECTION An earlier version of this story misidentified Leon Winn.",

            "article_content": "This may be President Obama\u2019s time, but it\u2019s still Ronald Reagan\u2019s era. Obama has helped negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, normalized relations with Cuba, and watched his approval ratings recently hit a two-year high after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obamacare. But has he become a \u201ctransformational\u201d president like Ronald Reagan? \u201cHe\u2019s simply plowing the ground Reagan cleared 30 years ago,\u201d says Tom Nichols, a political blogger and author of a column \u201cFantasyland: Obama Is No Ronald Reagan,\u201d referring to Obama\u2019s policies on nuclear weapons and his agreement with Iran. The Obama-Reagan comparisons are nothing new. Obama first made the comparison himself years ago when he declared that Reagan \u201cchanged the trajectory of America\u201d and \u201cput us on a fundamentally different path.\u201d But we took the comparison a step further.  We asked a group of historians and political scientists from the left and right to describe the qualities that make a president transformational. We also asked whether Obama lines up more favorably against Reagan now that he\u2019s reached a deal with Iran. The consensus was quick. Even those historians who personally disliked Reagan say Obama still hasn\u2019t matched the Gipper \u2013 at least not yet. Here are four reasons why: Before President Franklin D. Roosevelt came along, the notion that the federal government should help those who couldn\u2019t help themselves was not widely accepted. But Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal policies helped save the country from the Great Depression and encouraged generations of Americans to look toward the government for help in ways they had never done. That\u2019s what transformational presidents do: The country is a different place after they leave the office, historians say. Reagan meets that standard; Obama doesn\u2019t \u2013 that was the verdict from 12 historians and political bloggers. Reagan helped tilt the nation away from FDR\u2019s New Deal in a way that no president had done before, historians say. When Reagan declared in his inaugural speech that government wasn\u2019t the solution but the problem \u2013 and backed it up with small-government, anti-tax policies \u2013  he took on FDR. \u201cHe single-handedly defined government as something that was bad,\u201d says Charles Gallagher, a sociologist at La Salle University in Pennsylvania.  \u201cHe shaped the way we think of politics. He set in motion the belief that less government is much better.\u201d Reagan wasn\u2019t transformational from just a rhetorical point of view. His \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d \u2013 cut taxes on the rich to stimulate the economy \u2013 still shapes how we pay taxes today. \u201cWhen Reagan took office, the top income tax rate was 70%,\u201d says David O\u2019Connell, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. \u201cBy 1986, it had been reduced to 20%. We\u2019re never going back to that earlier level of taxation.\u2019\u201d Obama hasn\u2019t been able to do what FDR did, which is make people believe in the power of the government, though he\u2019s often talked publicly about the virtues of government intervention. He squandered his big chance to cut into Reagan\u2019s anti-government vision with his biggest domestic achievement, Obamacare, says Nichols, the political blogger. The botched rollout of Obamacare\u2019s website dashed any hope that people would stop looking at the government as the problem, Nichols says. Obama won the health care battle; Reagan is still winning the war over big government, Nichols says. \u201cWhat Obamacare proves is that governments can\u2019t do big projects well,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cHad the rollout gone smoothly, had they been more honest about how many were going to be losing coverage, he might have moved the ball.\u201d He is simply plowing the field that Reagan cleared 30 years ago Tom Nichols, political blogger Others, though, cite Obamacare to make the opposite argument: Obama is indeed transformational in ways that aren\u2019t obvious yet. Dylan Matthews of Vox online magazine says the Iran deal and Obamacare now make Obama one of the most \u201cconsequential\u201d presidents in U.S. history. Obamacare, he wrote, \u201cestablishes for the first time in history that it was the responsibility of the United States government to provide health insurance to nearly all Americans.\u201d Another writer also said Obamacare is transformational for another reason. It\u2019s the biggest attack on economic inequality since inequality began rising in the United States three decades ago \u2013 roughly when Reagan took office. Obamacare is a direct assault on the Reagan \u201cdon\u2019t tax the rich\u201d approach, wrote David Leonhardt, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor at The New York Times.  A big chunk of financing for Obamacare comes from raising payroll taxes on wealthy Americans, he says in an article entitled, \u201cIn Health Bill, Obama Attacks Wealth Inequality.\u201d Obamacare, Leonhardt, noted, is a \u201cdeliberate effort to end what historians have called the Age of Reagan.\u201d Some, however, say Reagan\u2019s transformation of America was for the worse. They say his term was marred by the Iran-Contra scandal, which led to the indictment of several administration officials. Critics also say he exploited racial fears by exaggerating the abuses of the \u201cWelfare Queen,\u201d a woman who allegedly collected food stamps while driving a Cadillac. Contemporary Republicans who talk about the \u201centitlement society\u201d and Obama being a \u201cfood stamp\u201d president are playing off  the racially coded language Reagan pioneered, critics say. Learn the story behind Reagan\u2019s Welfare Queen Even Reagan\u2019s condemnation of the federal government caused people to forget how it had improved the lives of so many ordinary Americans, says Wes Williams, author of \u201c5 Reasons Why Obama is a Much Better President Than Reagan (Or How To Make Conservative Heads Explode).\u201d \u201cReagan had people saying government is the problem while they were going to the bank with their Social Security check or to their doctors with Medicare,\u201d Williams says. A quick history test: Can you name some classic Reagan phrases? There\u2019s the line he delivered at the Berlin Wall during the Cold War when he told the Soviet leader, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d There\u2019s the quip he delivered to deflect questions about his advancing age at a presidential debate when he said: \u201cI am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d Perhaps it was because of his background as a Hollywood actor, but Reagan could deliver a great one-liner or speech. He was dubbed \u201cThe Great Communicator.\u201d But what about Obama? Any memorable words? Some historians say Obama isn\u2019t known for any signature one-liners or great phrases because he\u2019s too cerebral and measured. Obama has recently given two well-received speeches \u2013 one in Selma, Alabama, and the other a eulogy in Charleston, South Carolina, for black churchgoers slain by a white gunman. He ended the eulogy by singing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d But he still can\u2019t give a speech like Reagan, says O\u2019Connell, the political science professor at Dickinson College. Obama\u2019s two greatest speeches are the speeches he gave at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the race speech he gave in 2008 about his former pastor, O\u2019Connell says. \u201cFor all of his gifts as a speaker, Obama\u2019s most memorable speeches all seem to have been before he was President,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. \u201cHe\u2019s been more criticized for not expressing enough following events like the Deepwater Horizon spill or killing of Osama bin Laden. It\u2019s hard to see Reagan turning in similar performances.\u201d A lot has been made about Reagan and Obama\u2019s ability to negotiate with the nation\u2019s enemies. Reagan supporters say he helped end the Cold War by ramping up defense spending and negotiating with the country he once called the \u201cevil empire,\u201d the Soviet Union. Obama defenders point to Obama\u2019s ability to reach a deal to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But transformational presidents are also able to poach followers from domestic enemies or the opposing political party. Reagan was a master at persuading people who didn\u2019t normally vote Republican to vote for him in such great numbers that a new term was invented: Reagan Democrats. \u201cAlthough President Reagan is often described as a partisan, his legislative accomplishments were largely bipartisan,  and his re-election in 1984 came at the hands of a bipartisan voter coalition initially forged in 1980,\u201d says Jennifer Walsh, a political science professor at Azusa Pacific University in California. There is no such thing as an Obama Republican, Walsh and others say. Most of Obama\u2019s accomplishments came when he had sizable Democratic majorities in Congress during his first years in office, or through executive and administrative power. \u201cObama doesn\u2019t seem to mind if Republicans are unsupportive of his measures, and his re-election was secured by the strong turnout of mostly loyal Democratic voters,\u201d Walsh says. Perhaps that\u2019s the result of today\u2019s political environment: How could any President poach followers from the opposing party when there are so few moderates left? When Reagan came into office, he encountered a Democratic Party that was divided and demoralized, says Joseph White, a public policy professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. \u201cObama came to office in a crisis, but the Republicans were nowhere near as demoralized,\u201d White says. \u201cHe did not have on the GOP side anyone like \u2018Boll Weevil\u2019 Democrats with whom to bargain. Republican elites and voters united in opposition to him \u2013 if anything they got more extreme.\u201d Reagan also had another nickname, the \u201cTeflon\u201d president. Nothing bad seemed to stick to him, historians say. He became one of the nation\u2019s most beloved presidents because people simply liked him. Even his enemies responded to Reagan\u2019s geniality. See Obama\u2019s best unscripted moments \u201cReagan had a natural humor and an ability to disarm people,\u201d says Nichols, the political blogger. Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t project that kind of warmth to a lot of people. It\u2019s just not his nature. He\u2019s not a retail politics kind of guy.\u201d Obama has also been called one of the most divisive presidents in recent history. Some Americans genuinely seem to hate him \u2013 some perhaps because of his race. No modern president could ever be as beloved as Reagan because politics has become such a blood sport, Nichols says. \u201cObama could have cured cancer, and people who wouldn\u2019t have voted for him would still never vote for him,\u201d Nichols says. Yet Reagan was adored by his political base in a way that it seems Obama is not. Reagan made conservative cool. He strengthened the Republican Party. \u201cReagan came into office just a few years after Watergate, and he was able to rejuvenate the Republican Party by casting an ideological vision that encapsulated conservative ideas that Republicans had stood for in the past but had lost sight of,\u201d says Walsh, the professor at Azusa Pacific. Obama, however, doesn\u2019t fire up the Democratic base like Reagan did his party, some historians say. Some Democrats complain he is too moderate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and, more recently, Sen. Bernie Sanders, seem to have captured the heart of the Democratic Party for now. Obama also disappointed some of his Democratic followers because he never delivered on immigration reform and they don\u2019t think he talked enough about racism. He did talk about the black community\u2019s suspicion of police after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, when he said that \u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u201d But his most explicit talk on racism came this year when he delivered the eulogy for nine black churchgoers slain in Charleston. \u201cSomething like this had to happen for him to take the gloves off,\u201d Gallagher says, referring to the church shooting. \u201cHe should have been doing stuff like this months ago. Once you get elected to your second term you do whatever you want.\u201d The nuclear deal with Iran may have the chance of catapulting Obama into the category of transformational, but the results of that deal are too early to judge, one political scientist says. Even if Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran works out, it still won\u2019t compare to Reagan\u2019s agreement with the Soviet Union, says O\u2019Connell. He single-handedly defined government as something that was bad Charles Gallagher, sociologist, on President Ronald Reagan \u201cObama\u2019s agreement with Iran may only postpone a problematic inevitable \u2013 a nuclear armed Iran \u2013 while Reagan\u2019s deal with the Soviets helped bring about what was thought to be impossible \u2013 the end of the Cold War,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. The Obama-Reagan comparisons will continue long after Obama leaves office.  But one former politician says Obama has already outstripped Reagan\u2019s transformational status in at least one category \u2013 as an American symbol. \u201cThe Obama legacy will be less about government and politics, and more about the fact that he was the first African-American president, proving the American Dream is alive and well,\u201d says Ed Uravic, a former Washington lobbyist, congressional staffer and author of \u201cLying, Cheating Scum.\u201d \u201cBarack Obama became a transformational president the moment he was sworn into office.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama delivered a touching eulogy, a rousing political speech and a thoughtful meditation on race in America when he traveled to Charleston, South Carolina on Friday to speak at the funeral of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was gunned down last week by a racist terrorist during Bible study. But the President\u2019s speech will be remembered for a moment at the end when he launched into a solo of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d that at first stunned the mourners and then brought them to their feet as they joined him in song. Remembering Sen. Clementa Pinckney \u201cAs a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us for he has allowed us to see where we\u2019ve been blind,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe\u2019s given us the chance, where we\u2019ve been lost, to find our best selves.\u201d RELATED: Best week in Washington: Obama\u2019s legacy The President\u2019s remarks at times felt like a sermon, with organ chords backing him during some of the most impassioned passages. The mostly African-American crowd was, at the end of the eulogy, on its feet, clapping and cheering Obama as he named each victim of the church shooting and declaring each \u201chad grace.\u201d The President, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, a bipartisan host of high-level members of Congress and Hillary Clinton all attended the memorial service at TD Arena in downtown Charleston. Last Wednesday, a 21-year-old man opened fire at a Bible study inside Charleston\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, killing nine. The shooter declared he was there to \u201ckill black people,\u201d and an online manifesto attributed to him contained white supremacist screeds. Obama, in his eulogy, said the killer likely assumed he \u201cwould deepen divisions that trace back to our nation\u2019s original sin.\u201d \u201cBut God works in mysterious ways,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGod had different ideas. He didn\u2019t know he was being used by God.\u201d \u201cThe alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness,\u201d Obama said. Obama to deliver eulogy for slain Charleston pastor The country, he argued, has responded to the church shooting \u201cwith a thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life.\u201d Friday\u2019s funeral service for Pinckney wasn\u2019t the first time Obama delivered a high-profile eulogy, and with a year and a half remaining in office, it may not be the last. Read the President\u2019s eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney But on Friday, Obama\u2019s speech moved beyond just grief for the victims \u2013 the President stepped directly into a national conversation about race in which he plays a central role. He declared the Confederate flag a symbol of racial oppression, and praised the renewed urgency in removing it from the South Carolina State Capitol. \u201cRemoving the flag from this state\u2019s capital would not be an act of political correctness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought, the cause of slavery, was wrong.\u201d Unlike past times Obama has confronted an act of violence, he knew the highest profile victim of the Charleston shooting personally. Obama met Pinckney as an early supporter of his 2008 presidential bid. That personal connection differentiated Friday\u2019s eulogy from the funerals Obama keynoted after previous shootings. So, too, did the renewed questions on race spurred by the shooter\u2019s apparent motivations. \u201cNone of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. Every time something like this happens, somebody says, \u2018We have to have a conversation about race,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe talk a lot about race. There\u2019s no shortcut. We don\u2019t need more talk.\u201d Prior to the eulogy, Obama himself used some of his bluntest language to date on race during an interview with comedian Marc Maron on Friday, saying that just because the N-word is no longer used frequently in public, \u201cthat\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.\u201d How Obama responds to shooting attacks The moment was a distant cry from the earlier days of Obama\u2019s presidency, when he studiously avoided discussing race or the implications of his election to office. At Friday\u2019s funeral, Obama called for greater attention to less apparent forms of racism. \u201cMaybe we now realize the way a racial bias can infect us even when we don\u2019t realize it so that we\u2019re guarding against not just racial slurs, but we\u2019re also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal,\u201d he said. Victims of the Charleston church shooting CNN\u2019s Carma Hassan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "With the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 approaching later this summer, congressional Democrats filed legislation Wednesday to update and fix the landmark law they believe was gutted by the Supreme Court two years ago. In 2013, the high court\u2019s ruling in Shelby County, Alabama vs Holder outlawed a key part of the law, a requirement that certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls \u201cpreclear\u201d any changes to voting laws with the federal government before implementing them. Many members of Congress are concerned about rights being curtailed in some states after that ruling through strict voter ID laws and other measures. \u201cIt\u2019s important to fix a decision of the United States Supreme Court and make it easier, make it simple, for all of our people to participate in a democratic process,\u201d said Rep. John Lewis, one of the sponsors of the bill. \u201cOpen it up and let people come in. We\u2019ve got to do it. We\u2019ve got to do it before the next election. We cannot have the long lines, we cannot have the ID\u2019s, we\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d RELATED: Clinton calls out GOP opponents by name on voting rights Sponsors say the companion bills in the House and Senate target \u201cvoting practices known to suppress the voting rights of minorities and the disabled.\u201d Among other things, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 would expand the attorney general\u2019s authority to request federal observers at the polls and it would establish a new geographic formula for deciding which states need the federal government\u2019s permission to change voting laws, using a \u201crolling\u201d nationwide trigger. Only states that have been found to have repeated voting rights violations in the preceding 25 years would be subject to the pre-clearance requirement for a period of 10 years. \u201cThe Voting Rights Advancement Act is a voting rights bill for all Americans,\u201d said Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a sponsor, in a statement. \u201cIt is a bill for the next generation, and helps protect the legacy of the previous generation who fought so hard five decades ago for these voting rights protections.\u201d Earlier this year, Congress passed a bill to honor the thousands of people who marched for voting rights in Selma 50 years ago with a congressional gold medal, Congress\u2019 highest civilian honor. The bill drew broad bipartisan support, but that support may not extend to efforts to pass an update to the Voting Rights Act. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Alabama, a sponsor of the bill whose district includes Selma, urged congressional action. \u201cThere is an urgent need to protect the progress we have made since the courageous Foot Soldiers of the Voting Rights Movement dared to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge 50 years ago. We have inherited their legacy, and the fight to ensure that all Americans can participate in our political process continues today,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cThe updated coverage formula in this bill will ensure that states, like Alabama, are required to obtain federal preclearance for changes to voting practices and procedures that could have a discriminatory impact,\u201d she said. \u201cAlabama has a storied history of voter suppression, and it is ironic that the same state that launched the voting rights movement has become fertile ground for its demise.\u201d The new bill is just the latest of several efforts to pass similar legislation. In February, Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, and John Conyers, D-Michigan, both members of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, a bill aimed at updating and strengthening the law. Among other things, it would require greater transparency in elections so that voters are made aware of changes to voting laws and set up a new nationwide coverage formula that would require states or jurisdictions to preclear changes to voting laws if they have a persistent record of voting rights violations over the last 15 years. It was not taken up. Sensenbrenner and Conyers introduced the same bill in the last Congress and while it garnered support from then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia. That bill also went nowhere. It is not at all clear that the current effort will be more successful. Earlier this year, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, which has jurisdiction over the bill in the lower chamber, told a Christian Science Monitor breakfast he believed the Voting Rights Act was sufficient as it stands. A spokesperson for the committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August of 1965 and it has been reauthorized four times since, most recently by President George Bush in 2006, after it passed both chambers with overwhelming support.",

            "article_content": "He said what? On the face of it, President Barack Obama\u2019s use of the \u2018N\u2019 word in an interview released Monday seems out of character for a man who has made strenuous efforts to avoid provocative statements on race and to ensure that the color of his own skin does not dominate his presidency. The White House insists that Obama didn\u2019t set out to shock when he told comedian Marc Maron on his podcast that though race relations had improved over his lifetime, the United States was not \u201ccured\u201d of racism. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public,\u201d Obama said. 11 years of President Obama discussing race Obama\u2019s choice of words was jarring because he has gingerly picked his way through a string of political minefields over the last six-and-a-half years, thrown up by a series of racially charged episodes, from the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin to the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and, more recently, Baltimore. During his time in the White House, it\u2019s sometimes seemed as though Obama talks about race only when he has to, when circumstances or crises force him to weigh in. He\u2019s rarely spoken with the daring candor that marked his speech on race during the 2008 presidential campaign and he\u2019s tried to avoid political firestorms like the one triggered by his comments on the arrest of Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates during his first term. Obama has begun to speak more freely about race since he won re-election, including the launch of his \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative to mentor African American youths. But Obama\u2019s spokesman Josh Earnest said the President\u2019s use of the typically taboo word was not part of a premeditated strategy to talk about race in a more challenging and overt way. \u201cThere was no decision made on the part of anybody here at the White House that we are going to capitalize on this audio interview \u2026 (that) this would be an opportune time for him to get this particular point off his chest,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cI would acknowledge it is understandably notable that the President chose to use this word. But the argument that the President is making is one that is familiar to those who have been listening.\u201d READ: Israeli politician\u2019s wife apologizes for Obama \u2018joke\u2019 Obama remains more of a commentator on race issues than an activist, which his why his frank conversation with Maron raised the question of whether he had made a conscious decision to be more forceful on race relations following the brutal murder of nine African Americans in a gun massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. Cornel West reacts to Obama's usage of the N-word Jabari Asim, who wrote \u201cThe N Word: Who Can Say it, Who Shouldn\u2019t, and Why,\u201d said that Obama was \u201ccorrect in his instincts\u201d in using the word. \u201cIt\u2019s disingenuous to have a discussion about racism and not point to the language of racism,\u201d Asim said, adding that Obama also used the word in his memoir. Obama has also been the target of the racial epithet \u2014 he was barraged with tweets using it when he signed up for Twitter. In May 2014, a member of the police commission in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, used the word to describe Obama and subsequently resigned. But Asim called on Obama to do more to discuss race issues \u2013 and to go beyond voicing the \u2018N\u2019 word. \u201cHe still has a ways to go in talking about racism and I had hoped he would be more assertive in his second term,\u201d Asim said.  \u201cHe needs to address the idea that white people need to have a conversation about race among themselves.  It\u2019s the silent majority of white people who benefit from privilege and that needs to be topic one.\u201d Those disappointed in the way Obama has addressed race in the past welcomed his increasing willingness to talk about the issue. \u201cOur dear brother President \u2013 thank God he is now weighing in. How long has it taken him to talk honestly about how deep racism cuts?\u201d Cornel West, an author and academic who has been deeply critical of Obama on race, told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow. Bakari Sellers, a CNN contributor and former South Carolina state representative, said that Obama had been correct to speak so explicitly and to argue in the WTF interview that societies do not simply erase 200 to 300 years of discrimination overnight. \u201cI thought the President was right. He didn\u2019t mince terms. We are talking about racism being more than just the passive use of a derogatory term,\u201d Sellers told CNN. \u201cWe are talking about institutional and systemic racism. The President hit at the heart of the matter. This is not just about verbiage, this is about action.\u201d READ: Obama heading to Charleston to deliver eulogy But Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League, told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d that although he agreed with the president\u2019s broader point on race, he would have preferred Obama to be less explicit. \u201cI wish he had chosen to say, quote, the \u2018N\u2019 word as opposed to saying the word, because I have been long on record that coarse language used in any context in the pubic square is not the best way to talk about these types of issues. The \u2018N\u2019 word has never had a positive meaning,\u201d Morial said. Though Obama\u2019s choice of language was striking, Obama has made similar points in a more formal setting many times throughout his presidency, from his speech marking the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a Dream\u201d speech to off-the-cuff remarks during White House briefings at times of racial tension. \u201cTo dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed \u2013 that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years,\u201d Obama said on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when he honored King in 2013. \u201cBut we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn\u2019t bend on its own.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Just days before announcing his campaign for president, Martin O\u2019Malley placed a telephone call to Parris Glendening, the former Maryland governor. Their conversation turned at one point to the violent riots that engulfed Baltimore last month over the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose treatment in police custody intensified the national debate about police treatment of racial minorities. Glendening said that O\u2019Malley, a former Baltimore mayor, was aware that some critics blamed policing methods he put in place for tension in the city\u2019s streets. O\u2019Malley said he was convinced that larger, national issues of social and economic inequality were at work, Glendening recalled \u2013 issues that will be central to O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign. \u201cHe thought that this reinforced his basic point that we have a serious problem that\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Glendening told CNN. Moments from Martin O'Malley's career RELATED: O\u2019Malley sets sights on Hillary Clinton Now, O\u2019Malley\u2019s announcement that he will run for president is shining a spotlight on Baltimore, a city that was in many ways transformed during O\u2019Malley\u2019s tenure as mayor and governor. Plenty of residents give him credit for economic development and a sharp drop in crime. But others \u2013 particularly nonwhite residents \u2013 remain upset about O\u2019Malley\u2019s zero tolerance policing strategy that they believe fueled discrimination. These law enforcement tactics, critics say, resulted in police officers aggressively pursuing individuals for minor offenses and even taking innocent bystanders into custody. In conversations with CNN, five black Baltimore residents said Friday that they have experienced or witnessed police brutality against racial minorities. They don\u2019t look kindly on O\u2019Malley or his campaign for president. Bryant Carr, a 30-year-old born and raised in Baltimore who works as a porter at The Belvedere, a luxury condominium building in Mt. Vernon, said he was walking through a \u201cwhite neighborhood\u201d on his way to visit his mom several years ago when he was stopped by a police officer and taken into the precinct. \u201cI don\u2019t look dangerous. I\u2019m a black man in a white area in the wrong area. They were looking for a guy in a blue shirt and I clearly had a white T-shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cI cried. I cried. I didn\u2019t even do anything.\u201d O'Malley flashback: The 2007 Clinton endorsement Charles Swain, a 38-year-old man who was also raised in Baltimore and works at the Under Cut barber shop a few blocks south of Penn Station, claimed he was wrongfully accused of beating up a Hispanic person (\u201cI was walking with a Caucasian woman,\u201d he said), and taken to the police station. \u201cThey took my phone, sent me to jail, I had to pay a bill for something that I didn\u2019t do, you know?\u201d Swain said. \u201cAnd we went to the lawyer, we (were) like, well, what does it have to take \u2013 for them to start killing us? \u2013 for them to do something?\u201d O\u2019Malley addressed the sensitive issue head-on in his campaign announcement speech Saturday morning, where protesters periodically tried to interrupt his remarks. The former governor said the riots that broke out in the streets of Baltimore last month were not just about race or policing, but \u201cabout everything it is supposed to mean to be an American.\u201d \u201cThere is something to be learned from that night, and there is something to be offered to our country from those flames,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cThe scourge of hopelessness that happened to ignite here that evening transcends race or geography.\u201d But if some of the city\u2019s black residents say they\u2019ve experienced over and over again discriminatory actions of police officers, others have a very different view of Baltimore\u2019s police force. Robert Mitchell, a 48-year-old Polish-Italian construction worker who lives in Baltimore County, billed O\u2019Malley a successful mayor who made the city a safer place. Police brutality, Mitchell said, is a problem that\u2019s always existed, but has recently come to the forefront because of several high-profile tragedies like Freddie Gray\u2019s death. \u201cI think the police have to do what they have to do. If you\u2019re not committing crimes, then you don\u2019t have to worry about being abused or brutality coming at you,\u201d Mitchell said. Some of the city\u2019s business owners also remember O\u2019Malley\u2019s election to the mayor\u2019s office as a godsend. Mary Ann Cricchio opened up Da Mimmo Restaurant in Baltimore\u2019s Little Italy in 1984. Getting her business off the ground in an economically stagnant city felt impossibly difficult, she said. \u201cIt was just terrible. But then this young man, fresh out of law school, serving on the City Council, started to run for mayor. When we heard what he had to say, we were really excited and energized,\u201d said Cricchio, 53, who has been a years-long supporter of the former governor. \u201cWe believed in what he was telling us \u2013 that he could turn the city around. And he did.\u201d The numbers from O\u2019Malley\u2019s time in office are impressive. Can this Democrat really beat Hillary Clinton? Crime in Baltimore City dropped by 42% while O\u2019Malley was mayor \u2013 a reduction that his website bills \u201cthe steepest reduction of any major metropolitan city over a decade.\u201d Today there are fewer people incarcerated in the state than at any point since 1995 and homicides have fallen some 30% since 2006 \u2013 though Baltimore has seen a sharp spike in recent months. (May was the city\u2019s deadliest month since 1999, according to the Baltimore Sun.) Craig Martin, the owner of a boutique grooming store near Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor where O\u2019Malley frequents to get his hair cut, said the city\u2019s transformation since he opened his store in 2005 has helped local businesses flourish. \u201cWhen I told people I was opening a store in Baltimore, I was not getting: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s an awesome idea,\u2019\u201d Martin said. But 10 years later, his company has expanded and the Baltimore transplant now considers this city home. \u201cI truly believe in the future of our city and what\u2019s going on here.\u201d O\u2019Malley\u2019s political viability hinges greatly on the contrast he can draw between himself and Hillary Clinton, who is the clear frontrunner among declared and potential Democratic candidates. RELATED: Once a Clinton backer, O\u2019Malley now a top foe Martin O'Malley on Baltimore residents blaming him He is looking to do this in several ways, including by emphasizing his youth (the former secretary of state will be 68 by inauguration day in 2017), and making an appeal to a subset of the Democratic base itching for a more populist alternative to Clinton. Many of the progressive policies he\u2019s expected push as a national candidate will draw from his time as mayor and governor here. As governor, he helped enact same-sex marriage and a state version of the DREAM Act, ended the death penalty and passed strict gun control legislation into law. Jim Johnston, a 58-year-old federal government employee who lives in Mt. Vernon, said while he doesn\u2019t believe O\u2019Malley can beat Clinton, the former governor was nevertheless a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d public servant in Maryland. \u201cHe did a good job of standing up and saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re not going to be about homicide, we\u2019re not going to be about \u201cThe Wire\u201d anymore,\u2019\u201d Johnston said, in reference to the popular HBO TV show based on crime, drugs and law enforcement in Baltimore. Johnston added: \u201cHe actually did a very, very good job of saying, \u2018I stand for something different. I want peace in Baltimore.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "David Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d ends Wednesday night, but his \u201cTop Ten\u201d segment at times shaped the late-night political conversation. In honor of his last show, here are the top ten political moments on his show. 1. After skewering Sarah Palin\u2019s teenage daughter on a prior program, Letterman was forced to apologize for some parts of his routine. The comedian joked that Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez had \u201cknocked up\u201d the daughter. Letterman acknowledged that that joke was \u201cborderline\u201d but said he pursued it \u201cin an act of desperation to get cheap laughs, which is what I\u2019ve been doing for the last 30 years.\u201d \u201cI would never, never make jokes about raping or having sex of any description with a 14-year-old girl,\u201d Letterman said, noting that he was referring to her 18-year-old daughter, not the 14-year-old one. \u201cI would never, never think that it was funny to use a 14-year-old girl as a joke like this, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d 2. Letterman also attacked Palin\u2019s running-mate, John McCain, after he bailed on a 2008 appearance when he temporarily suspended his campaign. Letterman was clearly offended. \u201cWhen you call up at the last minute and cancel a show, ladies and gentlemen that\u2019s starting to smell. This is not the John McCain I know,\u201d Letterman said, criticizing him for quitting the campaign during the final months. \u201cThis is not the way a tested hero behaves.\u201d The jokester encouraged McCain to allow Palin, his \u201csecond-string quarterback\u201d to campaign in his stead rather than unilaterally suspending operations. 3. Letterman began his first show right after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks with a somber monologue addressing the tragedy from New York City. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost 5,000 fellow New Yorkers, and you can feel it. You can feel it, you can see it,\u201d Letterman said as he began his speech, praising Mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s response to the attacks. \u201cRudolph Giuliani is the personification of courage.\u201d 4. Letterman hosted his show during the entire presidency of George W. Bush, a president whose verbal miscues provided fodder for all late-night hosts. To commemorate the end of Bush\u2019s presidency, Letterman aired nearly four straight minutes of Bush mistakes in a recurring segment titled: \u201cGreat Moments in Presidential Speeches.\u201d \u201cWe have to unload what was a tremendous, rich heavy laden vein of comedy for us, like mining a dense vein of coal,\u201d he said. 5. In one of President Barack Obama\u2019s visits on the \u201cLate Show,\u201d the President and the comedian discussed surging racial tensions and whether any antipathy toward him was rooted in race. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s important to realize that I was actually black before the election,\u201d the President deadpanned. \u201cHow long have you been a black man?\u201d Letterman asked. 6. Only a week after being impeached as Illinois governor, Rod Blagojevich decided to appear on Letterman\u2019s show. \u201cWhy exactly are you here? Honest to God,\u201d Letterman said before Blagojevich had even settled into his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to be on your show in the worst way for the longest time,\u201d Blagojevich said. \u201cWell, you\u2019re on in the worst way, believe me,\u201d Letterman retorted. 7. Letterman had trouble hiding his skepticism for 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain\u2019s tax plan, dubbed \u201c9-9-9\u201d, routinely dismissing his vague answers and platitudes. Cain, at that time a promising Republican hopeful, faced a harsh comedian who grilled him on his platform. Cain accused Letterman of trying to talk him out of his plan. \u201cI like it, it\u2019s clever. 9-9-9. It\u2019s fun,\u201d Letterman said. \u201cYou ought to get some sort of toll-free number. You dial 9-9-9, you get a free pizza.\u201d 8. Letterman also recently had a tense exchange with Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, accusing him of making fake claims just like NBC newsman Brian Williams. O\u2019Reilly said the situations weren\u2019t the same and that he had never fibbed on air. \u201cWe had a controversy, and we put forth what my side was, and they put forth what their side was, and folks decided. And it worked out okay for me \u2013 I got even more viewers.\u201d 9. Soon after the \u201cLate Show\u201d debuted on CBS, Letterman hosted Vice President Al Gore. Letterman ribbed Gore for his reputation as a boring, excitement-free politician who rarely landed or tried his own jokes. Gore said he didn\u2019t mind that caricature or Letterman\u2019s jokes \u2013 and even offered his own. \u201cHow can you tell Al Gore from a room full of Secret Service agents?\u201d Gore asked. \u201cHe\u2019s the stiff one.\u201d 10. When interviewing fellow funnyman Al Franken, now a senator from Minnesota, Franken encouraged Letterman to think about what he should do after he left the \u201cLate Show.\u201d Letterman asked what he could do to improve Indiana politics \u2013 and Franken noted there would be an open Senate seat in the Hoosier State. \u201cI think you should run,\u201d Franken told him. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story misstated a joke Letterman made about Sarah Palin. He was referring to two of her daughters, not just one.",

            "article_content": "Presidents come into the Oval Office with all sorts of plans, but it\u2019s the unscripted moments that also define their legacies. A classic Ronald Reagan moment came when, while being wheeled into an operating room after being shot by a would-be assassin, he told his wife, \u201cHoney, I forgot to duck.\u201d President Jimmy Carter\u2019s surreal encounter with a hissing, demented rabbit dealt a major blow to his image. And President Gerald Ford suffered a similar fate when he slipped and fell in the rain while walking down the steps from Air Force One. No matter how much a president\u2019s handlers try to choreograph his actions, there\u2019s invariably some spontaneous encounter that shapes how the American public perceives a president. President Obama, who has been criticized for a Spock-like aloofness, is no exception. The only difference is, he became president just as the world of social media exploded, and his words and images have been retweeted, shared and transformed into online memes. He\u2019s not just the first black president; he\u2019s the first viral president. He now even has his own Twitter account. To be sure, some of those moments have been scripted, such as his Buzzfeed video to sell Obamacare and his \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d interview. Others, like his open-mic comments about his relationships with Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu, may have left Obama wishing for a do-over. But as his presidency approaches its final 18 months, here are some of the viral moments that offer a peek into Obama\u2019s playfulness and racial pride \u2013 as well as a mean streak that seems like a requisite for the Oval Office: Obama doesn\u2019t talk much about his race, but he\u2019s still found subtle yet memorable ways to invoke his racial heritage. Obama\u2019s bicultural language \u2013 he could communicate with black and white audiences in different ways \u2013 manifested itself in a video that went viral. In it, Obama is seen shaking hands with a white staffer in the Team USA locker room before offering Kevin Durant a vastly more expressive greeting. Such scenes inspired a famous skit by the comedians Key & Peele. In the first year of his presidency, a 5-year-old black boy visiting Obama in the Oval Office had an odd question for the president. The photo of Obama\u2019s answer became a classic. Obama\u2019s connection with working-class people of color helped propel him to the White House. An impromptu greeting he shared with a janitor captured that bond. Every president has to know how to work a stage. Obama took his penchant for performance in an unexpected direction one night when he stood on the famed Apollo Theater in New York City. One of the most memorable moments during Obama\u2019s presidency came early on when a Republican lawmaker yelled \u201cYou lie!\u201d while he gave a speech on health care to Congress in 2009. It was a prelude to vicious partisan warfare that would mark his term in office. Here are others. During this year\u2019s State of the Union address, Obama delivered a classic \u201cdrop-the-mic\u201d moment when Republican legislators heckled him. His response inspired Internet memes. Obama\u2019s competitive instinct is well-known.  During a tense televised meeting over Obamacare with Republicans, he delivered a putdown to his former Republican opponent for the White House that still hurts today when you listen. Obama\u2019s dislike of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was palpable. During one tense televised debate, Obama encouraged Romney to walk into a rhetorical trap with an ominous invitation that became a meme: \u201cPlease proceed, governor.\u201d Obama is known for being a bookish introvert who disdains the press-fleshing side of politics. But he also has a playful side that he flashed even amid the most the tense moments of his presidency. During one campaign stop at a Florida pizza shop, Obama met one supporter who couldn\u2019t contain his excitement. His \u201cgreeting\u201d of Obama became a classic photo. Even presidents have to walk the dog. The photo of Obama trying to keep up with Bo, the new presidential pup, captured his youthful vigor. Politicians get caught in all sorts of tangled webs. Obama\u2019s reaction to getting caught in one outside the Oval Office became a classic. Politicians hold babies at their risk. Photos of babies throwing up on the shirts of gamely grinning politicians fill the Internet. One crying baby, though, had a different reaction when Obama reached for her. The media has often looked at black families through the prism of pathologies: single-family homes, poverty rates, unwed mothers. But offering an almost weekly image of an intact, affectionate black family may be one of Obama\u2019s most underrated achievements. During an event marking the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama, Obama was sitting next to his wife onstage when they both did something that was subtle, and so romantic. To celebrate his 2012 re-election, Obama tweeted out a photo of him and his wife, Michelle, embracing with the simple message, \u201cFour more years.\u201d It would become the most retweeted photo in history. Four more years. pic.twitter.com/bAJE6Vom The President and his wife were at a Team USA basketball game in Washington when the \u201ckiss cam\u201d displayed their image before the arena. What they did next even made their oldest daughter, Malia, smile. After delivering his second inaugural speech before a huge crowd at the U.S. Capitol, Obama walked back from the podium with his family. He paused, turned around and took one last look at the now departing crowd. What he said next would go viral.",

            "article_content": "Will we see a surprise White House  guest star on the campaign trail? Marco Rubio plots his Iowa Straw Poll strategy John Bolton has \"radical\" plans for HIllary Clinton's 2016 campaign A potential First Ladies\u2019 Club, Marco Rubio\u2019s straw poll strategy, President Obama\u2019s unfiltered fourth-quarter attitude, John Bolton\u2019s role in the 2016 race, and 11 reasons why you can\u2019t count the long-shot candidates out. Those stories filled our Sunday trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table with guest host John Berman. Could there be a dynamic duo out on the trail next year? First Ladies' Club CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson says Democrats are buzzing about the possibility of Michelle Obama throwing her support to Hillary Clinton in a sort of Oprah Winfrey, Ted Kennedy-esque way. The current first lady definitely can dominate a news cycle \u2013 her commencement address at Tuskegee University was a hot topic on all media platforms. \u201cThe problem is, she really hates campaigning, right, and that\u2019s very well known,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cBut there is sort of a wild card in this, and that is a woman named Christina Shockey, who used to work for Michelle Obama, now works for Hillary Clinton. If someone can convince Michelle Obama to do it, it\u2019s probably Christina Shockey \u2013 and the prospect of extending her husband\u2019s legacy, as well.\u201d In President Barack Obama\u2019s 2014 year-end news conference, he warned Americans that things would be different in the fourth quarter of his presidency \u201cInteresting stuff happens in the fourth quarter,\u201d said Obama. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d And Bloomberg\u2019s Margaret Talev says we are really starting to see his rhetoric live up to that promise, as he called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren as just another politician and said Democrats were wrong about trade in an interview with Yahoo News; and in his speech at Georgetown where he talked about everything from the pain of his own father leaving him to what Fox News feels about poverty. \u201cI am looking ahead to next week, even as soon as tomorrow, when the President is in Camden, New Jersey, having a visit with a community policing program to look at how far they\u2019ve come in terms of racial progress,\u201d said Talev. \u201cHe\u2019s talking a lot more frankly about how he thinks and how he feels.\u201d We\u2019ll stay tuned for more from this unfiltered version of Obama\u2019s fourth-quarter presidency. Jeb Bush defended his strategy Saturday of not competing in the August 8 Iowa Straw Poll. The future of the Iowa Straw Poll \u201cAll the resources ought to go to the thing that matters, which is the Iowa caucuses on February 1,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhat\u2019s relevant is running a campaign, creating a strategy, building a good team toward success, which is in the primaries, and doing it in a way that makes it possible to actually win the general election, which is the whole objective.\u201d Some other candidates haven\u2019t made their intentions quite as clear. We\u2019re waiting to hear if Scott Walker will or won\u2019t compete there. But The New York Times\u2019 Jonathan Martin points out that \u201ccompete\u201d may have a different definition this time around. \u201cMarco Rubio, for example, may show up to speak there at the event, because there\u2019s going to be thousands of activists there that they want to reach, but I am told that Rubio, at least \u2013 \u2018absolutely positively,\u2019 to quote one of his advisers \u2013 will not spend money to bus supporters there,\u201d said Martin. \u201cSo competing there, what does that actually mean? Does that mean actually spending money or just showing up to speak? Important difference.\u201d John Bolton announced this week that he\u2019s not running for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.  But he gave The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa a hint about what he is going to do in the coming months during the primaries. Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said he\u2019s going to be spending about $6 million to $7 million to make sure his hawkish perspective gets out there during the debates, even though he won\u2019t be participating. But he\u2019s not limiting himself to the primaries. \u201cHe wants to use his political action committee and his presence to go up against Secretary Clinton, should she be the Democratic nominee,\u201d said Costa. \u201cHe was a classmate of Clinton\u2019s at Yale Law School and he calls her, quote, \u2018a radical\u2019 in our conversation. And he thinks he\u2019s going to make that point in a lot of ads this fall.\u201d In the next few weeks, Martin O\u2019Malley, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and George Pataki are expected to jump into the race. What do they have in common? \u201cWell, not many people give them a chance, which makes me think back to November of 2011, when I interviewed Rick Santorum about his first presidential campaign,\u201d said CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d guest host John Berman. \u201cAnd I spent a significant part of that interview noting again and again and again that not many people thought he had a chance. My exact questions included, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you doing better in the polls?\u2019 And \u2018Why isn\u2019t your message catching on?\u2019\u201d Less than two months later, Santorum won Iowa, and went on to win 10 other states before suspending his campaign. \u201cHe had a chance,\u201d said Berman. \u201cI was wrong and learned that perhaps we should see how they run before we call the race. So candidates, lace up those shoes and have at it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats looking for a leader on racial issues are suddenly finding one: Michelle Obama. The first lady is grabbing the attention of the political world after a commencement speech this weekend in which she spoke in strikingly personal tones about her experience of being viewed \u2013 and judged \u2013 through racial prisms. In a 30-minute commencement address delivered at Tuskegee University, a historically black school in Alabama, Obama talked about the \u201cnagging worries that you\u2019re going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason\u201d along with \u201cthe fear that your job application will be overlooked because of the way your name sounds.\u201d \u201cAs potentially the first African-American first lady, I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations \u2013 conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others. Was I too loud, or too angry, or too emasculating? Or was I too soft, too much of a mom, not enough of a career woman?\u201d she said. \u201cThen there was the first time I was on a magazine cover \u2013 it was a cartoon drawing of me with a huge Afro and machine gun. Now, yeah, it was satire, but if I\u2019m really being honest, it knocked me back a bit. It made me wonder, just how are people seeing me.\u201d READ: Michelle Obama says she was held to different standard in \u201908 campaign due to her race Her comments come at a time when President Barack Obama has faced criticism for only reluctantly addressing the racial tensions gripping the country. The remarks not only helped the White House find its voice on race but could also establish the first lady as an important figure heading into 2016 \u2013 a sought-after surrogate who might help Democratic candidates, including presidential contender Hillary Clinton, connect more deeply with African-American voters. \u201cShe has an opportunity to wield tremendous power and influence.  That can\u2019t be overstated.  I have seen firsthand how audiences respond to her, big and small,\u201d said Maria Cardona, a CNN contributor and Democratic strategist. \u201cShe is going to be a tremendous asset.\u201d Indeed, at least one line of her speech seemed tailor-made for the campaign trail, and would fit very easily into any stump speech. \u201cAnd the first thing we have to do is vote.  Hey, no, not just once in a while. Not just when my husband or somebody you like is on the ballot. But in every election at every level, all of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to vote, vote, vote, vote. That\u2019s it; that\u2019s the way we move forward. That\u2019s how we make progress for ourselves and for our country.\u201d The Obamas haven\u2019t waded into the nascent 2016 presidential season yet and it\u2019s unclear how often they might be out on the campaign trail. But Michelle Obama in particular could be in high demand as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis would be a first lady supporting a former first lady,\u201d Cardona said.  \u201cShe can do strategic targeted visits and campaign events, particularly with the Obama coalition as much as possible\u2013 young people, LGBT, Latinos, African-Americans.\u201d READ: Will diversity help the GOP in 2016? It\u2019s that voting bloc that has been most energized by recent racial flare-ups and has sometimes been disappointed by the President\u2019s even-handed approach. For his part, the President has talked about his experiences with racial discrimination \u2013 especially after the death of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2013 and, more recently, the riots in Baltimore. The White House announced last week that My Brother\u2019s Keeper, Obama\u2019s racial justice initiative aimed at minority boys, would become a new non-profit organization and form the basis of his post-White House work. But Obama\u2019s presidency came with outsized expectations about what he could do about the racial divide. Michelle Obama hasn\u2019t had the same expectations and though her comments at Tuskegee drew attention, she\u2019s often spoken more freely about race. As her husband sought a Senate seat in 2004, it was Michelle Obama who served as his \u201cracial validator,\u201d openly \u2013 and sometimes playfully \u2013 vouching for his \u201cblackness.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in this community. I\u2019m as black as it gets. I was born on the South side. I come from an obviously black family. We weren\u2019t rich. I put my blackness up against anybody\u2019s blackness in this state, ok?,\u201d she said in an interview with a Chicago television station. \u201cAnd Barack is a black man. And he\u2019s done more in terms of meeting his commitments and sticking his neck out for this community than many people who criticize him. And I can say that \u2018cause I\u2019m black.\u201d As first lady, she has often waded into race when speaking to young people of color, encouraging them to draw inspiration from her story and those of other African-Americans.

She is saying, don\u2019t wait for the cavalry, because there is no cavalry.\u201d While acknowledging the kind of feelings of frustration and isolation that \u201care playing out in communities like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country,\u201d Obama said giving up was not an option. \u201cBut, graduates, today, I want to be very clear that those feelings are not an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up,\u201d she said. Not an excuse.  They are not an excuse to lose hope.

            "article_content": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is known as a shouter, but last week he was the one being shouted down. \u201cWhat about the West Side?\u201d Arlene Jones, a local community activist, demanded of the mayor, interrupting his answer during an NAACP forum in Chicago\u2019s West Garfield Park neighborhood to a question on what he\u2019d do to solve inequality in the city. Jones continues, as the mayor, who\u2019s up for re-election Tuesday, stares on: \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard about Austin, Lawndale, North Garfield! We wanna hear about where we live!\u201d Underdog vies to take Chicago mayoral race It\u2019s a scene from the poorer half of the two cities that Chicago has become over decades of slow decline \u2014 a city divided down economic and racial fissures that deepened during the recession and show no signs of healing anytime soon. Those fissures contributed to the widespread frustration with Emanuel\u2019s leadership that drove him to a runoff with Cook County Commissioner Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia after he failed to top 50% support during the first round of voting, in February. Garcia is pitching himself as the only candidate capable of uniting the city after Emanuel\u2019s efforts to solve its problems have only exacerbated those divisions. But Emanuel has a pitch of his own: He\u2019s the only candidate with a realistic plan, and while it may require some hard cuts and concessions in order to right the city\u2019s finances, it\u2019s better than Garcia\u2019s murky alternatives. The runoff has become a proxy battle for a broader national fight playing out for the soul of the Democratic Party, between business-friendly moderates and income inequality-oriented progressives from the far left. They both campaigned feverishly through the final week of the race, a pace that produced a huge uptick in early interest in the race. By the time early voting ended Saturday, more than 142,000 Chicagoans had cast their ballots, a nearly two-thirds increase from the first round of voting in February. On Sunday, the two visited churches across the city \u2014 and for the mayor, a few egg hunts \u2014 for Easter, but both ended the day with a bit of levity, greeting supporters at Wrigley Field during the Cubs season opener against the St. Louis Cardinals. Public polls show the mayor opening a sizable double-digit lead in the final weeks before the runoff. But Chicago\u2019s never seen a mayoral runoff before, and no political strategist in the city will predict decisively what exactly will happen Tuesday. After Emanuel, who declined to be interviewed for this story, left the forum, Jones told CNN she was angry with the mayor because she felt that he\u2019s \u201cnot interested in us,\u201d the African American communities on Chicago\u2019s South and West side that have seen little economic development \u2014 and in many cases, considerable decline. \u201cI want to hear what the plans are for the forgotten side of Chicago,\u201d Jones said. Step outside the gymnasium where the forum was held, and that reality is readily apparent. Trash litters residential streets lined with boarded-up homes, pockmarked by empty, open lots and the occasional convenience store. The West Garfield Park neighborhood was one of Chicago\u2019s 10 poorest from 2008-2012, according to Census data compiled by Chicago demographer Rob Paral. In 2011, more than 40 percent of the neighborhood lived below the federal poverty line, according to Census data analyzed by the progressive Social IMPACT Research Center; that was a nearly 19% increase from 2007-2011. That\u2019s not atypical for Chicago\u2019s African American neighborhoods; according to the Census Bureau, African-American unemployment in Chicago in 2013 was 25 percent, higher than the unemployment for blacks in the rest of the nation\u2019s biggest cities. It\u2019s those empty, open lots that have Rep. Danny Davis working day and night for Garcia. Davis, a 10-term Democrat who represents a district that spans parts of the city\u2019s South and West sides, has come to campaign with the challenger at a Baptist Church in Chicago\u2019s Austin neighborhood on Sunday. He described the \u201cvast, vacant lands that used to be viable commercial strips\u201d on Chicago\u2019s South side before riots broke out after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and riots burned many businesses to the ground. \u201cNothing has happened to those vacant lands since,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not seen an urban redevelopment plan that would address that issue on the South side of Chicago, the West side of Chicago, other pockets of poverty.\u201d To Davis and other Emanuel critics, what economic reforms the mayor has implemented have only made the problem worse. In an effort to find savings to help stave off a looming pension crisis, Emanuel closed public health clinics and nearly 50 public schools that were underperforming and transferred the students elsewhere. He sought to raise taxes and fees through creative maneuvers, like expanding the use of red light cameras, and has proposed having many of the city\u2019s public workers contribute more to their pension programs. African Americans say many of those reforms have hit the city\u2019s minorities communities harder than the rest. And Emanuel\u2019s critics also point to his support from Republicans and wealthy Chicagoans as evidence that Emanuel is the mayor of the 1 percent, while Garcia\u2019s mayor of \u201c100%,\u201d as his campaign signs state. They\u2019ve also accused him of allocating property tax dollars from a city fund the mayor controls to benefit his allies. Garcia\u2019s message has galvanized the support of a number of national progressive groups, including some of the country\u2019s biggest unions, the Working Families Party and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, all of which are backing Garcia\u2019s campaign. And their support is a big part of what has Emanuel\u2019s advisers reluctant to predict a win. Garcia\u2019s campaign is predicting 6-7,000 volunteers will hit the streets for Garcia on Election Day to get out the vote, and they\u2019re relying on the organizational expertise of the city\u2019s teachers\u2019 \u2014 who will be free to volunteer all day, as school is out for spring break \u2014 to bring every last voter to the polls. Dave Schaffer, a top adviser to Garcia\u2019s campaign and his finance chairman, said in an interview Garcia\u2019s message is emblematic of the broader debate happening within the Democratic Party \u2014 and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll have the grassroots momentum drive him to a win on Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s is an actual attempt to have the true values of the Democratic Party return to the forefront. It\u2019s not the pay to play, it\u2019s not the corporate cronyism, it\u2019s not the lobbying abuse.\u201d Emanuel hasn\u2019t been idly standing by while Garcia organizes attacks \u2014 he\u2019s been fighting back with millions. Big donations from many of the city\u2019s top business leaders have driven Emanuel to a 12-to-1 fundraising advantage over Garcia, and boosted a super PAC backing his effort and the campaigns of a handful of alderman aligned with the incumbent. That fundraising advantage has funneled into ads from Emanuel\u2019s campaign focusing on one particularly potent argument against his opponent that appears to resonating with voters: Garcia doesn\u2019t have much of a plan of his own. The challenger released an economic policy proposal after weeks of dodging questions on his priorities, but is often murky on the details, saying the city\u2019s books are \u201cshrouded in a veil of secrecy\u201d so it\u2019s impossible to offer concrete solutions to the city\u2019s financial woes. It was only just this week that Garcia announced two members of the panel he plans to appoint to hammer out the details if elected. And much of his proposal relies on maneuvers it\u2019s not even clear he could pursue as mayor, like a progressive income tax, which would require an amendment to the state constitution to implement. Emanuel\u2019s argument has won over some of the city\u2019s African American community. Interviews with a half-dozen black Chicagoans over the past week revealed the general consensus: The devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t. \u201cI know what we have. I don\u2019t know what the other guy would do,\u201d said Rochelle Hardaway, a 52-year-old clerical worker at an Illinois state agency. \u201cI\u2019m going to go with what we have. I\u2019m going to continue to support [Rahm] because I believe in him, I believe his motives and his intentions are right.\u201d Emanuel has sought to close the deal by making Garcia seem unfit for the job, hammering him during a Tuesday debate as a \u201cHanukkah Harry\u201d for promising to put 1,000 additional police officers on the street, fund new school programs and still find the money to fix the city\u2019s pension problem and budget shortfall. And he\u2019s argued, meanwhile, that the unpopular moves he\u2019s taken as mayor have been the kind of tough-love policies needed to right the city\u2019s finances after decades of mismanagement under the Daleys. That argument\u2019s taken on added urgency as the city stares down a pension crisis that\u2019s caused financial agencies to issue multiple downgrades of the city\u2019s credit rating. \u201cEmanuel wants the issue to be, who is the most competent to get this city out of this financial mess? Who can best negotiate and deal with unions and deal with the governor?\u201d asked Paul Green, the director of the institute of politics at Roosevelt University in Chicago. But the economic debate, and persistent crime, is potent enough that it\u2019s put the city\u2019s sizable African American population up for grabs, and the demographic group could be pivotal in the runoff. A Chicago Tribune analysis found that the city\u2019s 18 majority-African-American wards accounted for about 40 percent of the ballots cast for mayor in February, and with no black candidate in the race, both Emanuel and Garcia are jockeying for the community\u2019s favor. Emanuel held a 700-person rally on Saturday featuring Chicago\u2019s renowned Jesse White tumblers at the Harold Washington Cultural Center, and later that day shook hands, snapped photos and quite literally kissed babies at the Black Women\u2019s Expo at Chicago\u2019s downtown McCormick Place convention center. Emanuel has also emphasized his ties to President Barack Obama throughout the campaign, tweeting out a picture of the president voting early for his former chief of staff to remind voters of their friendship. Garcia, meanwhile, features pictures of himself and Chicago\u2019s first African American mayor, Harold Washington, on his campaign literature to emphasize both his support within the black community and the historic possibility that he could become the city\u2019s first Latino mayor. And he\u2019s drawn on endorsements from Rev. Jesse Jackson and Emanuel\u2019s most prominent African American opponent in the first round of voting, businessman Willie Wilson. At least some African American Chicagoans said they\u2019re willing to give the uncertainty of the next four years with Garcia a shot over the disappointments of the city\u2019s past four years with Emanuel. Cheryl Salter, walking with her pro-Emanuel friend, Hardaway, at the Black Women\u2019s Expo, said that she planned to take a chance on Chuy \u2014 but noted she could always correct any mistake down the line. \u201cWith Rahm, I know what I\u2019m getting and I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m getting, so I\u2019m willing to invest four years in Mr. Garcia,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t like what he gives in four years then you know I\u2019ll go back to the polls.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday sent disputed redistricting plans in Alabama \u2014 drawn by a Republican-led legislature after the 2010 census \u2013 back down to a lower court to take a second look. Democrats had challenged the plans saying they impermissibly packed too many African-Americans into too few districts. A lower court had rejected the racial gerrymander claims launched by Democrats and upheld the maps. READ: Supreme Court says woman can sue UPS in pregnancy discrimination case Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for a 5-4 majority, said the lower court had done an incorrect analysis in part by failing to carefully examine the role of race on a district-by-district basis. Breyer, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan instructed the lower court to take another look. \u201cWe find that the district court applied incorrect legal standards in evaluating the claims,\u201d Breyer wrote. He said that a new analysis might provide \u201cstrong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate\u201d in some districts. Breyer also said the lower court erroneously analyzed the states\u2019 arguments under the Voting Rights Act. \u201cThe decision makes it slightly more difficult for the dominant party to draw a self-interested map and claim that the Voting Rights Act required them to do that,\u201d said election law expert Daniel P. Tokaji of The Ohio State University. The case stems from redistricting plans put in place by the Republican-led legislature following the 2010 census. A lawsuit filed by the Alabama Democratic Conference and the Alabama Black Caucus claimed the plans represented an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A line of Supreme Court precedent makes clear that districts drawn predominantly on the basis of race can only be justified by extraordinary circumstances. In court Alabama\u2019s Solicitor General Andrew L. Brahser defended the plans and said they were legally drawn to preserve the status quo because the Republican Party \u201chad won a majority for the first time in 130 years.\u201d He said the drafters of the plan were seeking to comply with a section of the Voting Rights Act by keeping the same proportion of black voters in each district as under previous plans. But a lawyer for the Alabama Democrats said the state employed \u201crigid racial targets to design all its black majority districts based on mere racial statistics alone.\u201d He said racial quotas in the context of redistricting are a dangerous business. \u201cThey can be a way of giving minorities faced with racially polarized voting a fair opportunity to elect, but they can also be a way of unnecessarily packing voters by race in ways that further polarize and isolate us by race,\u201d he said. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the opinion. Thomas took the opportunity to condemn the court\u2019s voting rights jurisprudence. \u201cI do not pretend that Alabama is blameless when it comes to its sordid history of racial politics,\u201d he wrote. But he said its redistricting effort was \u201ctainted by our voting rights jurisprudence\u201d and that special interest groups have hijacked the Voting Rights Act and used it \u201cto achieve their vision of maximized black electoral strength, often at the expense of the voters they purport to help.\u201d John Paul Schnapper-Casteras, a lawyer for the  NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund praised the decision saying it  provides \u201can opportunity for black voters to go back before a trial court to carefully examine how Alabama used race to limit black electoral strength.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A small group of House Democrats will meet with Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer over dinner Monday night in the hopes of starting to repair a damaged relationship, Rep. Steve Israel told CNN on Monday. But just how challenging that task will be was crystal clear Monday afternoon when White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said the administration would not overlook Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s flip-flop on Palestinian statehood last week. McDonough told a friendly crowd during a conference held by the pro-Palestine Jewish advocacy group J-Street that a two-state solution is \u201cthe best way to guard Israel\u2019s long-term security,\u201d and that\u2019s why Netanyahu\u2019s declaration that there would be no Palestinian state while he was prime minister \u2014\u00a0which he later disavowed \u2014 was \u201cvery troubling.\u201d \u201cAfter the election, the prime minister said that he had not changed his position, but for many in Israel and in the international community such contradictory comments call into question his commitment to a two-state solution,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cWe cannot simply pretend that these comments were never made.\u201d McDonough repeatedly pledged strong U.S. support for Israel, promising to \u201ccontinue to ensure Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge\u201d and echoing President Barack Obama\u2019s proclamation that the U.S. \u201chas Israel\u2019s back.\u201d RELATED: 367 House lawmakers warn Obama on Iran But his remarks underscore just how fraught relations between the two nations have become in the wake of Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress earlier this month, against the urging of the White House and a number of congressional Democrats, who saw it as an affront to the President. Following his election win last week, Obama told Netanyahu that he would \u201creassess\u201d U.S. support for Israel. Obama was reportedly particularly offended by Netanyahu\u2019s comments that Arab Israelis were coming out to vote in \u201cdroves,\u201d which critics said had racial undertones. Netanyahu apologized for those comments in a Facebook post on Monday. \u201cI know that my comments last week offended some Israeli citizens and offended members of the Israeli Arab community,\u201d Netanyahu said, according to a translation provided by his party, Likud. \u201cThis was never my intent. I apologize for this.\u201d Congressional Democrats, it seems, are looking to mend fences as well. Israel told CNN that he helped arrange the dinner with Dermer, which will take place at the Israeli ambassador\u2019s residence, in hopes of \u201ctamping down on the drama\u201d between Democrats and the Israeli prime minister\u2019s government.",

            "article_content": "As part of a Black History Month celebration, Republicans paid tribute to record-setting members of Congress It's part of the Republican National Committee's effort to build a more welcoming brand for the GOP As Republicans attempt to build more inroads with black voters, the Republican National Committee sought to highlight its progress on Wednesday, recognizing three newly elected black Republicans to Congress. The committee held its third annual awards lunch at the Howard Theatre, a historic black landmark in Washington where the RNC and more than 400 attendees also paid tribute to the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke, the first African-American popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, who died last month at the age of 95. The event recognized Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the first black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction (in 2014 he was elected to the same seat he was appointed to in December 2012); Rep. Will Hurd, the first black Republican elected to Congress from Texas; and Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. READ: Kasich heads to South Carolina Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets and a major GOP donor, helped introduce the three lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that we\u2019re dealing with \u2018firsts\u2019 in this century,\u201d Johnson told CNN in an interview after the event. \u201cThere should be \u2018seconds, thirds and fourths,\u2019 and really the Republican Party is open to all.\u201d While Republicans had a big year in 2014, Scott and Love still won largely with the support of white voters, while Hurd won with the support of white and Hispanic voters. In South Carolina, for example, Scott won 10% of the black vote, only slightly more than the other South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, who\u2019s white and brought in 6% of the black vote. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a ways to go,\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said on stage Wednesday. \u201cI know we\u2019re not going to carpet the world here in one or two years or one election cycle, but it\u2019s an improvement, and we always have to be improving as a party.\u201d Black GOP Black voter turnout in the midterm election this past November did reach into the double-digits in some states, like Florida (12%), Wisconsin (10%) and in Ohio, where Gov. John Kasich won re-election with 26% of the black vote. For her part, Love told a story about a student who asked Love how she\u2019s able to be a black Republican woman living in a red state like Utah in \u201ctoday\u2019s America.\u201d \u201cI am all of those things because I refuse to fit this mold that society tells me I need to fit into,\u201d she replied. SEE ALSO: GOP places hopes on new class of black Republicans Love also urged Republicans to focus on a message of being independent from government. \u201cPeople who are independent are the ones that make a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to remove ourselves from a different kind of slavery, and what I\u2019m talking about is the slavery that comes from being dependent on people in power.\u201d Narrowing the GOP\u2019s gap with minority voters became a priority following the 2012 presidential loss, when Mitt Romney won only 6% of the African-American vote and 27% of the Latino vote. Romney\u2019s privately recorded comments, in which he argued that 47% of Americans were dependent on government, became a damaging moment for the then-nominee, and it\u2019s a message that Republicans are still trying to run from. \u201cThe reason Republicans lost can be summed up in two words: 47%,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who\u2019s seriously considering a presidential bid, said recently at an event sponsored by the Koch Brothers. That lesson helped spur renewed attention to anti-poverty efforts, and some potential presidential contenders, like Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Chris Christie, have tried to appeal to minority voters by focusing on criminal justice reform. Wednesday\u2019s event largely stayed away from policy and focused more on efforts Republicans have made to build relationships with black voters through community outreach and black media. The party has spent millions on hiring staff who are tasked with improving the Republican brand in places with nontraditional GOP voters. \u201cAs we enter the presidential election year, we\u2019ll share our ideas with Americans of all backgrounds,\u201d Priebus said, adding that he\u2019s committed to building a more \u201cinclusive\u201d Republican Party. \u201cThis is about being present all the time. America is strongest when both parties fight to earn every vote. No voter should be taken for granted, and no voter should be overlooked,\u201d he said. The event also didn\u2019t touch on racial tensions that erupted last year with the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, or the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was killed by police in a chokehold in New York City. Both cases, in which the officers were not indicted, became a political flashpoint and spurred mass protests across the country. Michael Tyler, director of African-American media at the Democratic National Committee, argued the RNC lunch was simply a \u201cperfunctory gesture\u201d and called on Republicans to \u201cactually fight for the issues that most affect black families across the country,\u201d naming education, health care and minimum wage as examples. \u201cWhile minority \u2018outreach\u2019 is sorely lacking in today\u2019s GOP, what is even more lacking is a record of real results,\u201d Tyler said. CNN\u2019s Athena Jones contributed to this report.",

Smith and others follow path of greater enlightenment It was a terrible year for race relations in America. It was a glorious year for African-American literature. The first premise was affirmed by a poll conducted earlier this month by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal revealing that only 34% of Americans believe that relations between the races are fairly good or very good, compared with the 77% who shared this belief in the wake of Barack Obama\u2019s election as President seven years ago. In light of this, mass media would do well to acknowledge the better news that there has been an outpouring of innovative, boundary-breaching fiction and nonfiction by black writers rivaling waves of similar breadth and dimension that rose during the 1960s and 1970s. More than 40 years of history separates the cries of \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d from \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Everything that\u2019s happened in between \u2013 from the Rodney King riots to the polarizing verdicts in the trials of O.J. Simpson and George Zimmerman to the high-profile deaths of black Americans at the hands of police officers and the too often violent aftermaths \u2013 suggests that we are still very far away from realizing the dream of a \u201cpost-racial\u201d society envisioned after the 2008 election. But artists and writers are inclined and empowered to dream bigger than the rest of society. And the black men and women who published their deepest dreams and brightest ideas this year could lead the rest of us toward a broader vision. Arguably the most prominent of these books was Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d which has appeared prominently on several \u201cyear\u2019s best\u201d lists and last month won the National Book Award for nonfiction. A nationwide best-seller, Coates\u2019 trenchant, emotionally detailed blend of memoir and j\u2019accuse on the persistence of racism in the age of Obama, hip-hop and Ferguson is written as a letter to his 15-year-old son \u2013 just as one of the essays in James Baldwin\u2019s 1963 best-seller, \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d is in the form of a letter to his young nephew. Using vignettes, memories and cultural analysis, Coates interrogates the value of black lives in America, an urgent, especially topical subject in a year when the Black Lives Matter movement galvanized activists and angered many others. It\u2019s a book that people will continue to talk about and argue over as events in and out of the courts, from the Freddie Gray trials to Supreme Court deliberations over affirmative action, continue to surge through news feeds. Even with Coates\u2019 book dominating attention, black women made comparably significant contributions this year to African-American memoir. In \u201cNegroland,\u201d Margo Jefferson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and critic, took an inquisitive, gimlet-eyed tour of her past as a child of the so-called \u201cTalented Tenth\u201d elite of black America, when growing up privileged and highly educated in Chicago didn\u2019t always insulate you from the hazards and humiliations of racism during the 1950s and 1960s. Two award-winning poets, Tracy K. Smith and Elizabeth Alexander, contributed their own deeply personal and beautifully rendered reminiscences. Smith\u2019s \u201cOrdinary Light\u201d is a warm, witty account of how it felt to grow up in Northern California in the 1980s as the daughter of someone who helped put together the Hubble Space Telescope, while Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe Light of the World\u201d chronicles in tender detail her romance and marriage to an Eritrean refugee and artist, who died unexpectedly. Black novelists, meanwhile, continued probing the past for revelation and perspective on their people\u2019s past. Among the best of these books was Jabari Asim\u2019s \u201cOnly the Strong.\u201d  With lean prose and deep compassion, it examines the lives of African-American men and women of different generations from a large Midwest city as change overtakes them in the early 1970s. An even more intriguing trend among black novels in 2015 was their cheeky willingness to challenge narrow-minded definitions of what it means to be black in America in the 21st century. T. Geronimo Johnson\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Braggsville\u201d attracted comparisons with David Foster Wallace, Mark Twain and Toni Morrison with its stylistically adventurous saga of a multicultural quartet of Berkeley students protesting a Civil War re-enactment in a Georgia town. And Mat Johnson\u2019s acerbic and humane \u201cLoving Day\u201d divulges what happens when a mixed-race comic book artist, returning to his Philadelphia home town after divorce and fiscal ruin in Europe, discovers he\u2019s the father of a mixed-race teenaged girl. Together, they discover that even the ghosts haunting his Irish father\u2019s abandoned house are somehow struggling to define themselves in a world where things, literally, aren\u2019t always black or white. Raising the stakes of such satiric invention was Paul Beatty\u2019s \u201cThe Sellout.\u201d Even more impudent and audacious, it recounts the adventures of a young black Southern Californian seeking to retain his rural community\u2019s identity through such dubious means as re-segregating its local schools and taking on a onetime member of the Little Rascals as his slave. Beatty, Johnson and other comic novelists have claimed their respective debts to \u201cOreo,\u201d a raucously inventive 1974 novel, republished this year to great acclaim, by the late Fran Ross, who conceived this picaresque tale, with mythic overtones, of a young mixed race woman who bolts Philadelphia to search for the Jewish father who abandoned her. Considered ahead of its time even when first published, Ross\u2019 novel has been brought back at a time when black writers of varied backgrounds, preoccupations and styles seek even greater autonomy over how their lives are depicted. As American society struggles to disentangle itself from the knotty, exasperating constrictions of prejudice and injustice, its black artists, seizing their imaginative independence, continue to forge a path toward greater enlightenment. As they assert who they are, their country may figure out what it can be. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "CNN and outside commentators weigh in on winners and losers in the Democratic debate in New Hampshire Clinton and Sanders made up on data breach dustup, sparred on 'regime change' ; O'Malley had tough words for Trump Democratic candidates for President took part in their party\u2019s last debate of the year Saturday night in New Hampshire.  Here\u2019s a range of views from CNN commentators and other observers. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors. The final Democratic debate of the year was one of the few remaining chances for Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley to make a strong case against Hillary Clinton \u2013 and both men passed on the opportunity.  With less than 45 days until the Iowa Caucuses, Sanders and O\u2019Malley must decide which they prefer \u2013 winning applause or winning elections. To win applause, you do what both men did at the debate: put forward proposals on domestic and foreign policy and politely point out disagreements with Clinton, the front-runner.  But with polls showing Clinton enjoying a commanding lead in all the early states except New Hampshire (where she is a few points behind Sanders), the path to the Democratic nomination requires making an argument to voters that Clinton won\u2019t, can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t win the general election next fall. Neither Sanders nor O\u2019Malley was willing to go that far. \u201cThe greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall street is destroying this economy,\u201d Sanders said, pointing out that Clinton has a cozy relationship with Wall Street. But Clinton was ready. \u201cI have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street,\u201d she responded, pointing out that only 3% of her donors work in banking and finance. And for good measure, Clinton made sure to mention that two hedge fund billionaires are running ads in New Hampshire that attack her. Sanders more or less let the matter drop there, but that won\u2019t convince millions of Democratic voters that Clinton might someday sell them out. That is the kind of accusation Sanders and O\u2019Malley must make clearly and frequently if they want to displace her at the top of the polls. But neither man has done so, and should expect to remain 20-plus percentage points behind her. There\u2019s no shortage of differences between the candidates. Sanders and O\u2019Malley say the minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour; Clinton wants to keep it lower. Sanders wants to make college tuition free on every campus; \u201cI don\u2019t believe in free tuition for everybody,\u201d said Clinton. On national security, Sanders and O\u2019Malley both made a case \u2013 rather timidly, considering what was at stake for them \u2013 that Clinton is too willing to push for regime change in turbulent nations around the world. But all three candidates pointedly bashed Donald Trump and the Republican party, and here they were singing from the same songbook. \u201cOn our worst day, we have a lot more to offer the American people\u201d than Republicans, said Sanders. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans running for president,\u201d said Clinton. It was a reminder that Clinton wants the primary season to end as quickly and painlessly as possible so she can start preparing for the general election. The fact that Sanders and O\u2019Malley seem willing to play out her ideal strategy makes it seem less likely than ever that Democrats will see Clinton toppled from the lead. Errol Louis is the host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. Well, it\u2019s obvious why the Democratic contenders would rather discuss the economy than national security, which is the top concern among voters: they don\u2019t have any answers. Hillary Clinton offered \u201ccoalitions\u201d as a solution to any number of foreign and domestic dangers. The answer to guns? Coalitions. ISIS? Coalitions. She touted her own record of coalition-building in Libya and Iran, which Republicans will have fun with in a general election. She said simply that she\u2019d \u201cdo more to keep us safe at home.\u201d She suggested Russians would respect a no-fly zone in Syria. Does anyone trust Hillary Clinton\u2019s instincts on Russia? Bernie Sanders seems to think he will be able to magically make Muslims in the Middle East fight ISIS so that we don\u2019t have to. When pushed, he offered no explanation as to how he\u2019d accomplish what this administration has not. Moments from Martin O'Malley's career O\u2019Malley tried to \u201cgenerationally\u201d distinguish himself from Clinton and Bernie but talked primarily about boosting intelligence efforts, which is hard to do without added boots on the ground. While criticizing government spying, they each heaped praise on spying on each other. \u201cSee something, Say something\u201d is a PR campaign, not a national security policy. These aren\u2019t serious strategies, but merely continuations of our current strategy at home and abroad to lead from behind. S.E. Cupp is the author of \u201cLosing Our Religion: The Liberal Media\u2019s Attack on Christianity,\u201d co-author of \u201cWhy You\u2019re Wrong About the Right\u201d and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The Democrats had their third debate in New Hampshire Saturday and there was literally no mocking, no belittling\u2013and the fact checkers kept coming up with \u201cmostly true\u201d (for Clinton, at least). The contrast with the Republicans, was stark. Less than 24 hours before the debate, red-hot press releases and charges flew between the Sanders and Clinton camps over a donor list data breach.  On stage, Sanders and Clinton showed how adults handle disputes. They each made their point, then made up.  Sanders showed Trump how a man takes responsibility, and apologizes. The contretemps was dispensed with in the first few minutes. There followed spirited debates over regime change, gun control, and middle class taxes. For the most part, the candidates at Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate in New Hampshire were on the same page. In fact, the most common phrase of the night may have been \u201cLet me agree\u2026.\u201d The candidates even found room for agreement with all of the Republican candidates on one important strategic issue\u2014you can never go wrong by attacking the frontrunner of the other party. Just as the GOP candidates spent much of their debate attacking Hillary Clinton, all three of the Democrats went after Donald Trump. Senator Bernie Sanders said that Trump \u201cthinks low wages are a good idea.\u201d Governor Martin O\u2019Malley warned that we \u201cmust never surrender our American values to racists, must never surrender them to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.\u201d And Secretary Hillary Clinton pointedly said of Trump that \u201cHe is becoming ISIS\u2019 best recruiter.\u201d Whether or not Trump is the eventual Republican nominee, all of the Democratic candidates clearly understand that they can benefit by being forthright in condemning the direction that the Trump candidacy is taking the Republican Party\u2026 because the Republicans clearly don\u2019t seem to have the courage to do that.

A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \u201cCooking with Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Does anyone have an actual ISIS plan? Hillary Clinton remained steadfastly convinced in the debate last night that Americans should buy into her strategy\u2014that they should trust the person who almost singlehandedly turned Libya into an ISIS breeding ground to somehow remake Syria into the kind of progressive democracy that would justify U.S. assistance. Never mind that Clinton\u2019s strategy is virtually indistinguishable from most of her Republican rivals\u2014build an international coalition, vaguely contain the terrorists, and leave the door open for eventual ground troops. Bernie Sanders had the best moment of the night when he impugned the Clinton/GOP consensus on deposing Middle Easter dictators. \u201cRegime change is easy \u2026 but you have to think about what happens the day after,\u201d he said. Sanders demonstrated that he is one of just a few candidates\u2014on the other side of the aisle, libertarian-leaning Republican Sen. Rand Paul is another\u2014who understands the chaos that follows ill-considered U.S. intervention in Syria. It\u2019s one of the main reasons war-skeptical millennials continue to prefer him to Clinton. Her rebuttal that Sanders also supported the failed intervention in Libya was hardly convincing\u2014it was her war. Meanwhile, Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s ludicrously off-putting demeanor\u2013he took a dig at his rivals for being older, for goodness sake\u2013made it hard to pay attention to him, even when he was echoing Sanders\u2019 concerns about ill-considered Middle Eastern interventions. Robby Soave writes for the libertarian magazine Reason. Follow him on Twitter @robbysoave. Last Tuesday\u2019s GOP debate was nearly entirely devoted to ISIS. Jeb Bush called the group an \u201cexistential threat,\u201d and none disagreed. Candidates proposed a surveillance state so large, or a military footprint so huge, or an aggressiveness so audacious, that it was hard to know just how high taxes would have to go to pay for it. If I had to guess, to rates even Bernie Sanders wouldn\u2019t tolerate. Tonight was the first Democratic debate since San Bernardino, and what a contrast with the themes and tone of the GOP\u2019s version. There was much to like. Not only did Martin O\u2019Malley denounce Trump, as he consistently has (tonight he called him a fascist), but he stood up for the Muslim community from the get-go. He showed up with more energy than he had for last debate, though it never seems to translate into any momentum. The race is still between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and it is still Clinton\u2019s to lose. She was calm and confident tonight. She often had the audience laughing (she showed up late after a break in the second half and managed to turn that into a light moment). And she even wrapped it all up with a Jedi invocation. That said, I saw new reason to wonder about her candidacy tonight. Why Putin praised Trump Hyping the threat posed by Islamic extremism allows Republicans to overlook more pressing problems: income inequality, racial injustice, the shrinking middle class, climate change. Very often, when they make the issue of national security a dominant concern, Democrats turn hawkish. Clinton did that in her support for the Iraq war. What is to say that she will not do so again? Sanders laid out, very clearly, why he believes intervention is problematic, and why our foreign policy adventures backfire. (O\u2019Malley seconded him.) Hillary seems more cautious about joining in. Maybe that\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to be hit on her Iraq war record, or maybe that\u2019s because she hasn\u2019t really changed her positions. Haroon Moghul is a fellow at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. He is an author, essayist and public speaker. Follow him @hsmoghul. The Republicans Party should be worried. The New Hampshire debate proved once again that Hillary Clinton has not been spending her time playing grandmother. She has prepared thoroughly to take on whoever becomes the GOP nominee. Whether or not you agree with her views, there is no denying that she is as well versed on a wide range of issues as anyone in the race. The debate offered a stark contrast with the Republicans\u2019 invective-plagued season. The Democrats were civil and the debate sharply focused on policy differences. GOP debate: A night of high stakes in Vegas In contrast to Bernie Sanders, Clinton showed more hawkish foreign policy views than President Barack Obama. She is carefully staying fairly close to the president during this primary phase, but expect changes once she is nominated. She offered a preview of what\u2019s to come. In the fall, she will highlight the differences, explaining how Syria and ISIS went out of control partly because Obama rejected her advice to arm moderate Syrian rebels years ago. Syria served as a canvas to draw the candidates\u2019 overarching views of America\u2019s place in the world. Sanders used the old line about the U.S. not being the world\u2019s policeman.  Hillary said, \u201cIf the United States doesn\u2019t lead, there\u2019s not another leader. We have to lead.\u201d Where does Trump stand on that?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. With an electorate distracted by the six shopping days left until Christmas, I didn\u2019t expect much out of the Democratic candidate\u2019s debate tonight. Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders continued to pull away from Governor O\u2019Malley, who lacks Sanders\u2019 authenticity or Clinton\u2019s experience. Sanders dealt with a dustup with Clinton over a data breach quickly and effectively. Clinton made gun control a national security issue. And everyone piled on Trump. But I noticed something, or rather the absence of something, that I hadn\u2019t before:  fear. You see, the defining characteristic of American politics for the better part of 20 years has been fear. Fear of terrorism, fear of the deficit, fear of change, fear of immigration. We have become so used to the fear in politics that it\u2019s absence can be frightening in itself. But tonight I was reminded that we weren\u2019t always so scared and we can\u2019t afford to be now. Tonight we saw a politics that wasn\u2019t running scared. We\u2019ll find out next year whether it\u2019s a winning strategy, but tonight it certainly felt good.

She also serves as senior advisor to Correct The Record, a super-PAC supporting Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jennifer Granholm: Donald Trump's rhetoric is causing irreparable damage to United States Democracy doesn't need candidate who intentionally stokes jingoism, she says If last night was any indication, the Democratic nominee may not have anything to worry about. Even though some say Hillary Clinton would benefit if you were to be the GOP nominee, for the good of the country I want you to get out of the race.  Your lies and vitriolic rhetoric are causing irreparable damage to the nation. In \u201cThe Leadership Challenge,\u201d a best-selling tome on leadership by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, 89% of people across the globe identify honesty as the most important characteristic of a leader. It seems counterintuitive, then, that despite spewing lies every week and managing to offend people of every race, creed and color, you have still managed to sit atop the Republican presidential candidate polls for five months. In Trump World, you can fabricate historical events to falsely embellish your golf course, or worse, spread lies about a nonexistent video that you claim showed thousands of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey after the twin towers fell. It would be one thing if your lies were careless or unintentional missteps, mistakes that you would admit when presented with facts and then move forward. Instead, you refuse to acknowledge reality and choose to double and triple down on your lies. It is as if you believe you are above the truth, that whatever you believe is fact, and whoever confronts you is unfairly attacking you. Your lies have led the media to declare you \u201cin a league of [your] own\u201d when it comes to making claims that repeatedly fail \u201cto mesh with reality.\u201d Why don\u2019t your lies seem to matter? Donald Trump: His own words Perhaps it\u2019s because your lies prey on the fears of your supporters, many of whom have nascent fears that they are losing \u201ctheir country\u201d and must do whatever they can to \u201ctake it back.\u201d Each day brings a new Trumpian lie involving racist and derogatory smears against whole groups of people, lies that may energize your followers \u2013 but which rot our democracy. Opinion: What Donald Trump\u2019s supporters really hate Did this movie predict Trump's rise? This tactic is not new for you; we all recall the ease with which you spread lies about President Obama\u2019s birth certificate in 2012. And while the targets were different then, your lies now have the same intended result: to demonize certain communities by manipulating facts and capitalizing on fear. For many of your followers, perhaps attacking the perceived cause of their fears is more important than you telling the truth. After all, your statements have been labeled \u201cpants on fire\u201d lying 11 times since the beginning of your campaign, yet you still outpace the rest of the Republican field by double digits in many polls. You probably recognize this cognitive dissonance and don\u2019t care because it aids you and your ambition. But my deep fear is that if you win the GOP nomination, the general election will divide the nation more than by Democrats and Republicans: It will end up pitting entire segments of our population against one another based on race, religion, gender and more. Opinion: It is Rubio and Cruz, not Trump and Carson Why do politicians get away with lying? The last thing democracy needs is a candidate who intentionally stokes jingoism and makes racial animus mainstream. Before you do further damage to the country, Donald, the best way to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is for you to drop out of the race. *Editor\u2019s note: A previous version of this article had an outdated version of the author\u2019s bio, which has now been updated.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Martin O\u2019Malley, a former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore, is seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Presidential candidate Martin O'Malley says he believes death penalty should be abolished Death penalty costs states more than a life sentence does, he says On Friday night, South Carolina will host a Democratic presidential forum. And while the field of candidates may now be down to three, there are still many issues confronting this country that need to be discussed. These are critical issues that have not received the attention they deserve, but raise questions that go right to the heart of who we are as a people. It would, of course, be a glaring oversight to ignore the struggles South Carolina has faced over criminal justice reform \u2013 challenges we as a country are all grappling with. However, there is a particular, fundamental flaw in our justice system that other candidates appear to lack the commitment to address \u2013 our failed reliance on the death penalty. This is a tragedy both because it is a racially biased punishment, and also ineffective in deterring crime. Our nation was founded not on fear and retribution. It was born from higher things: freedom, justice, human dignity, and equal rights before the law. And so we must ask ourselves: Are these principles compatible with the \u201ccivil\u201d taking of human life? Are these principles compatible with the very real risk of erroneously taking the life of an innocent neighbor? Can we credibly accept any criminal justice plan that does not commit to ending the death penalty for good? I believe the answer is clearly no. It is time that we, as a nation, abolish the death penalty for good. Our nation\u2019s legacy of slavery and racial injustice find continued offense in our use of the death penalty. Our death row population is more than 40% black \u2013 nearly three times the proportion of the general population. Reforming our criminal justice system to save and redeem more lives is not as simple as changing just one thing. But we should be able to admit that we must do more of what works to save lives, and we should stop doing things that do not work. In study after study, in state after state, we see the same distressing pattern. The death penalty does not deter crime. It does not even save us money. In fact, the death penalty actually costs states more than a life sentence does, because of an endless appeals process that tears at the hearts of victims\u2019 surviving family members. The vast majority of executions on this planet take place in just a handful of countries: Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, North Korea, China and the United States of America. Our country does not belong in the company of these nations on matters of criminal justice and equal rights under the law. The longer we continue to support this expensive and failed policy, the more we fall short of our values as a people \u2013 and the more money we waste that could be spent actually saving lives. My own personal and longstanding opposition to the death penalty is shaped by deep belief in the principles of our nation and by my faith. I don\u2019t agree with the official Church position on every public issue, but I believe that perpetuating the death penalty strikes at the heart of the nation we should aspire to be \u2013 one that\u2019s more just. The reality, though, is that we will not abolish the death penalty in America by following polls. It requires leaders who are willing to call us forward based on the deepest principles we share as a nation. A policy that is as shameful and immoral as the death penalty is not about states\u2019 rights \u2013 it is about human rights. Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed logic on this issue \u2013 continuing to support the death penalty as a state right that should not be abolished \u2013 rings all too familiar to me. My advisers told me, as I took on the death penalty during my first year as governor in Maryland, that I was misguided. They encouraged me not to take up this cause, to instead focus on issues that poll better and are more popular. I didn\u2019t listen because my faith and my own experience taught me otherwise. As mayor of Baltimore, I understood that every minute and dollar spent on the death penalty could have been used to protect and redeem lives. As a prosecutor, I saw that the death penalty\u2019s racial legacy could not be excused or explained away \u2013 and that too many innocent lives were being taken by this profoundly flawed practice. So I decided to fight for the death penalty\u2019s repeal. We didn\u2019t succeed the first time \u2013 or the second. But after four years of making our case to the people of Maryland, we finally banned the death penalty on our third try. Now, in this election, our leaders should be honest with themselves \u2013 and with voters. The death penalty is a failed and immoral policy. But while we can admit our mistake and work to become a more perfect nation, we need leaders who have the courage to act. We must repeal the death penalty under federal statutes, including the 1994 crime bill, and every candidate for president should say where they stand on this issue. The choice is really ours. We know what works. We know what does not work. And we know that the way forward is always found through greater respect for the human dignity of all.

Wilson is the co-founder and executive editor of TheGrio.com, a site dedicated to news and perspectives that affect and reflect black America. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram @mrdavidawilson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. David Wilson says Dr. Ben Carson is the Republican Party's latest great black hope He says Carson's popularity makes conservatives feel good about themselves and their views Dr. Ben Carson is the Republican Party\u2019s latest great black hope. New polls released this week show that the neurosurgeon turned politician is now sitting on top of the crowded GOP presidential field alongside Donald Trump. The soft-spoken Carson, who has never held a political office, is electrifying the GOP\u2019s base, and ironically, he\u2019s doing it with a campaign that conjures the excitement of a doctor\u2019s visit. While conservatives have long accused  their political counterparts of white liberal guilt, those on the right are showing their own brand of it.  The modern day Republican Party has always had a strained relationship with people of color, but the election of President Obama has deepened the rift. Go ahead, admit you\u2019re a racist Ben Carson reacts to questions over past violence Many in the GOP and tea party have been accused of bigotry for denying the legitimacy of and being unwilling to work with the nation\u2019s first black president, although many conservatives will argue that their disdain for the President has nothing to do with his race, but with his politics. Even so, the \u201cracist\u201d label has begun to take a toll on the party\u2019s brand and, I believe, their conscience. Ben Carson's origin story surprises Detroit neighbors However, Carson is their latest \u201cmagic negro;\u201d he is someone who makes them feel good about themselves and their beliefs. The divine intervention that transformed him from being a violent, quick-tempered black boy in an impoverished Detroit to a celebrated Yale-educated brain surgeon is what evangelicals\u2019 dreams are made of. He presents himself as an example of how minorities can lift themselves up from poverty through God and with little government intervention. Although some of the accounts of his childhood are now being questioned, it may do little damage to his reputation with his growing conservative fan base. The new threat: \u2018Racism without racists\u2019 His harsh criticism of Obama, the Black Lives Matter movement, Muslims, and Mexican immigrants provides the political right with racial cover. Their logic is that if a black man says it, then it can\u2019t be racist. Their support of him is proof to progressives that they too are willing to vote for a black man. If you\u2019re trying to boast your racial tolerance credibility these days, \u201cI\u2019m voting for Ben Carson\u201d sounds a lot more convincing than \u201csome of my best friends are black.\u201d Muslim-American group calls on Ben Carson to drop out Ben Carson campaign rolls out rap ad However, Carson is not a new phenomenon. Clarence Thomas has occupied this role from the bench for decades now. But since 2008, Republicans have been searching for their version of Barack Obama. They first made Michael Steele the chairman of the RNC in 2009. Steele\u2019s goal was to prove that not only are conservatives not racists, they can speak in outdated hip-hop slang too. When Steele didn\u2019t do the trick, the party threw him under the bus by painting him as a \u201chood rich\u201d black man who mismanaged the party\u2019s finances by using their credit cards on private jets, limo rides, and strip clubs. Then came the 2012 elections and the party\u2019s love-affair with Herman Cain. Cain was a conservative radio host and the former head of Godfather\u2019s Pizza turned presidential candidate. Cain was most effective with conservatives when portraying their political enemies as the true oppressors and by challenging Obama\u2019s blackness. Cain would suggest that African-Americans are ignorant sheep held captive on a \u201cDemocrat plantation.\u201d  However, Cain\u2019s history of womanizing and potential sexual harassment was too much for the party to abide. The power of Ben Carson's humility But for many African-Americans, Thomas, Steele, Cain and now Carson\u2019s popularity with the right is reminiscent of an old racial dynamic. During and post slavery, white slave owners and employers would often provide special treatment to select blacks, who in turn would help assuage their white guilt. It became the role of these black servants \u2013 who were often deemed a \u201ccredit to their race\u201d \u2013 to heap praise on the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cGod-fearing\u201d white boss, often at the expense of their own people. Ben Carson: \u2018Democrats tend to look more at the color of their skin\u2019 To be clear, the Republican Party should be encouraged to search for African-American candidates and political stars. What\u2019s offensive is that they are propping up inept and inexperienced blacks to run for the highest office in the land. Carson, like Cain, is hardly Barack Obama\u2019s political equal. He lacks serious political knowledge and at times appears lost when pressed on details of his domestic and foreign policy agendas. His skin color and his willingness to criticize other black and brown people is at the heart of his appeal to the right. The Republican Party is now engaging in political affirmative action of the worst kind and in the most visible way. Carson has excelled at telling the far right precisely what they like to hear and think. He doesn\u2019t challenge their beliefs, he confirms them. News Corp. owner Rupert Murdoch \u2013 the foremost expert on all things black \u2013 went so far as to say that Carson would be a \u201creal black president.\u201d No one can confidently predict what will ultimately become of Ben Carson\u2019s campaign. However, with the caucus and primary season fast approaching, we\u2019ll know soon enough if his popularity with the base is for the benefit of their conscience or if he truly has their confidence.

Tanya Odom: With Julian Bond's passing, the civil rights movement loses another hero She says we must pick up baton on pressing issues of voting rights, incarceration, equal education \u201cI do think that some of us began to realize that this was going to be a long struggle that was going to go on for decades, and you\u2019d have to knuckle down. A lot of people in our generation did that. They didn\u2019t drop out and run away.\u201d \u2013 Julian Bond The nation lost another civil rights hero last week with the passing of Julian Bond. And we have lost him at an important time in history. This year marks the anniversaries of milestones in the history of civil rights and equality. It marks the 50th anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d the Watts riots and the Voting Rights Act, the 60th anniversary of the brutal murder of Emmett Till, and the 60th anniversary of Rosa Parks refusing to sit at the back of the bus in Montgomery. In this year, we are especially obliged to practice mindful humility and ask ourselves about our individual and collective commitment to a country that is truly dedicated to \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d Remembrances alone will not change things. We must consider the here and now: for progress on issues of rights and equality, we are called to action at the individual, community, and organizational levels. What have we learned so many years after these momentous events? When I interviewed Boston civil rights activist Mel King last year in connection with the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer 1964, I asked him about his memories from that historic time. His responses highlighted the need to move beyond commemorative Facebook memes, posts, and merchandise for sale \u2013 to action. \u201cWe have to understand the myths about \u2018liberty and justice for all,\u2019 otherwise we will be here in this same place, 100 years from today,\u201d he told me. In his remarks on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Obama challenged us to think beyond focusing on one day. \u201cFirst and foremost, we have to recognize that one day\u2019s commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough. If Selma taught us anything, it\u2019s that our work is never done \u2013 the American experiment in self-government gives work and purpose to each generation.\u201d I visited Selma, Alabama, twice this year as part of the National Parks Service\u2019s \u201c50th Anniversary Walking Classroom\u201d experience. We walked highway 80 from Selma to Montgomery. Over five days we connected with a diverse intergenerational group of people committed to commemorating that critical march for equal access to voting rights.  A second visit was with chief diversity officers on the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act. Both trips sharpened my understanding and knowledge about the history of civil rights, and the importance of connecting current-day challenges to the narratives, experiences, and pioneering work of people like Julian Bond. We were acutely reminded through stories, photos and personal histories that people literally sacrificed their lives to take a stand at times in our history where this might have meant sanctioned surveillance, physical brutality, jail time and even death. One cannot help but connect the recent loss of life in U.S. cities and towns \u2013 the increase in political action and mobilization over civil and human rights \u2013 to those earlier, powerful moments. (One of the many articles highlighting the life of Julian Bond, quoted a family friend as saying, \u201cHe was one of the architects of the Black Lives Matter movement before there was a hashtag.\u201d) How do we put these new stories of both blatant and unconscious bias within a historical framework? It\u2019s crucial that we try. We are losing a generation of foot soldiers, pioneers, and civil rights activists. They are in their 70s, 80s, 90s, and even 100s (Dr. Amelia Boynton Robinson turned 104 on Tuesday.)  They committed their lives to this cause. Women and men like Julian Bond, Boynton, Rep. John Lewis, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Mel King, Dr. Bernard Lafayette and countless others, many whose names we do not know, paved the way for all of us in this country. Reflecting on Bond\u2019s passing, Lewis observed to NPR that he \u201cmust be remembered as one who inspired another generation of young people to stand up, to speak up and speak out. He traveled all over America, speaking on college campuses, but also to large groups for peace, for nonviolence and for protecting the environment. One of his latest \u2013 probably the last thing that he wrote \u2013 was about including the gay, lesbian, transgender communities as part of the civil rights legislation of 1964. He supported that effort.\u201d Indeed, it is a time of notable progress in many areas, and we rightfully can celebrate our advancement. But honest reflection and analysis also shows us that it is also a time when we still need to question issues of access and opportunity, voting rights, incarceration practices, equal education and opportunities for gains in workplaces around the country. Our call to action must include asking hard questions about the lack of gender and racial/ethnic diversity in Silicon Valley and other industries. It must challenge us to think about the support and cultivation of leaders who are not scapegoating or villainizing groups of people, and who are committed to change \u2013 in seeing what Mel King describes as \u201cthe humanity of the other.\u201d As we approach an election year, our call to action must also include leaders that who will not \u201cdrop out and run away.\u201d Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

He is the author of \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society\u201d and co-editor of a new book, \u201cMedicare and Medicaid at 50: America\u2019s Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton in a New Hampshire poll and is drawing big crowds Julian Zelizer: Clinton needs to learn from Sanders' success and focus more on the grassroots Hillary Clinton can\u2019t afford to ignore Bernie Sanders any longer. She has a serious problem on her hands. Sanders is showing that his campaign poses a genuine threat. He is drawing massive crowds months before the caucuses and primaries begin and without much of a staff to speak of. The media has been drawn to his message and last week he even won the endorsement of the largest nurses union, National Nurses United. Given that candidates in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary tend to benefit heavily from enthusiastic grassroots organizing, it is possible to imagine Sen. Sanders scoring two shocking victories that would send HRC into a tailspin. Although a CNN poll in Iowa shows Clinton significantly ahead of her Democratic opponents at this early stage, a New Hampshire poll created concern with Sanders doing better than Clinton in that early primary state. The ongoing story about her emails has also fueled serious concerns among supporters about whether scandals will consume the Clinton campaign. Now Vice President Joe Biden is considering entering the race, a move which would potentially cut directly into Clinton\u2019s natural base of support. What should Hillary Clinton do about the Sanders candidacy? Without question, she will be prodded to attack more ferociously. She will be told that the only way to defeat opponents is to destroy them. Remembering what happened to Clinton in 2008 when she underestimated Barack Obama, her staff will certainly push her to strike soon and to effectively bring Sanders\u2019 run for the presidency to a quick end. Though the temptation to savage an opponent is always strong, Hillary Clinton might also want to draw lessons from the fervor that is propelling the Sanders campaign and incorporate some of his strategies into her own playbook. Rather than only seeing Sanders as an adversary, she should view the Sanders campaign as one that can offer her the competitive push that she needs to electrify her campaign with new ideas. At the heart of the Bernie Sanders campaign is an unabashed call for Democrats to adhere to their ideological traditions. For much of the 20th century, the Democratic party was about using the federal government to solve major social problems and to build the infrastructure of the nation. At some level, the promise was that simple. Since the New Deal, Democrats have turned to government to assist the poor, to boost and protect wage earners, and to grow the middle class. The federal government regulated banks so that average Americans could have confidence in the financial system, and provided a social safety net on which everyone could count in hard times. The federal government was also the solution to ending racial segregation and protecting voting rights. When the elderly needed health care, Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats provided that protection through federal programs called Medicare and Medicaid. Sanders has spent much of his time on the campaign trail talking about what government does well. His supporters have been responding. Hillary Clinton has been listening. In recent weeks, she has offered some more assertive and specific proposals on issues such as inequality, unaffordable education and dealing with climate change. But she will need to do much more, to embrace a full-throated belief in the value of government. Clinton needs to make this a central campaign theme \u2013 highlighting the Democratic confidence in government as a fundamental difference between her and whoever the Republican nominee might be. One of the most inspired moments in her campaign thus far came at the National Urban League conference in Miami when she surprised Jeb Bush at an event, questioning his determination to achieve racial justice by talking about the ways in which Republicans have not shown any commitment  to the programs that can achieve that goal. Mocking his \u201cRight to Rise\u201d super PAC, Clinton said: \u201cPeople can\u2019t rise if they can\u2019t afford health care. They can\u2019t rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on. They can\u2019t rise if their governor makes it harder for them to get a college education.\u201d Hillary Clinton must also use the Sanders campaign as an opportunity to be reminded that, like in 2008,  the grassroots remains at the heart of political campaigns. This is not simply about having a shrewd campaign strategy or instructing advisers in Brooklyn to set up the correct networks in Iowa. Sanders' campaign manager: He speaks to what people feel Rather, nurturing the grassroots is about hitting the campaign trail with the kind of fervor that most candidates reserve for fundraising. Like Sanders, she needs to literally immerse herself into the crowds and deliver passionate speeches that resonate with voters. Her campaign team needs to make her appearances real political events where like-minded voters and activists can come together to fight for a cause. She needs to open up and to be direct \u2013 unafraid of the media spin \u2013 in the same manner that Sanders has employed when he takes on the power of big business or blasts a broken political process. Clinton must also be sure to emphasize the historic and distinct nature of her campaign. One of the most remarkable aspects of Sanders is that he is proud to be running far left of center in an era when liberalism has been under constant attack. He sees his campaign as a major effort to defend the legacy of these ideals in a more conservative era of politics. Besides championing a clear set of values, Hillary Clinton should not downplay the fact that the election of a female president, and of someone who has always been a strong champion of government policies to help women in the workforce and in the family, would be a historic breakthrough in this country just like the election of the first African-American. The GOP has made a series of mistakes, ranging from Donald Trump\u2019s nasty comments about Megyn Kelly to Jeb Bush\u2019s remark about government funding for women\u2019s issues revealing the tensions within the party about dealing with policy issues that matter to female voters. If Clinton embraces this part of her campaign \u2013 which her critics such as Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed as the \u201cgender card\u201d \u2013 she could energize millions of voters who might otherwise be lukewarm about her campaign. In a country that took over a century to give women the right to vote and in a political system where sexism remains a huge problem, the election of Hillary Clinton would be a historic milestone. Clinton should clearly be scared. Yet seen from the right perspective, Sanders offers her a great opportunity to become stronger just as the nation heads into the formal phase of the campaign.

That case is on appeal. The views expressed are her own. Sandra Bland died last month in a Texas jail Natasha Korgaonkar: Waller County has difficult, painful history on race It\u2019s a process that has become all too familiar for civil rights lawyers this past year \u2013 sitting at a computer poring over yet another video showing a state official killing or injuring another unarmed Black person. But hearing of the death of Sandra Bland in a Waller County, Texas, jail was especially challenging for me. As a voting rights lawyer, I have spent a great deal of time working in the county, west of Houston. I know its history of racial discrimination and how that history is inextricable from the quality of democracy available to Black Waller County residents today. And ask any voting rights advocate in the country, and he or she can confirm a troubling reality \u2013 Waller County is ground zero for Texas\u2019 long and inglorious history of racial discrimination against Black voters. Waller County is the location of beautiful Prairie View A&M University, of which Bland was an alumna and where she would have been an employee if she were alive today.  It is Texas\u2019s second-oldest state university, and first historically Black university. Built in 1878, the university was initially named Alta Vista Agricultural & Mechanical College for Colored Youth, after the plantation on which the university was built \u2013 a plantation that was, not long before the founding of Alta Vista A&M, home to several hundreds of slaves. Who was Sandra Bland? In 1971, when Congress ratified the 26th Amendment enabling 18-year-olds to vote, the county newly included a substantial Black voting base of Prairie View students. County officials responded by trying to enforce illegal property ownership and residency questionnaires to exclude these students from voting. The county\u2019s efforts to prevent Prairie View students from voting lasted through eight years of federal lawsuits and judicial intervention. Ultimately, it was a 1979 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that ended this unlawful practice. But Waller County persisted. In 1992, the county prosecutor filed bogus \u201cvoter fraud\u201d charges against Prairie View students. Upon receiving a letter from the Department of Justice, the county dropped the charges expeditiously. In 2003, when a Prairie View student announced his intent to run for County Commissioner\u2019s Court, the then-Waller County district attorney published a letter in the county newspaper stating his plan to indict for \u201cvoter fraud\u201d any students voting in that election who did not meet his personal standards for legal voting residence. Even when students won an injunction against these threatened prosecutions, the county did not abandon its efforts. Instead, election officials reduced early voting days to a single six-hour period on one day, in spite (or perhaps because) of election day coinciding with the university\u2019s spring break week. Local advocates had to file yet another emergency lawsuit to prevent these efforts. With the normal early voting period restored, the Prairie View student candidate narrowly won a seat on the county body. Remarkably, this was not the final chapter in Waller County\u2019s unremitting efforts to prevent its Black citizens from participating in the political processes to which the U.S. Constitution guarantees access. In 2007 and 2008, the county imposed a number of arbitrary and unlawful requirements on new voter registrations, without gaining the necessary federal permission. A disproportionate share of the initially rejected registrations belonged to the county\u2019s youngest voters \u2013 students at Prairie View, most of whom were Black. Perhaps Sandra Bland, who graduated from Prairie View in 2009, was among those who celebrated being able to cast a ballot for the first time. Either way, federal intervention from the Department of Justice eventually enjoined the county from continuing to impose the unlawful registration burdens. As we try to piece together how a citizen can be detained for a minor traffic violation, then slammed into the ground, then incarcerated for days, and, finally, mysteriously lose her young life, it is at best naive \u2013 and at worst willfully ignorant \u2013 not to consider that Waller County is a place where adaptive and intransigent resistance to Black participation in the political process has been potent and sustained. Last year, a federal district court found that Texas\u2019s new voter ID law is part of a long, unbroken line of voting discrimination in the state. In reaching her conclusion, the judge relied on the testimony of Vernon Burton, a historian whose testimony focused in no small measure on Waller County. To understand Bland\u2019s story, we must connect the dots. Police brutality that interferes with, and even ends, the lives of Black citizens does not occur on its own. The county and state systems this takes place in are buttressed \u2013 and even protected \u2013 by local governments that are closed, in varying degrees, to Black citizens and other vulnerable communities of color. In spite of the difficult and painful history of Waller County, it does not surprise me that Bland sought to return to her alma mater, this time as an employee rather than as a student. I have met many students at Prairie View. For them, the Prairie View campus is an oasis within Waller County \u2013 perhaps the smallest unit of democracy there \u2013 with a rich tradition of success. Every year on election day, I travel to Prairie View\u2019s campus to monitor polls and to ensure that student voters are not unlawfully prevented from casting their ballots. I will do so again this year. And as I drive down the very street where Sandra Bland was stopped, I will reflect again on the immensity and enormity of this dusty and sleepy county\u2019s history.

As governor of Georgia, I successfully pushed for the replacement of that flag during our 2001 legislative session.

It did not come as a surprise. My predecessor as governor, Zell Miller, had a political near-death experience running for re-election in 1994 after attempting to persuade our Legislature to replace the 1956 flag in 1993. Many believe my effort to change the flag led to my defeat for re-election in 2002. That year, the Georgia Republican Party\u2019s candidates, including its gubernatorial nominee, promised that if elected, they would hold a referendum that would allow Georgians to vote to bring back the state flag with the Confederate battle emblem. The tactic worked. Republicans won the governor\u2019s office for the first time since Reconstruction. Report: Activists take down Confederate flag in South Carolina The irony was obvious when watching a Republican Party whose first president was Abraham Lincoln rallying around the Confederate battle flag. It was, however, the ultimate example of the party\u2019s successful \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d begun by President Richard Nixon to exploit Southern whites\u2019 discontent with the Democratic Party\u2019s increasing support for civil rights and the growing racial diversity of its membership. Georgia shows the strategy\u2019s effectiveness. In 1998, when I was elected governor, five other Democrats were elected to statewide office with me (including two African-Americans and a woman) as well as big Democratic majorities in both houses of the Legislature. Now, less than two decades later, Republicans hold every single statewide office here (all white men), and supermajorities in both legislative chambers. Now it is heartening to see some Southern Republicans shifting to address the issue of Confederate emblems being used by state governments in our region. As I stated in my speech to legislators in 2001 calling on them to pass the bill taking down the 1956 flag, my great-grandfather was captured at Vicksburg while fighting for the Confederacy, and I am proud that he bravely did his duty to his community as he understood it. As I said, however, in a speech at the John F. Kennedy Library in 2003, while I honor his bravery, I recognize that the cause he fought for \u2013 slavery \u2013 was wrong. The symbols of that cause have no place on government emblems or grounds, and should be removed. Should Confederate history be taken down from the U.S. Capitol? As important as it is to remove divisive symbols of racism from our public life, I hope our efforts to eliminate signs of our eras of slavery and segregation extends to matters beyond the symbolic. Our past still haunts us in public schools that are inadequately and inequitably funded. Too many of our children never get the chance to reach their full potential because they are condemned to schools that don\u2019t have the resources to educate them to succeed in modern life. Likewise, many of our best state universities still do not have student bodies that are as diverse as the taxpayers who help pay for them. In Georgia and across the South, we have higher prison incarceration rates than other parts of the nation, and African-Americans are imprisoned at much higher rates than whites. This historic lack of commitment to ensuring that every child gets the chance to get a quality education, accompanied by sky-high incarceration rates among African-Americans, is as much a sign of our tragic racial history as is the Confederate battle flag, and one that is long overdue in being addressed. With all of these challenges facing us at the dawn of the new century, Georgia, along with many Southern states (and some others around the nation), has put new restrictions on voting rights in the name of fraud prevention that everyone knows have the actual effect of discouraging political participation by eligible citizens, especially potential black and Latino voters. That is a continuation of a shameful history of denying the franchise to minorities. Walmart CEO: No more Confederate flags The Republican Party in the South created its modern dominance on racial division, building a supermajority of white voters to win elections. Ironically, this strategy now gives it the chance to bring change to our region in a way that would be much more difficult for Democrats such as me. The Republican Party can speak to its supporters about the need for change in the South, and push forward into areas and topics that my fellow Democrats and I cannot gain the standing to enter. One example here in Georgia is Republican Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s push to reform draconian sentencing laws that we have enacted over the last several decades. A Democratic governor would no doubt be attacked as \u201csoft on crime\u201d and be hard-pressed to garner significant GOP support for such an effort. A Republican governor, however, can make the case as an ally to his party\u2019s legislators and supporters about the need for such reform. Let us hope that the public discussion about the need to address the aftermath of our tragic racial history continues, and that Southern Republican officeholders continue to help lead that discussion. Let\u2019s also hope that the discussion \u2013 and action \u2013 moves beyond flags and monuments to schools, economic opportunity, justice and the encouragement of the civic participation of all of our citizens, regardless of their ethnicity. Then \u2013 and only then \u2013 will we really begin to make the past the past, even here in the South. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Dan Pfeiffer is a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and served in the White House in a variety of roles, including communications director. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Dan Pfeiffer: As his second term heads toward its close, we're seeing a feistier, bolder Barack Obama He says the President hasn't fundamentally changed, but he has grown and can act more freely and fearlessly WTF? That\u2019s exactly what the political world has been asking since President Barack Obama went to a garage in Los Angeles to record a podcast aptly named WTF and used a word rarely spoken in public by anyone, least of all a president. But that moment is just one in a series over the past six months or so where the famously reserved Barack Obama has seemed more liberated, feistier, bolder and sometimes rawly emotional. So what\u2019s changed? The answer, based on my eight years of working closely with President Obama, is both a lot and a little at the same time. Poll: Obama popularity on the upswing At his core, Barack Obama has not changed as a person. He is animated by the same values that led him to run for the presidency in the first place and he is still a very normal guy living a very abnormal life. On one of my last trips with the President, we variously talked about his family, Steph Curry\u2019s handle and the Republican presidential race \u2013 and tried to convince Valerie Jarrett that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was one of the best shows on television (despite the dragons). Obama: 'I know what I'm doing and I'm fearless' The distinction between the Obama of now and before is also somewhat overstated. In the first term, the President took bold, risky political steps to pass health care, save the auto industry and endorse marriage equality in the midst of a close re-election campaign. He was often feisty, calling out Republicans and sparring with some in his party. And he was often emotional in private and in public as he helped the nation heal after tragedies at Newtown and Tucson. But there is no question that something has felt different as the President has entered the twilight of his presidency, or as he calls it, the fourth quarter (One thing that stays consistent in the Obama era is sports metaphors). Obama shuts down White House heckler: \u2018You\u2019re in my house!\u2019 The first factor is clearly experience. Presidents are human, they change and grow with experience like the rest of us. Barack Obama has lived for six and a half years in a white hot crucible of pressure and scrutiny. Making life or death decisions at a moment\u2019s notice and literally carrying the weight of the world on one\u2019s shoulders affects a person in ways more profound that graying hair. I saw the President grow and change with experience. Over time, he (and all of us who worked for him) worked to separate the signal from the noise, so that he could focus more on the things that matter where he could have an impact instead of the faux crisis du jour in Washington. The second factor is fearlessness. Most of the focus on the President\u2019s recent interview was on his use of a racial slur to make a point, but he also gave the most frank and honest explanation about how he has changed during his years in the White House. He told interviewer Marc Maron that the experience has made him a better President. He said \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m fearless. It\u2019s all happened. I\u2019ve been through this, I\u2019ve screwed up, I\u2019ve been in the barrel tumbling down Niagara Falls, and I emerged, and I lived. And that\u2019s such a liberating feeling.\u201d Obama intentionally uses N-word on podcast Near-death political experiences have been a staple of Barack Obama\u2019s career. The campaign was almost over when we lost New Hampshire in 2008. His health care law was proclaimed dead a half dozen times before he signed it. And he suffered two brutal midterm electoral setbacks each of which could have effectively ended his presidency. Each of these made the President bolder \u2013 more fearless as he said \u2013 and therefore a better President. The final factor that has driven this shift is the ticking clock. The viral presidency: Obama\u2019s best unscripted moments The day after the 2014 midterm elections, he didn\u2019t skulk into the office. He walked in with a determined look and a little bit of a swagger. He told us that he was going to maximize every second of every one of his remaining two years. He said we would never again in our lives have the opportunity to do as much good for as many people as we had right then, and he didn\u2019t want to get on the plane back to Chicago in January of 2017 knowing that there was something he could have done to help people that he didn\u2019t do because of politics. Obama hasn\u2019t changed so much as grown into a President who takes decisive action, uses all the tools at his disposal and says and does things without fear of failure or political repercussions.

Some GOP candidates express support for flag's removal Monday, following Gov. Nikki Haley's lead Dean Obeidallah: GOP candidates fear political fallout for voicing opinions Until South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds on Monday, the leading 2016 GOP presidential candidates refused to do the same. Why? Most claimed it was an issue for the people of South Carolina. Conversely, many of these same candidates had no qualms chiming in with their support of \u201creligious liberty\u201d laws in other states, such as Indiana, that played well with their base. Over the weekend we saw a lack of courage from the 2016 GOP presidential field. On Sunday, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee refused to call for the removal of the Confederate flag, instead commenting that it\u2019s an \u201cissue for the people of South Carolina.\u201d Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum echoed Huckabee\u2019s sentiments. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz further declared that South Carolinians don\u2019t need \u201cpeople from outside of the state coming in and dictating how they should resolve it.\u201d Shooting reignites Confederate flag debate Even Jeb Bush, who ordered the Confederate flag to be removed from the Florida state capitol grounds in 2001 when he was governor there, refused Saturday to call for South Carolina to follow suit. Instead, he called this a \u201csensitive time,\u201d and said he hoped the people of the state would \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d And Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is expected to announce his formal entry into the presidential race in July and is third in the polls, on Saturday also deferred to local officials in South Carolina to have a \u201chealthy debate\u201d on the issue. Walker even went further, adding that, \u201cBefore I or anyone else weighs in\u201d on the flag issue, we should wait a week or two to \u201chonor the dead.\u201d Gov. Haley: Time to move Confederate flag Well, all that changed on Monday after Haley\u2019s call for the flag to be taken down. Walker no longer had to wait for weeks to express his views. Instead, he immediately tweeted he was \u201cglad\u201d Haley called for the Confederate flag to come down, stating, \u201cI support her decision.\u201d We saw similar praise from Bush, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Huckabee. Also, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is running for president, stood beside Haley at the press conference Monday in a show of support. Yet we still haven\u2019t seen a change in reaction from other leading Republican presidential candidates such as Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who co-sponsored legislation when he was a member of the Florida state legislature to keep the Confederate flag flying on the statehouse\u2019s grounds. Rubio said Saturday that he is also leaving the decision to the people of South Carolina, and on Monday applauded Haley \u201cfor her leadership at this difficult time\u201d while continuing to avoid giving his own opinion. So why have some of these Republicans changed their position? Simple \u2013 they feared the political fallout, and Haley\u2019s announcement offered them cover. Keep in mind that South Carolina is an important state in the GOP primaries, with its primary less than two weeks after the nation\u2019s first primary contest in New Hampshire. And in this decidedly \u201cred\u201d state, a November 2014 poll found that 61% of South Carolina residents support flying the flag, with the racial breakdown unsurprisingly being 73% of whites in favor and 61% of blacks opposed. (A 2013 national poll found that 56% of Republicans responded that the flag was not about racism, but \u201cSouthern pride.\u201d) Confederate flag: A symbol of hate or history? These candidates are also undoubtedly aware of what happened to Republican David Beasley, the last South Carolina governor to call for the removal of the flag. He did so in late 1996 after a series of racial incidents in the state, including arsonists intentionally burning down black churches. Beasley lost his 1998 re-election, with many attributing the loss in part to his advocating for the removal of the Confederate flag. This may explain why some of the GOP candidates have still remained silent. And let\u2019s be blunt, as The New York Times reported Monday, there has been a history of an alliance between some (not all) parts of the GOP in the South and groups that promote \u201cwhite primacy.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean Republican candidates in past years who solicited or accepted support from these groups are racist, but it at least appears they have sought the votes and financial backing of these far right groups. That is why we saw Rep. Steve Scalise \u2013 the third highest-ranking member in the House of Representatives \u2013 speak to a Louisiana white supremacist group in 2002 when seeking election to Congress. And Earl Holt III, the leader of the white supremacist group \u201cThe Council of Conservative Citizens\u201d that the Charleston shooter Dylann Roof cited in his manifesto, has donated over $50,000 to Republican candidates in recent years. (Holt\u2019s contributions to Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul are either being returned or donated to charity.) Notable Republicans have even addressed Holt\u2019s organization in the past, including former Republican Sen. Trent Lott and Huckabee. To be fair, in the past Democrats, too, have appealed to their own racist partisans. In the 1960s, many Southern Democrats, such as former South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And keep in mind that the Confederate flag was also first raised on the South Carolina state capitol in 1962 under Democratic Gov. Fritz Hollings in defiance of the civil rights movement. The removal of the Confederate flag is not a slam-dunk, given that it requires two-thirds of the South Carolina legislature\u2019s votes to pass. Let\u2019s hope the entire 2016 presidential field will show the same leadership as Haley and passionately make the case for why the Confederate flag \u2013 along with the mentality that supports it \u2013 should only be found in a museum, along with other relics of a time that has long passed.

A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \u201cCooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is calling for a new standard: a minimum of 20 early voting days Brazile: GOP contenders, in contrast, have proven they are not concerned with minority voting rights Hillary Clinton is speaking Thursday in Texas about the importance of protecting and expanding the constitutional right to vote for all citizens of the United States. Clinton will also call for a new national standard of \u201cno fewer than 20 days of early in-person voting, including weekend and evening voting.\u201d It has been 50 years since the historic march led by John Lewis, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights activists from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, Alabama, protesting voting restrictions used against African-Americans who wanted to exercise their right to vote. It was only a few months later, on August 6, 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act to end all barriers to political participation for racial and ethnic minorities, once and for all. While a great deal of progress has been made over the years, today, we face new challenges to those who are eligible to vote, and some of the leading culprits of erecting barriers are running for president. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone that Republicans are imposing new restrictions on the right to vote \u2013 restrictions that disproportionally affect African-Americans, Latinos, working Americans, seniors and America\u2019s youth \u2013 the very groups the Voting Rights Act was formed to protect. It is because of these restrictions that we must continue to march for the right of all eligible citizens to exercise their right to vote. We march because the right to have one\u2019s voice heard in this country is embodied in our Constitution, and in the spirit of our democracy. That\u2019s the fundamental difference between Democrats and the current GOP presidential field. As Democrats, we believe in the right of every eligible citizen to vote and have that vote counted; we are fighting to expand and protect the right to vote, while Republicans are doing just the opposite. Many of the Republican presidential hopefuls would make it more difficult for people to cast their ballots because they believe that is their party\u2019s best path to victory, to have a smaller electorate with fewer minority voters. While a small number of Republicans have worked to restore protections to voting rights struck down by the Supreme Court, too many of them support laws that prevent people who disagree with them from participating in the electoral process. Jeb Bush has a long history of opposing basic voting rights, calling for more stringent voter ID laws and signing into law legislation that restricted the hours and locations for early voting. And let\u2019s not forget when the Jeb Bush administration purged 12,000 eligible voters from the Florida voter rolls ahead of the 2000 presidential election, and attempted a similar voter purge ahead of the 2004 election. Republican hopeful, Sen. Marco Rubio also supported voter ID laws. While on the campaign trail for Mitt Romney, Rubio stated his support for these laws, saying \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? What is the big deal?\u201d Well according to the Brennan Center for Justice, the \u201cbig deal\u201d is that more than 11% of eligible voters  lack government-issued identification. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry also signed legislation to make Texas voter ID laws stricter. Even though Texans were already required to bring an ID with them to the polls, the new law would have required them to bring a photo ID. The Department of Justice blocked the law, stating that it violated the Voting Rights Act and disproportionately affected Hispanic voters. Sen. Ted Cruz, son of a Cuban immigrant, introduced federal legislation that would have required voters to present \u201cproof of citizenship\u201d before casting their ballots in elections for federal office. This measure would have amended the National Voter Registration Act. Sen. Rand Paul claims he is the single GOP candidate qualified to broaden his party\u2019s appeal to constituencies they normally ignore.  But when asked about the need to strengthen the Voting Rights Act, Paul suggested it wasn\u2019t necessary because \u201cwe have an African-American president.\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed into law a piece of legislation that slashed early voting and ended same-day registration in the state. The Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s editorial board even said the legislation was \u201ca breathtaking bid to suppress voting despite constitutional guarantees of voting rights.\u201d And then there\u2019s Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has arguably the worst record among the GOP\u2019s potential candidates in terms of voting rights. In 2010, Walker enacted one of the most restrictive voter ID laws in the country that also cut the early voting period from 30 to 12 days, eliminated weekend and evening voting, and required proof of residence when registering to vote, along with many other strict provisions. To no one\u2019s surprise, lawsuits were filed in recent weeks maintaining that Ohio and Wisconsin laws violated the Voting Rights Act. In Ohio, the lawsuit claimed that \u201chundreds of thousands of Ohioans will find it substantially more difficult to exercise\u201d their right to vote. In Wisconsin, the lawsuit was specifically filed against the voting laws passed under the Walker administration, claiming that the measures targeted \u201cAfrican-American, Latino, young, and/or Democratic voters in Wisconsin in particular.\u201d Clearly, these guys just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s time the GOP presidential candidates get behind one of their party\u2019s own elected officials, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, and others who want to fulfill the promise of the Constitution and protect everyone\u2019s right to vote. Listen, at the end of the day, the right to vote is sacred in this country, especially for the people who have fought so hard over the years to have their voices heard. When Republican lawmakers play politics and take that away, they silence the voices of so many across the country. I\u2019m glad Clinton is speaking out on this issue and, who knows, we might get a chance to hear from others before the end of the summer. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Raul Reyes: Senate candidate Loretta Sanchez heard making cell phone '\"joke\" about Native Americans. Not funny. She apologized He says ethnic minorities can be just as insensitive as others. Sanchez should have known better. Latinos must call out bigotry Oh no she didn\u2019t.  Over the weekend, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-California, landed in hot water when she used a stereotypical \u201cwar cry\u201d to refer to Native Americans.  Speaking at a California Democratic Party convention in Anaheim, Sanchez was attempting to draw a distinction between Native Americans and Indian-Americans.  \u201cI\u2019m going to his office,\u201d she said, referring to a supporter, \u201cthinking I\u2019m going to meet with a woo-woo-woo-woo, right? \u2018Cause he said \u2018Indian-American.\u201d The ad-libbed remark was captured on cell phone video and quickly went viral.  After initially dodging reporters who questioned her about the comment, Sanchez apologized late Sunday afternoon. This gaffe reminds us of a few uncomfortable truths: Members of minority groups can be just as insensitive as others when it comes to race and ethnicity \u2013 and this goes for Democrats as well as Republicans.  We Latinos need to be just as vigilant about calling out bigotry in our own community as we are about decrying it in others.  And Sanchez simply ought to know better than to speak off-the-cuff in such a self-destructive way. Native Americans constitute just 1.7% of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, or about 5.2 million people.  These relatively small numbers do not mean they are any less deserving of respect than, say, African-Americans or Latinos. The ongoing controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins shows the public is becoming more aware of what is offensive to Native Americans.  But Native Americans still have a long way to go toward winning full respect from our society.  Last year, an ESPN poll found that a clear majority of Americans did not want to change the name of the Washington Redskins, despite the fact that \u201cRedskins\u201d is a dictionary-defined slur. In 2012, supporters of then-Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts made \u201ctomahawk chops\u201d at rallies to taunt Elizabeth Warren for her Native American heritage.  Sanchez\u2019s casual mocking of Native Americans only plays into this misguided notion that it is acceptable to make a joke of Native American identity. Boehner pins border crisis on Obama Sanchez is certainly not the first Hispanic to make offensive remarks about other racial or ethnic groups.  In March, longtime Univision personality Rodner Figueroa was rightfully fired for making a racist comment about Michelle Obama on air.  Like Sanchez, he, too, was apparently making an attempt at humor.  Instead they both offended others and humiliated themselves. Given that she is running for office in one of the most diverse states in the nation, Sanchez\u2019s remark shows especially poor judgment.  Yet this is not her first brush with self-inflicted controversy.  In a 2010 interview on Spanish-language TV, she stated that, \u201cthe Vietnamese are after my seat\u201d (a reference to her Vietnamese-American political opponent at the time).  During the 2000 Democratic National Convention, she scheduled a fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion, only to move it later when fellow Democrats objected to what one news report called \u201cthe potentially sexist scenery.\u201d  With this latest firestorm, Sanchez is opening herself to criticism that she is not senator material. 'This is a rush' to war That is unfortunate, because she has impressive credentials.  She is the first Latina elected to Congress from Orange County, California.  She has championed the rights of immigrants, working women and military families.  Now these accomplishments have been overshadowed by a few seconds of thoughtlessness. That Sanchez was speaking informally doesn\u2019t make it alright.  Consider that her audience, many of whom were Indian-Americans, seemed to sense right away that her comments were ill-advised.  Or that in 2006, then-Sen. George Allen, R-Virginia, saw his bid for re-election collapse in part due to the outrage over his use of a racist slur in public. As an elected official, Sanchez should be held to a higher standard of behavior than others.  Besides, as a politician in our digital age, she should recognize that nearly all her public remarks will likely be recorded and disseminated via the press and social media. Loretta Sanchez has unwittingly provided her fellow politicians and public figures with two important reminders:  All Americans deserve respect.  And racism and bigotry are not acceptable \u2013 no matter what their source. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sherrilyn Ifill is the president of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Sherrilyn Ifill: A city with a pattern of racial discrimination elected two new black candidates to its city council Tuesday She says Ferguson faces other changes, too, that  should spur rethinking in working class suburbs across America Change is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination. It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town\u2019s dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change? The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time. Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \u201ca collection agency\u201d \u2013 one that preyed disproportionately on the town\u2019s African-American residents. The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \u201cno racial issues\u201d in his department. Ferguson\u2019s ugly, racist emails released The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn\u2019t find reason to prosecute.) Without question, change is coming to the town\u2019s government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson\u2019s most powerful official and, until the DOJ\u2019s blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city\u2019s deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black. Ferguson\u2019s hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest. Jackson\u2019s departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson. But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice\u2019s full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department. Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county \u2013 including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall \u2013 community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process. Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.. The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department. But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson\u2019s governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States. That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance. In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson\u2019s residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country. Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout \u2013 although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do. It\u2019s not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It\u2019s precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high. Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson\u2019s example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.

Brown is a professor of law at Emory University\u2019s School of Law and author of \u201cCritical Race Theory: Cases, Materials, and Problems.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Dorothy Brown: Ferguson political system has been effective at oppressing majority It has done so with the timing and type of elections, Brown says Brown: Fines filled city coffers; black citizens have been remarkably patient, but no more If you were the member of a minority group and tried to create a system to control and oppress the majority, you could not have done a better job than the white leaders of Ferguson, Missouri. Let\u2019s start with the demographics. Ferguson is small \u2013 roughly 20,000 residents \u2013 and is 67% black and 29% white. Over the past decade, Ferguson\u2019s population has changed from majority white to majority black. Its elected officials did not. Five of six City Council members are white, as is the city\u2019s mayor. How does this happen in a city two-thirds black? Two answers: timing of elections and type of elections. Ferguson, like most municipalities, holds elections in April of odd-numbered years. However research shows that such \u201coff-cycle\u201d elections reduces voter turnout. Ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections, which means that there are no party labels on the ballot. This not only reduces the likelihood that people will vote, it also has been shown to reduce what voters know about the candidates. Ferguson protests across U.S. Although Missouri does not track the race of its voters, according to an article in The Washington Post, Catalist, a private voter data firm, performed a study and found that the voting rules operating in Ferguson effectively suppress the black vote. In the national election in November 2012, the study found, voter turnout between blacks (54%) and whites (55%) was virtually identical. But because of the vast racial differences in the city\u2019s population, it resulted in an electorate that was 71% black and 28% white. Fast-forward five months later in April, when whites were three times (17%) more likely to vote than blacks (6%). That resulted in an electorate that was majority white: 52% versus 47%. That is how a majority-black population winds up with almost all-white elected representatives. Ferguson's history of racial divisions Ferguson\u2019s law enforcement officers are also not representative, with roughly 94% of its police force being white. Similarly Ferguson\u2019s local judges are nonrepresentative. I\u2019m sensing a pattern here. Local judges are appointed by the Ferguson City Council upon nomination by the mayor for a two-year term. The Ferguson Municipal Court is also all-white. But the black citizens of Ferguson apparently keep the police and local judges very busy. In 2013, Ferguson had the highest number of warrants issued in the state, when you control for size: 3.6 pending arrest warrants per household and 2.2 arrest warrants on average per person. And 95% of people arrested for jaywalking in Ferguson are black. While 67% of the population is black, 86% of vehicle stops involve a black driver. Holder: Law enforcement in Ferguson used for revenue While 29% of the population is white, 12.9% of vehicle stops involve a white driver. Blacks were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites, even though searches of blacks were less likely than whites to result in contraband being found (21% vs. 34%). Nobody said racism made sense. But for Ferguson, it has made money. In prior years Ferguson tried to raise sales tax but learned the hard way that it did not result in increased revenue because people voted with their feet and took their wealth with them. Ferguson turned to a different revenue source: collecting traffic fines and penalties from the largely black population. Those revenues constitute Ferguson\u2019s second-highest revenue source. Once a resident gets a ticket and does not appear in court with an explanation, an arrest warrant is likely issued. Once arrested, the resident may sit in jail for a very long time, while the fees and fines continue to accrue. A class-action lawsuit filed this month against the city of Ferguson has challenged this funding system, calling it a \u201cmodern debtors\u2019 prison scheme.\u201d The remarkable part of this story is how patient the black residents of Ferguson have been. It took the death of a teenager to get them mad enough to protest and the nation got mad with them. Between the class-action lawsuit and the Department of Justice\u2019s involvement, blacks in Ferguson should know the world is watching. The arc of history is long and bends towards justice \u2013 and help is finally on the way. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Tuesday marks the first city election since protests erupted in Ferguson, Missouri Depending on turnout, the City Council could change dramatically Ferguson is 70% black, but five of six council members are white The Rev. Tommie Pierson has a special message for his flock on Easter. It centers, of course, on Christ\u2019s resurrection, but it\u2019s also about the rising of a city that found itself drowning in despair, anger and frustration. \u201cFerguson, wake up,\u201d he roars from the pulpit at Greater St. Mark Family Church. \u201cIf it\u2019s business as usual on Tuesday, we will know Ferguson fell asleep.\u201d Starting at 6 in the morning Tuesday, Ferguson residents will be able to vote in a City Council election that many here say serves as a critical test of how this beleaguered city will move forward. The vote comes after months of protests over white police Officer Darren Wilson\u2019s August killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. In November, a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson. Then in March, the U.S. Department of Justice made public a scathing report that said the Ferguson Police Department and the city\u2019s municipal court engaged in systemic discrimination against African-Americans. Few black people are surprised by the DOJ findings. They already knew anecdotally what was happening, they say. Others in Ferguson say the DOJ conducted a witch hunt. Among the critics of the DOJ report is Mayor James Knowles III, who says he is frustrated by \u201cskewed data\u201d and \u201cunfair conclusions.\u201d \u201cThey had a hypothesis, and they were out to prove it instead of the facts leading them to a conclusion,\u201d Knowles says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we couldn\u2019t have done things better.\u201d After the report, three employees who sent racist emails were fired, and the city manager, John Shaw, was forced to resign. The courts appointed a new municipal judge; police Chief Tommy Jackson resigned, and Knowles came under pressure to step down, too, although he has resisted. In that sense, Ferguson has already started to clean house. But now it has a chance to alter the face of its local government further. Much of America will be watching a small-town vote that normally would draw little fanfare. But then again, no one ever mentioned Ferguson in the same breath as Selma before. Ferguson had become another landmark moment in America\u2019s civil rights movement. Even though Ferguson is 70% black, the City Council, like the police department, is overwhelmingly white. Only one of the six council members is African-American. Ferguson has three wards with two council members elected from each, but elections are staggered by years. Three council members \u2013 including the lone African-American \u2013 and Knowles, who also sits on the council, are not up for re-election this year. In many ways, residents say, Tuesday\u2019s contest pits the old Ferguson against the new \u2013 establishment vs. change. Among the people attending Easter service at Pierson\u2019s church is Bobby Smith, a self-described \u201cblack revolutionary\u201d who has been working with Ferguson youth after Brown\u2019s death. \u201cYou can only protest and demonstrate for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need voter education, which will lead to registration and the ultimate goal: voter participation. When I really get the attention of young people is when I tell them: \u2018Hey, you can have your own police chief.\u2019 \u201d Smith is one of many at Sunday\u2019s church service who is hopeful things will change. For years, many black Ferguson voters adopted an attitude that their participation didn\u2019t matter. Turnout in the 2013 municipal election was 17% for whites and 6% for blacks. Last year\u2019s city election drew a dismal 13% of registered voters to the polls. But Brown\u2019s death has helped motivate several candidates who say they are running to bring change to Ferguson. Eight candidates \u2013 four of them black \u2013 are running for three vacancies on the council. Brown\u2019s killing is also a reason that people might actually to go to the polls this time, Pierson says. \u201cThere is a growing number of people who realize now that had they participated in the process all along, that perhaps Michael Brown would be alive today,\u201d says Pierson, who in addition to leading his church represents a Missouri state House district just east of Ferguson. \u201cHigh turnout? I\u2019m praying for that to be reality because if it is not, then much of our work has been in vain.\u201d Reginald Rounds gets out his clipboard and a bottle of an electric blue energy drink before he begins walking through a leafy Ward 2 neighborhood filled with brick ranch-style houses. The man he is supporting is Bob Hudgins, a newcomer to politics. \u201cI\u2019ll be blunt with you,\u201d Rounds says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get candidates in place who can relate to the people. Bob is adamant about police reform.\u201d Hudgins attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. He likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to use my white privilege to break down what\u2019s happening here to white folks,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s such a waste of human potential here. Young black people are held back because of the system.\u201d Rounds has a neighborhood map and a list of registered voters identified by the Hudgins campaign as potential supporters. He starts his walking route on Olympia Drive. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Rounds says to Guan Pickett, working inside his garage. \u201cAre you planning to vote Tuesday?\u201d The two men talk. Eventually Rounds asks whether Pickett would consider voting for Hudgins. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with him,\u201d Pickett says. \u201cBut I know one thing. I\u2019m not going to vote for Brian Fletcher.\u201d Rounds likes what he hears. He believes Fletcher is too entrenched with the old guard to make tangible changes for people of color. Fletcher, who is also white, is a former mayor of Ferguson. He has 28 years of political experience in various roles. Ferguson racist emails released \u201cI decided it was important that someone with experience be elected,\u201d Fletcher says in an interview. \u201cWe have three councilmen leaving. Someone with a calm head needed to be on the council.\u201d Fletcher\u2019s supporters, like Joyce Strain, 67, repeat two things about him: that he has a lot of political experience and that he started the \u201cI Love Ferguson\u201d campaign. The group raised thousands of dollars in T-shirt and other swag sales to donate to mom-and-pop business owners who lost money because of the vandalism that occurred during some of the protests. \u201cI like the way Fletcher handled himself through all that,\u201d Strain tells Rounds at her doorstep. \u201cHave a good day,\u201d Rounds tells her as he makes note that she is a \u201cdefinite\u201d supporter of Fletcher. His quota today is to get 11 people to say \u201cyes.\u201d So far, he only has one definite, Pickett. But the day is still early and there is not a cloud in the sky. How 'hands up, don't shoot' spread \u201cI\u2019m just a foot soldier for the cause,\u201d says Rounds, 58. He used to live on Canfield Drive \u2013 the road where Brown\u2019s body lay for four hours last summer \u2013 until he got better affordable housing elsewhere. After Brown was killed, he joined the protests and got involved as an organizer. He works with a liberal coalition formed by the Working Families Party, the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment. It\u2019s too late to register people to vote, but Rounds offers those who plan to vote for Hudgins a ride to the polls. One of them is Claudette Neil, 75, and a great-grandmother who points to her maroon sedan filled with stuffed animals. \u201cDo you see my car out there? I can still drive,\u201d she tells Rounds before giving him a mouthful about the lack of discipline these days. Parents and schools need to give kids old-fashioned whoopings if they are ever to learn good behavior, she says. That\u2019s how her generation was raised. \u201cThe looting and shooting and carrying on is just ridiculous,\u201d she says. She thinks the violence that broke out was counterproductive and just made the white establishment even more resistant to change. \u201cWhat are they trying to do? Take us back to slavery?\u201d Rounds nods his head. \u201cSo I can put you down for voting for Hudgins?\u201d he asks. Neil responds in the affirmative. \u201cYou have a good day, Ms. Neil,\u201d Rounds says. He\u2019s one more closer to his quota. Wesley Bell hops out of his pale-green Range Rover near Canfield Drive. He is out here to knock on apartment doors and persuade people to vote for him. The predominantly black residents of Ward 3, where Bell is running, will have a black City Council member representing them for the first time regardless of who wins. It will be either Bell, a 40-year-old lawyer and criminal justice professor, or Lee Smith, a 76-year-old retiree. Besides being black and strong advocates of reform, the two men could not be more different. Bell is a part-time municipal judge, and as such he says he knows how the courts operate. He says he is precisely the kind of person Ferguson needs at this critical juncture. He hands out fliers to voters that lay out his platform. On the top of his agenda is community policing. He remembers how a police officer played football with him when he was a kid. How he grew up to trust that officer. He wants a return to those days. He wants black boys in Ferguson to turn into black men who are comfortable with law enforcement. And he wants officers to get to know the people they are supposed to be protecting. \u201cI\u2019ve been preaching that for years.\u201d Bell says. \u201cI\u2019m running because I see this as an opportunity to set a broad example to the world. It takes people in the community to step up.\u201d Bell moved into brand new loft housing in the trendiest patch of Ferguson when he started teaching at a nearby community college. On Friday night, he showed up for a blues show across the street from his home. But he\u2019s just as comfortable walking Canfield Drive. His supporters, too, run the gamut from affluent lawyers to working-class families who view him as a black man who succeeded in life. \u201cLook and listen to the people,\u201d Elainna Hudson tells Bell, \u201cbecause we live here.\u201d Bell says he gets it. \u201cLast time I checked, politics is supposed to be about helping people.\u201d But Bell\u2019s critics say he is a part of the system and, therefore, part of the problem. Someone has been distributing a flier that links Bell to Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor who oversaw the Darren Wilson grand jury investigation. \u201cAt least it\u2019s a nice picture of me,\u201d he says, stuffing it into the left back pocket of his jeans. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a lazy argument,\u201d he says of the flier. \u201cA German pilot flew a plane into a mountain. Are we going to say all pilots are bad now?\u201d Maybe not, but many in Ward 3 say they don\u2019t trust Bell. They want \u201cone of them\u201d on the council. And that\u2019s Lee Smith. Born the son of an Arkansas sharecropper, Smith is old enough to remember the terrifying days of Jim Crow. One time, he says, white men put a gun to his gut and forced him to watch them beat his father to a pulp. Then they threw father and son in jail without medical attention. All because he and his father had demanded that the landowner they worked for pay them the $700 they had earned. \u201cGuess what our fine was to get out of jail?\u201d Smith says. \u201c$700.\u201d When he turned 18, Smith left rural Arkansas for the bright lights of St. Louis. He arrived with a chip on his shoulder as \u201cbig as this house,\u201d he says, standing in the living room of the home he bought for $44,000 in 1988. Over the years, he worked his way up through various jobs as a supply clerk and forklift operator and became the president of the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. He retired from a job at Westinghouse Electric when the plant closed in 1990. He says music soothed his soul and helped him get over his anger at white people. Now he wants to change the system. \u201cI decided to run in December after the grand jury decision was announced,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone else stepping forward to try and make change.\u201d He admits he is inexperienced in politics but says he has something far more important. \u201cI can be a good advocate for people who are hurting because I know what it feels like. This particular ward has been neglected, and it will stop with me.\u201d Adrienne Hawkins, 46, a federal employee and a mother of twin boys, was never politically active. Until Michael Brown died. She walked from her house, a half a block away from Canfield Drive, to watch as police fired tear gas at protesters and helicopters whirred overhead. \u201cWhen all this happened, I realized I had to save more than my two boys,\u201d she says. So at a community reconciliation meeting last fall, she stood up for the first time and expressed her anger over the state of public schools in Ferguson. A few months later, she filed to run for City Council. \u201cI have never seen anybody correct a problem they won\u2019t acknowledge,\u201d she says. Some city officials \u201care not even willing to acknowledge there\u2019s a problem here. That\u2019s always the elephant in the room.\u201d Hawkins is one of two black women \u2013 the other is Ella Jones \u2013 vying against two white men \u2013 Mike McGrath and Doyle McClellan \u2013 for the City Council post in Ward 1. Some Ferguson voters say they view the two men as representing the old Ferguson. Part of that stems from the comments they\u2019ve made. On his website, McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College, says he loves small-town living in Ferguson. He calls the DOJ report statistically flawed and unverified. \u201cThe document is a plaintiff\u2019s view of Ferguson, and it ignores favorable data to make its case,\u201d he says. He says the city should implement the DOJ-recommended changes but adds that city employees were humiliated by the federal investigation. \u201cMuch of what is in the report no longer reflects their priorities or practices. Let\u2019s judge our city employees by their performance and dedication since August,\u201d his  website says. McGrath has been involved with Ferguson politics for a long time, serving on various boards and commissions. At a recent candidate forum, he said he did not think he would be hurt by his status quo image and said calls for change were coming from a vocal minority. He was quoted in The Huffington Post as saying the DOJ \u201cwent after the city\u201d because it couldn\u2019t get Darren Wilson. He also said black residents who live in apartment complexes don\u2019t care as much about Ferguson as do homeowners. \u201cI may be a silly old man in all of this, but I don\u2019t think we have a big race issue here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an issue with that part of town and they\u2019ve been a bad part of town for a long time, sadly.\u201d Jones, a longtime sales director at Mary Kay cosmetics, is president of the Ferguson Township Open Democratic Club and serves on the Ferguson Human Rights Commission. She says she has been involved with the community for more than two decades and can be a salve for a community in pain. Jones or Hawkins, if either one wins, would become the first black woman to serve on Ferguson\u2019s City Council. The Easter service at Pierson\u2019s church draws to a close with inspiring gospels. The entire sanctuary is rocking. Afterward, members venture out for ham dinners with their families. Many say they are planning to vote. Turnout will be key Tuesday. If Ferguson\u2019s majority-black population stays at home, candidates such as Hawkins, Jones and Hudgins won\u2019t have much of a chance, political observers say. But if they do vote, Ferguson\u2019s City Council could end up with three black members and a white guy who protested on the streets. \u201cThey will understand they need to make positive change,\u201d Pierson says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have pockets of poverty filled with people who are over-policed.\u201d All the candidates talk about economic development. They talk about building a community that\u2019s pleasant to live in. Everyone wants to fix up the West Florissant Avenue corridor, looted and burned in November. But making it all happen is another thing. Just around the corner from Pierson\u2019s church stand reminders of all that went wrong in Ferguson. Damaged and burned buildings remain as the scars of the war that took place on the streets. The QT gas station is just as it was the day after Brown\u2019s death many months ago: charred and mangled. But on this day, on Easter, Pierson sends the congregation home with another thought. Outside, the trees that slept all winter are bursting with buds, he tells them. They are signs of new life. He urges his flock to follow their lead, wake from their slumber \u2013 and help Ferguson start anew. Follow CNN\u2019s Moni Basu on Twitter.",

            "article_content": "There is persistent chatter that Joe Biden might challenge Hillary Clinton But Clinton is seen as the only Democrat who can win in 2016 She\u2019s staring down the worst polling numbers of her campaign, struggling to overcome the scandal surrounding her private emails and grappling with persistent chatter that Vice President Joe Biden might challenge her. But Hillary Clinton has one key advantage going into primary season: A firm perception that she\u2019s the only Democrat who can keep the White House. \u201cExcept for Hillary who is there?\u201d said Brent Budowsky, a Democratic insider who worked for party luminaries including former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. \u201cThere is really no one else at this moment who has a chance of winning. That is a problem that Democrats face \u2013 that is the problem progressives face. He added: \u201cIf for some reason she dropped out, there would be chaos.\u201d As progressives swoon for Bernie Sanders and Biden allies float trial balloons and even rumors of an Al Gore comeback swirl, Budowsky\u2019s sentiment points to the reality at the heart of Clinton\u2019s 2016 efforts. While grassroots Democrats might not love the former secretary of state, who often seems to the right of the party\u2019s increasingly liberal base, they appear ready to make a pragmatic choice that she is their best \u2013 or only \u2013 hope on Election Day. READ: Hillary Clinton pitches scholarship, on-campus child care options Though her lead has narrowed in some instances, Clinton is still on top of most polls of Democratic primary voters. And she beats potential Republican nominees in most match-up surveys. But it is clear, two months after her announcement speech packed with populist themes on New York\u2019s Roosevelt Island, that Clinton is a long way from closing the deal with her party\u2019s truest believers. Politico reported Friday that there\u2019s a greater degree of strategizing by Biden\u2019s advisers, but not Biden himself and that the vice president could skip Iowa and New Hampshire and focus solely on South Carolina. Such is the power and aura of the Clinton family that few Democrats will go on the record as criticizing the former first lady and many say they respect her and will ultimately support her if she is the nominee. But from multiple conversations with Democratic activists, it\u2019s clear that suspicion lingers over her true beliefs and instincts. Some fear, for instance, that she would prove to be more to the right of her current political position once in the White House. All the love in a party that tends to fall hard for its favored candidates is going to Sanders. And after all, there is a precedent \u2013 2008 \u2013 for Clinton\u2019s primacy as her party\u2019s apparently unassailable front runner being undermined by a grass roots revolt. New polls are adding to the jitters. A survey this week for the first time put Sanders in the lead in a key nominating state \u2013 New Hampshire \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s negative ratings continue to rise over the email controversy that has haunted her candidacy and looks set on to drag on for months, giving a torrent of material for the GOP to brand her secretive and shady. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign is hardly setting the party on fire either. She\u2019s failed so far to recapture the barnstorming persona which prolonged her battle against Barack Obama for the party nomination seven years ago. And Clinton often seems a ponderous campaigner \u2013 the undeniable connection she has with individuals does not translate easily to the campaign trail and she frequently suffers by comparison with the political magnetism of her husband \u2013 former president Bill Clinton. As she tries to prove that despite her wealth and life in the political bubble she\u2019s in touch with everyday Americans, Clinton\u2019s choice of campaign events also makes it hard to inspire. For instance, on Friday in Iowa, Clinton held a wonkish event on cutting college debt \u2013 part of an emerging attempt to lay a policy foundation under her presidential bid. Asked later about her repeated focus on mental health \u2013 one of the core of issues on which she likes to focus in depth \u2013 she was unapologetic. \u201cI think a president should try to help people have better lives,\u201d Clinton said, defending a strategy of narrowing in on issues that preoccupy everyday voters rather than big venue campaign events like the ones with which Sanders is packing out sports arenas. The former secretary of state has also sometimes seemed an uneasy fit with progressives in a party that has undeniably moved left since 2008. She\u2019s dodged taking a stand on issues that fire up the party base in united opposition like the Keystone XL pipeline and Obama\u2019s push for a pan-Pacific trade deal \u2013 a pact she supported as secretary of state. Some Democrats are increasingly worried following Clinton\u2019s handover to the Justice Department of the private server she used as secretary of state, which is at the center of a controversy over classified intelligence. There is so far no evidence that Clinton is the target of an investigation or could face criminal charges and her campaign says she never sent email with information that was classified at the time. But the latent fear of the unknown may be one reason why Clinton communications chief Jennifer Palmieri sent an email to the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s supporters this week assuring them the so-called scandal was mere campaign \u201cnonsense\u201d trumped up by Republicans. Some senior Democrats believe it\u2019s too early to push the panic button for Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s in the DNA of Democrats to worry and to freak out and a lot of folks out there are worrying and freaking out,\u201d said Mo Elleithee, who worked on Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign and now leads the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. \u201cGive it a couple of months. If the dynamics don\u2019t start to improve, then you start to worry but at this point there is no reason to worry.\u201d READ: Hillary Clinton snags key Iowa endorsement There\u2019s another reason why the Clinton campaign is unlikely be to raising the alarm over nervousness in party ranks. Despite Sanders\u2019 rise \u2013 he\u2019s basking in adulation and drawing huge crowds for a campaign based on blasting Wall Street, demanding campaign finance reform, free college, a battle against climate change and universal healthcare \u2013 many party insiders doubt America is ready to elect a 75-year-old self declared socialist as president. And while Biden is beloved in the party, stirs deep sympathy following the death of his son Beau from a brain tumor, and enjoys the stature of office, there are still questions about his electability. That\u2019s not stopping supporters of the vice president \u2013 who wrapped up his last presidential campaign in 2008 after barely registering in the Iowa causes \u2013 from laying the groundwork for a possible run. A draft Biden movement has kicked into high gear, drawing more donations and support, at a time when reports say Biden is considering whether there is a path to run in 2016. The group took in roughly $200,000 in the first quarter and has amassed almost 200,000 signatures. But, those figures pale next Clinton\u2019s $45 million haul and the 18 million votes she got in 2008. That current landscape is part of Biden\u2019s calculus as he mulls challenging Clinton. For the last week he has been vacationing in South Carolina and reaching out to supporters to gauge interest. \u201cIf he does decide to enter the race, he will add more gravitas to the Democratic field,\u201d said Jon Cooper, the national finance chairman or Draft Biden 2016.  \u201cHe has a strong capable hand and is ready to lead on day one without any learning curve.\u201d That decades long resume, however, could also be an Achilles heel as polls show that voters are pining for outsiders and fresh faces. Aside from Biden, the Democratic bench is scarcely populated by alternative power players. Two other Democrats in the race, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, might pose tricky moments for Clinton in Democratic debates. But they\u2019re the longest of long shot challengers. Meanwhile, the next generation of Democratic presidential possibles \u2013 like New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand \u2013 have yet to emerge, partly because of the prohibitive presence of Clinton as the heir apparent. READ: CNN / ORC Poll: Clinton remains strong in Iowa Any late entrants to the race at this stage would run headlong in to the Clinton machine. The campaign has quietly been building the kind of comprehensive grassroots voter identification structure in early states to swell her delegate count that she lacked in 2008. And she\u2019s consolidated her support among Democratic Party elites \u2013 a barometer of political strength that history suggests is just as important as polling in early states in the summer before nominating votes are cast. On Friday, Clinton trumpeted the latest significant endorsement, welcoming the support of former Sen. Tom Harkin, a liberal Iowa political icon. \u201cI have had the privilege of knowing Hillary Clinton for a long time. She and I share many of the same deeply-held beliefs,\u201d Harkin said, in a statement that may help insulate Clinton from claims she is aloof from the economic woes of many Americans. As often happens with Clinton, however, over a long political career marked by fierce fights with Republicans and questions about her trustworthiness, good news shares equal billing with unflattering headlines. It\u2019s that trend that has some Democrats worried, and looking with some trepidation towards Clinton\u2019s prospects in an eventual general election. READ: What\u2019s behind the Sanders surge? In July, a Quinnipiac University poll of three swing states\u2014Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia\u2014showed Clinton lagging behind possible GOP opponents, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.  As she has battled bad headlines about her personal e-mail account, her negative ratings have spiked in those states and her trust numbers have also taken a hit. A CNN/ORC poll of Democratic voters in Iowa released this week shows that Clinton still beats Sanders overall, yet voters see the Vermont Senator as more trustworthy. And since July, Sanders has attracted cumulative crowds of 100,000 people with his soak-the-rich rhetoric. \u201cHillary Clinton has been doing well in Iowa but her people there are rattled by the Bernie Sanders crowds which by Iowa standards are quite large,\u201d said David Yepsen, who has covered Iowa politics for decades. \u201cThe polls look good for her now but we are six months away and I\u2019ve seen things change rapidly. The drip, drip, drip, drip, is causing some concern.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As the lead U.S. nuclear negotiator going toe-to toe-with Iran, Wendy Sherman\u2019s colleagues had already labeled her an \u201ciron fist in a velvet glove\u201d and, more pointedly, \u201cbadass.\u201d But when an Iranian cartoon portrayed the silver-haired, stern and often intense Sherman as a fox, her staff started calling her the Silver Fox and had T-shirts made emblazoned with the words \u201cTeam Silver Fox.\u201d On one particularly rough morning in Vienna, as the negotiations were reaching the end game, Sherman wore the T-shirt to a meeting with her delegation and Secretary of State John Kerry. It was a badly-needed moment of comic relief for more than a dozen exhausted diplomats who had spent the better part of the last two years sitting at conference tables in European hotel rooms across from Iranian officials trying to hammer out a historic nuclear agreement. Having reached a deal and with Congress set to vote on it, Sherman announced Thursday she will leave the State Department in October for Harvard University \u201cThis job has been a privilege, but it\u2019s been a killer,\u201d she said in an interview Wednesday. In addition to leading the U.S. delegation for the Iran talks, Sherman traveled to more than 50 countries in her day job as undersecretary for political affairs. As the State Department\u2019s No. 3 official, she often traveled to places such as Libya, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan in between marathon negotiating sessions with the Iranians. \u201cThe last two years were a rollercoaster. The last four years have been the most intense of my life,\u201d she said. Her first career as a social worker and community organizer may seem like odd training for nuclear negotiations. But Sherman said she actually drew upon those experiences with her Iranian counterparts. Her \u201ccaseload\u201d may be more global, but she said the work is similar \u2013 involving the complex relationship and budding detente between Washington and Tehran, as well as managing a series of clients both inside and outside the meeting room. \u201cThat skill set came in handy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to see all the parts in front of you. You really learn how to understand people. \u201c Sherman had to maintain the unity of the P5+1 negotiating group, no easy feat with Russia and China appearing eager to accept a weaker agreement and France and Britain even more hardline at times than the United States. Add to that a series of countries not even taking part in the negotiations, but with strong vested interests, including Israel and Persian Gulf states. Most importantly, the negotiations involved complex and interlocking aspects of a heavily technical nuclear agreement, which is why she would often compare the negotiations to solving a \u201cRubik\u2019s Cube.\u201d \u201cI felt a tremendous responsibility leading this team, but I understood what we were trying to achieve,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were times I felt overwhelmed and guilty about not being home, but my husband would always remind me how historic it was what we were doing.\u201d Even before she took on the Iran file, Sherman was no stranger to high-stakes nuclear negotiations. As counselor to then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Sherman was at the table when the United States sought a deal with North Korea to curb the development and proliferation of Pyongyang\u2019s long-range missiles in exchange for substantial aid and civilian nuclear reactors. The deal was so far along that Sherman accompanied Albright on a historic trip to Pyongyang, the highest-level visit to North Korea by a U.S. official since the end of the Korean War. But the White house ended up canceling those negotiations because of the disputed U.S. presidential election of 2000 and the lack of time to follow up with the incoming administration. In March 2001, Sherman wrote an op-ed in The New York Times urging Clinton\u2019s successor, President George W. Bush, to continue negotiations. Instead, Bush cut off direct talks with Pyongyang, later joining a six-nation diplomatic process with North Korea. Following a 2006 nuclear test by Pyongyang, the so-called Six-Party Talks struck a deal for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for substantial aid and the lifting of U.S. sanctions. But the long-standing engagement with Pyongyang failed to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. In the 13 years since Albright and Sherman visited Pyongyang, North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and launched countless long-range missiles, and the program continues unabated. Critics have used the North Korea example as a lightening rod to criticize Sherman and the Obama administration\u2019s negotiations with Iran, arguing they were following a failed playbook and would be duped by Tehran, just as the Clinton administration was by Pyongyang. This time, Sherman was able to bring the high-stakes negotiations to a historic closure. \u201cI need some time to look back and absorb what we did,\u201d she said, adding that the euphoria her team felt when the deal was reached was quickly eclipsed by the enormity of the next herculean task at hand \u2013 selling the agreement to skeptical lawmakers. At Harvard, Sherman will jointly serve as an Institute of Politics resident fellow and senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs As a close confidante to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her name has surfaced as a possible Secretary of State herself were Clinton to win the White House in 2016. It was Clinton who drafted Sherman back to the State Department from the private sector when she headed it. Sherman said that although she may advise Clinton in an informal capacity in the future, she has no plans to join the campaign. \u201cLife comes in seasons,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be things I will miss, but I\u2019ve asked a lot of my family and friends. It\u2019s time to take a step back and figure out what I want to do next.\u201d With Sherman\u2019s departure, most of the top officials who negotiated with Iran, except for John Kerry, have now left the administration, leaving questions about who will shepherd implementation of the deal if it passes Congress. Having spent so many hours sitting across from the Iranians, Sherman said that she understands them better but is realistic about the potential for improved relations between the U.S. and Iran. \u201cIt is an opaque society. The level of mistrust is very profound and deep. I think we are taking baby steps, but I don\u2019t anticipate great movement right away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\u201d",

He is also a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a think tank based in New York, and co-founder of Friends of Democracy, a super PAC and advocacy organization dedicated to reducing the influence of money in politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Jonathan Soros, a political donor, says the financing of campaigns corrupts democracy He says recent elections in Maine and Seattle raise hope for public financing of campaigns Last Monday, I hosted a dinner with President Obama for 50 people to raise money for the House Democrats.  As host, I enjoyed the additional privilege of a few minutes in private with the President during which I pressed him, ironically, to take action on campaign finance reform.  Sorry, but I can\u2019t tell you how he replied. Part of the privilege is to hear the President off-the-record. Later in the week I hosted a smaller dinner for a candidate for the U.S. Senate.  Our common passion for campaign finance reform is such I could convince myself he was just there to anchor our thoughtful discussion, but there\u2019s only one reason New York is an essential campaign stop for candidates from all 50 states: money. The relentless demand for campaign funds grants those of us who provide the money extraordinary access to our elected leaders and candidates.  We can shape how candidates talk about an issue, influence what issues they might choose to highlight or ignore, and entice promises about what they will do in office. While I, and many other private donors on both the left and right, advocate for policies that we perceive to be in the public interest, our perspective is dramatically unrepresentative of the American electorate. Top political donors are overwhelmingly male, white, urban, and, of course, rich. More importantly, many other donors have only their self-interest in mind and give to curry favor with the lawmakers who can help or hurt their fortunes. Most members of Congress, who are dependent on this money for their re-election campaigns, have to listen. The American public understands this is a fundamental corruption of our political process.  And while I have worked to bend that process toward inclusion and transparency from the inside, voters have started to take matters into their own hands. In Maine and Seattle, meaningful bipartisan majorities voted last Tuesday to make the voters themselves, rather than an elite or self-interested few, the source of campaign funds. By a 55% to 45% vote, Maine voters renovated their landmark \u201cclean elections\u201d law that provides substantial campaign funds to candidates who raise a large number of small contributions, allowing ordinary citizens the opportunity to contest and win elections with the support of their peers. An earlier law for public funding of campaigns had been badly undermined by the U.S. Supreme Court  and constant raids of its funding. But having once enjoyed the opportunity to elect candidates that came from and represented their communities, Mainers reclaimed that right with their dramatic victory. Voters in Seattle passed an \u201chonest elections\u201d law that includes an innovation called \u201cDemocracy Vouchers.\u201d  Once implemented, every voter in Seattle will receive $100 in vouchers that can be used to support candidates for city office who voluntarily accept spending and contributions limits.  Because the vouchers will be sent automatically based on registration status, the new program has the opportunity to dramatically expand access to and participation in election financing. Despite attacks from local real estate interests that stand to lose much of the influence they have exerted over city government, the proposal passed by an unexpectedly strong margin of 63% to 37%. Though different in design and name, these new laws have in common the capacity to fundamentally upend the way campaigns are financed and diminish the influence of big donors and super PACs. Neither law eliminates super PACs, but it\u2019s easy to see how they become far less relevant (and perhaps even counterproductive) when candidates can fund their campaigns by appeal directly to their constituents. Maine and Seattle are only the beginning. Plans are already afoot to extend these victories to other states and municipalities and, by demonstrating the clear will of the American people to have representatives who work for them and not special interests, eventually to Congress. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve joked with people who know of my involvement with this work that the movement to reform campaign finance laws was making tremendous progress \u201cdespite all objective evidence to the contrary.\u201d  While there is still a long way to go, the progress is now manifest and the path clearer than ever. The American people want their democracy back, and they\u2019re going to get it. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation partnered to survey Americans on issues relating to race and ethnicity. The poll explores how things have changed in the last 20 years and what race means now. The survey also examines how different groups of Americans experience race day-to-day, and what they think about racism and the racial divisions that are so pervasive in our economic and political lives.  Here are five key findings from the CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey on race and reality. Overall, 49% of Americans in the poll say racism is a big problem in the country, up from 28% four years ago. It\u2019s also more than the 41% who said so 20 years ago, shortly after the Million Man March on the nation\u2019s capital. In the new poll, the percent of people who see racism as a big problem is higher among racial and ethnic minorities than it is among whites \u2013 66% of blacks and 64% of Hispanics call it a big problem, compared to 43% of whites. Women, particularly white and Hispanic women, are more apt to consider racism a problem than are men. And among whites, there\u2019s a broad political divide, with 56% of white Democrats calling it a big problem compared with 32% of white Republicans. But the age gaps that one might expect from an America whose demographics are shifting generationally do not materialize. Younger whites are about as likely as older whites to consider racism a big problem, and younger people of color are just as likely as their older peers to say it\u2019s a big problem. Almost two-thirds of Americans say racial tensions have increased in America in the last 10 years, much higher than the 29% who said so in 2001 and the 47% who felt that way in 1995. On this issue, there is agreement across racial and ethnic groups, with majorities of whites (67%), blacks (65%) and Hispanics (55%) all feeling tensions have grown in the last decade. That view is shared among young and old, male and female, Democrat and Republican, urban, suburban and rural. About the only statistically meaningful difference is that white conservatives are most likely to say tensions have grown (75%) in the last 10 years. At home, when socializing, and at work, white Americans report their lives are mostly spent around others of the same race. About seven in 10 whites say they live (69%) or socialize with (68%) people who are mostly of the same race as them, and six in 10 employed whites have co-workers who are mostly other white people (60%). Hispanics and blacks are more apt to report more diverse neighborhoods, social circles and workplaces. Non-Hispanic whites make up a majority of the American public, so that gap isn\u2019t entirely a surprise. But what\u2019s most notable about these results is that there\u2019s no significant difference between younger whites (18-45) and older whites (45-64) who say they socialize with, work with or live around people who are all/mostly the same race as them. Senior whites, however, are a different story. Those 65 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say they live near or socialize with those of the same race. Younger blacks and Hispanics, however, are far more likely to say they have diverse social circles and neighborhoods. Overall, about three-quarters of Americans say they think African-Americans (77%) or Hispanic-Americans (74%) face at least some discrimination in society today.   The poll results provide a measure of just how many people have faced what they consider to be unfair treatment on account of their race or ethnicity in everyday situations \u2013 at work, while shopping, at restaurants or the movies, while seeking health care or in dealings with police. Fifty-three percent of blacks report experiencing one of those types of unfair treatment in the last 30 days, as did 36% of Hispanics. Among whites, 15% say they\u2019ve dealt with such unfair treatment. More blacks say they experienced unfair treatment while shopping than in any of the five scenarios tested \u2013 33% reported an occasion like that. And blacks were least likely to report unfair treatment when seeking health care (12%). About a quarter of blacks say they experienced unfair treatment at work or in a restaurant, bar, theater or other entertainment venue. In dealing with police specifically, approximately one in five African-Americans and one in six Hispanics say they\u2019ve faced unfair treatment in the last 30 days, compared with 3% \u2013 or one in 30 \u2013 among whites. A majority of African-Americans say they or a close friend or family member have been incarcerated (55%), significantly higher than the share among whites (36%) or Hispanics (39%). For whites, the share saying they have been incarcerated themselves or have a close relationship with someone who has drops with education. Thirty percent of whites with college degrees say they, a family member or close friend have been incarcerated, compared with 40% among whites who do not have college degrees. For African-Americans and Hispanics, the numbers are similar across educational lines. The percentage of blacks who say they or someone they know have been incarcerated is particularly high among those who live in urban areas (60% vs. 48% among those who live in the suburbs or rural areas) and among younger African-Americans (62% among those age 18-34, 55% among those age 35-64 compared with 35% among black seniors). The CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll was conducted August 25-October 3, 2015, among a random national sample of 1,951 adults, including 501 black and 500 Hispanic respondents. Results for all groups have been adjusted to reflect their actual national distribution. Interviews were conducted on conventional telephones and cell phones, in English and Spanish, by SSRS of Media, Pennsylvania. This poll was jointly developed and analyzed by CNN and staff at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; for results based on African-Americans or Hispanics it is plus or minus 6 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "For the first time ever, Ferguson's City Council will be half black The two winning black candidates vowed to bring reform The election was a critical test in this beleaguered city The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. After months of turmoil and upheaval, months of frustration and anger, the beleaguered city has a new governing board. And it looks very different than the old one. Buoyed by a higher-than-normal 30% turnout, two African-American candidates won their wards Tuesday night to make the six-member City Council 50% black. Ferguson\u2019s population of about 21,000 is 70% black, but the City Council was predominantly white, as is the police force. Supporters of both candidates said that from the tragedy of a young black man\u2019s death, a new day dawned in Ferguson. Ella Jones screamed when her victory became official late Tuesday night. She won 49.76% of the vote. \u201cThank you, Ward 1. I love you,\u201d an emotional Jones said at a party held at Drake\u2019s restaurant. She will become the first black woman ever to sit on the Ferguson council. A post shared by Moni Basu (@evilreporterchick) But both Jones and Wesley Bell, who won the Ward 3 seat with nearly 67% of the vote, said they did not see their victories from a racial perspective. Jones, who resigned her job as a Mary Kay cosmetics sales director to run for office, said in her ward, she heard the same complaints from a 65-year-old black man as she did from his white peers. \u201cMy job is to be that catalyst so we can put a new face on Ferguson,\u201d she said. Bell, a lawyer and criminal justice professor, said, \u201cI\u2019m more interested in having quality on the council,\u201d when asked about the change in its racial makeup. He had made community policing his No. 1 priority and said he intends to be deeply involved with the hiring of a new police chief in this St. Louis suburb. The former chief, Tommy Jackson, resigned after a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report found systemic discrimination against African-Americans in law enforcement and the municipal court. Bell said he wants Ferguson\u2019s police officers to be judged by the number of people they know in the community, not by the number of tickets they issue. A post shared by Moni Basu (@evilreporterchick) One other seat was up for grabs in Ferguson. That was won by Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who launched the \u201cI Love Ferguson\u201d campaign to raise money for mom-and-pop businesses that were hurt by the violence and vandalism during the protests last fall. Fletcher beat his opponent, Bob Hudgins, with 56.7% of the vote. Fletcher told voters he was best suited for a City Council job despite his critics\u2019 claims that he was too entrenched in the old guard. \u201cI understand that feeling, but those individuals don\u2019t know me,\u201d he said. Fletcher said he had contacts with elected officials from his almost three decades in politics. That would be an invaluable asset in getting Ferguson back on its feet, he said. The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June, and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. \u201cThat amount will drop significantly,\u201d Fletcher said. A post shared by Moni Basu (@evilreporterchick) Earlier in the day, the skies grew dark and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods. Amid the rain, Ferguson opened its polls at 6 in the morning with concern that few would come out to vote in such a pivotal election. But Tuesday was different. It was the first city election since white police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August. There was dread, especially in the African-American community, that if the turnout was low, then all the protests, investigations and calls for change would have been in vain. The candidates who had run campaigns calling for change hoped a decent turnout would weigh in their favor. \u201cThat is what our democracy about,\u201d Bell said. Bell ran against Lee Smith, a retired electrical plant employee, in Ward 3, which includes Canfield Drive, where Brown was killed, and the West Florissant Avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism. Charred, heavily damaged buildings still stand as scars of Ferguson\u2019s despair and anger. \u201cYou got your vote on?\u201d yelled Tommy Chatman Bey, a Bell supporter who was distributing campaign literature at Koch Elementary School, the precinct closest to where Brown lived. Some residents did have their vote on. They felt a duty to vote this year. One of them was Yvette Bailey, 41, who works as a planner for Coca-Cola. Yes, she voted in presidential elections, but she never paid much mind to local races. Until now. Even though she was aware of the problems around her, Brown\u2019s killing, she said, woke her up. \u201cIt made me think of all the males in my family,\u201d said Bailey, who lives right off Canfield Drive. She was undecided about who to vote for until the last minute when she walked into the polling station with another voter and they discussed the race. Bailey decided to cast her vote for Bell simply because he was a young man. She thought he had energy and was more in sync with Ferguson\u2019s youth. \u201cI think he will be more open-minded,\u201d she said after voting. Read: Ferguson residents speak out ahead of key vote Changing the way Ferguson polices its people was No. 1 on many a voter\u2019s agenda. Even the candidates who take issue with the Department of Justice report on Ferguson agreed that the city needed change when it came to policing. \u201cWe have to get out of this law enforcement for business,\u201d said candidate Doyle McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College. McClellan referred to the DOJ\u2019s finding that Ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good thing,\u201d McClellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station, hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided. Ted Heidemann, a 67-year-old retired airline pilot, said he voted for Fletcher. If some residents saw Fletcher as part of the problem, Heidemann asked why no one complained when Fletcher was mayor. He said Brown\u2019s shooting brought a lot of bad things to light. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things need to be changed, and we are aware of that.\u201d A post shared by Moni Basu (@evilreporterchick) By midafternoon, Fletcher said the numbers were looking good. At a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots, Fletcher predicted a 40%-50% turnout. When the rain let up for a few minutes, a stream of voters trickled into the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Ferguson to cast their votes. Ellory and Kathy Glenn both voted for Fletcher\u2019s opponent, Hudgins, a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. Hudgins likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son. \u201cI wanted change,\u201d said Ellory Glenn, 60, who is black. His wife is white. He said the couple moved to Ferguson after he retired from the Marine Corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place. But now, after all the problems rose to the surface, it\u2019s time for fresh blood on the council, Glenn said. \u201cQuit using law enforcement as a revenue stream,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThat\u2019s like using the military to go into places and looting them. The police are supposed to keep order.\u201d Angela Jackson came to vote with her husband and two little girls in tow. She voted for Jones, the former Mary Kay cosmetics sales director. Jackson echoed the thoughts of other Ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election: candidates coming to their door. Past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks. Nor have past municipal elections drawn so much media attention. \u201cOne thing we really liked is (Jones) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be hands on. She lives in the neighborhood as well and has for the past 36 years. We were kind of taken by that.\u201d A post shared by Moni Basu (@evilreporterchick) The rain began to fall again as the Glenns got in their car. It was expected to continue off and on through the day and night. But at about 5, just when many voters were leaving work, the sun shone brilliantly. Overheard at one precinct: Good weather brought out the worst in Ferguson last August. Maybe today, it would bring out the best.",
