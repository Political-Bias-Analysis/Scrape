            "article_content": "Iowa\u2019s Attorney General has paused funding for emergency contraception and abortions for sexual assault victims, according to an email Iowa\u2019s Coalition Against Sexual Assault received that was also shared with CNN. The email was sent from Chief Deputy Attorney General Sam Langholz. Attorney General Brenna Bird\u2019s office did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Langholz told the nonprofit that a review of victim\u2019s services is ongoing and the Attorney General has not made a final decision on whether the payments will resume. \u201cWhile not required by Iowa law, the victim compensation fund has previously paid for Plan B and abortions. As a part of her top-down, bottom-up audit of victim assistance, Attorney General Bird is carefully evaluating whether this is an appropriate use of public funds,\u201d Bird\u2019s Press Secretary Alyssa Brouillet said in a statement to the Des Moines Register. \u201cUntil that review is complete, payment of these pending claims will be delayed.\u201d Justice Department and abortion pill manufacturer ask appeals court to freeze judge's order that could make drug unavailable after Friday Langholz shared the same statement from Bird\u2019s press secretary in the email obtained by CNN. Under the 1979 Iowa Sexual Abuse Examination Payment Program, victims of sexual assault in Iowa are \u201cnever responsible for a sexual abuse forensic examination or for medications required due to the assault,\u201d according to Iowa\u2019s Victim Assistance annual report. Though it was not explicitly required, it has been the state\u2019s longtime policy to cover the cost of emergency contraception under the victim compensation fund, and in rare cases, the fund has also paid for abortions for rape victims, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the victim assistance division under the previous attorney general, told the Des Moines Register. After Bird took office, Tibbetts Murphy resigned at request of the new attorney general, the Des Moines Register reported. Funds for the program are entirely made up of fines and penalties paid by convicted criminals, rather than general taxpayer money \u2013 a point victim advocacy groups emphasize. \u201cVictims of rape and child abuse have an acute need for timely access to health services, including contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy and abortion care. Cost should never be a barrier for rape victims seeking medical care,\u201d Iowa\u2019s Coalition Against Sexual Assault said in a statement Monday, urging the attorney general to continue the payments to sexual assault victims. \u201cUsing offender accountability victim compensation funds to cover the cost of forensic exams, incentivizes victims to undergo an invasive exam that can help prevent offenders from victimizing others and enhance access to medical care for crime victims.\u201d Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called Bird\u2019s decision \u201cdeplorable and reprehensible,\u201d saying it \u201cfurther demonstrates politicians\u2019 crusade against Iowans\u2019 health and rights,\u201d according to a statement. Bird, a Republican, won her election in 2022 in a race that largely focused on abortion after her Democratic opponent declined to defend Iowa\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, which would ban most abortions after about six weeks. Access to reproductive health care has become more challenging for women in the US, study shows During her campaign, Bird said, \u201cI am pro-life and I will defend the laws that are passed by the Legislature.\u201d Iowa\u2019s Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that ensuring victims are not responsible for the cost of a forensic exam or for needed medications after an assault is \u201ckey to encouraging victims to undergo this extremely invasive medical exam as soon as possible after a violent assault.\u201d Juveniles accounted for the majority of sexual abuse victim costs paid for by Iowa\u2019s state victim compensation funds, according to a 2021 Iowa\u2019s Victim Assistance report. Nearly 2.9 million women across the US experienced rape-related pregnancy during their lifetime, according to a study published in 2018 by the American Journal of Preventative Medicine. \u201cEmergency contraception should be provided to victims of sexual assault, requiring its immediate availability in hospitals and other facilities where sexual assault victims are treated,\u201d the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says on its website.",

The laser-powered technology has revolutionized major industries since its debut 50 years ago. But, like many great inventions, it remains unclear whose idea it actually was. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can get \u201cCNN\u2019s 5 Things\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) In a historic court appearance Tuesday, former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in a Manhattan criminal court. Prosecutors alleged that Trump sought to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election through a hush money scheme with payments made to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump. He has denied the affairs. After the arraignment, Trump flew back to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where he delivered a speech riddled with false claims. \u201cI never thought anything like this could happen in America, never thought it could happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,\u201d he said. The next in-person hearing is scheduled for December 4, though Trump\u2019s attorneys have vowed to do all they can to stop the case beforehand. Liberals will win control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, CNN projects, flipping majority control in Democrats\u2019 favor in what has been regarded as possibly the most consequential election of 2023. Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, will defeat conservative Daniel Kelly as abortion access, election rules and more remain on the line in the key swing state. The battle also became the nation\u2019s most expensive judicial race on record, with about $30 million spent on advertisements alone. Conservatives currently hold a 4-3 majority on the court, but the retirement of conservative Justice Patience Roggensack put that majority at stake. Florida\u2019s state Senate this week passed a six-week abortion ban, igniting protests at the state capitol that resulted in several arrests. The bill, which still needs to pass the state\u2019s Republican-led House, comes one year after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week ban into law. The new legislation is drawing some attention to the conservative credentials of DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, but has been met with outrage by state Democrats, two of whom were arrested during the protests. The legislation underscores the ongoing efforts across the country to restrict access to abortion following the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Other Republican-led states have also pursued six-week abortion bans that have been met with legal challenges. Volkswagen is recalling 143,000 of its Atlas SUVs due to a \u201csporadic\u201d issue detected in some passenger-side airbags that can switch the sensor off under certain conditions. Until the issue can be corrected, VW is advising owners to avoid letting people ride in the passenger seat. While it\u2019s still unclear what\u2019s causing the problem, VW investigators were able to determine that it was happening in Atlases built during two specific time periods. The vehicles being recalled are all model year 2018 through 2021 Atlas and model year 2020 Atlas Cross Sport SUVs. The company said it is unaware of any injuries that might have resulted from the problem, but is notifying vehicle owners via mail as a safety precaution. Buckingham Palace released King Charles\u2019 coronation invitation on Tuesday, in which his wife was titled Queen Camilla for the first time.

Since she and Charles married, Camilla has worked hard as a senior royal, standing by Charles\u2019 side and championing charities helping women and children. But many people find it hard to forget, or forgive, their long-running affair and the pain it caused Charles\u2019 first wife, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s a look at the life of US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Birth date: April 1, 1950 Birth place: Trenton, New Jersey Birth name: Samuel Anthony Alito Jr. Father: Samuel Alito, a teacher Mother: Rose (Fradusco) Alito, a teacher Marriage: Martha-Ann (Bomgardner) Alito (1985-present) Children: Philip and Laura Education: Princeton University, A.B., 1972; Yale University, J.D., 1975 Nicknamed \u201cScalito\u201d as his views resemble those of the late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, the first in 1982. 1976-1977 - Law clerk to Leonard I. Garth, judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 1977-1981 - Assistant US attorney for the District of New Jersey. 1981-1985 - Assistant to the US solicitor general. 1985-1987 - Deputy assistant to the US attorney general. 1987-1990 - Named by President Ronald Reagan as the US attorney for the District of New Jersey. February 20, 1990 - Nominated by President George H.W. Bush to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. April 27, 1990 - Confirmed unanimously by the Senate on a voice vote. April 30, 1990-2006 - Judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Newark, New Jersey. 1991 - Is the only dissenting voice in a Third Circuit ruling striking down a Pennsylvania law that required women to notify their husbands if they planned to get an abortion. 1993 - Agrees with the majority that an Iranian woman seeking asylum could establish eligibility by showing that she has an abhorrence with her country\u2019s \u201cgender specific laws and repressive social norms,\u201d or because of a belief in feminism or membership in a feminist group. 1999 - Writes the opinion in a case that says a Christmas display on city property does not violate separation of church and state doctrines because it included a large plastic Santa Claus as well as a Menorah and a banner hailing diversity. 2001 - Agrees with the majority that strikes down a public school district\u2019s anti-harassment policy, saying the policy - which included non-vulgar, non-school-sponsored speech - violated the First Amendment. October 31, 2005 - President George W. Bush nominates Alito to be Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s replacement on the Supreme Court. January 31, 2006 - Alito is confirmed as an associate justice to the Supreme Court. The US Senate votes 58-42. He is immediately sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts. February 1, 2006 - Sworn in as a Supreme Court justice a second time in a ceremony at the White House. May 29, 2007 - In a 5-4 ruling, the court dismisses a pay discrimination lawsuit, with Alito writing for the majority. The original suit was filed by a female worker, Lilly Ledbetter against her employer, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. She claimed that she was underpaid due to gender discrimination. In the opinion, Alito writes that Ledbetter filed the claim after the federally-mandated 180-day time window, concluding that the \u201cfiling deadline protects employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions long past.\u201d January 28, 2010 - During a State of the Union address by President Barack Obama, Alito is seen mouthing the words \u201cnot true\u201d in response to the president\u2019s criticism of the court\u2019s 5-4 ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which removed long-established legal limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions. March 2, 2011 - Alito is the sole dissenter in the free speech case involving Westboro Baptist Church. In an 8-1 decision, the court rules that the First Amendment allows the church to carry out anti-gay protests, even at military funerals. Westboro had been sued by the family of a fallen Marine whose funeral was disrupted by church protesters. In his dissent, Alito writes, \u201cOur profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case.\u201d June 25, 2013 - Writes the majority opinion in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl where the question is, can an unwed non-custodial parent block an adoption using the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act. The court ruled, 5-4, in favor of the adoptive parents ruling that the ICWA did not apply when the parent had never had physical or legal custody of the child. June 30, 2014 - Writes the majority opinion in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, with the court ruling 5-4 that family-owned corporations can be exempt from a federal mandate requiring the inclusion of contraception coverage in employee health plans based on religious objections. June 27, 2018 - The court issues a 5-4 ruling striking down an Illinois law requiring non-union public sector workers to pay fees for collective bargaining. The opinion, written by Alito, reads, \u201cIt is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public sector unions in violation of the First Amendment. Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.\u201d February 1, 2019 - Alito temporarily blocks a Louisiana abortion law from going into effect, filing an order that says the justices need more time to review the filings in the case against a measure restricting access to clinics. November 25, 2019 - Writes the sole dissent in the court\u2019s denial of National Review\u2019s defamation suit petition. Climate scientist Michael Mann sued the conservative magazine in 2012 after two columnists wrote about his work and the \u201cHockey Stick\u201d curve graph illustrating the rise in average global temperatures, accusing him of \u201cmisconduct\u201d and data \u201cmanipulation.\u201d Alito writes that the case brings up First Amendment concerns \u201cthat go to the very heart of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the press: the protection afforded to journalists and others who use harsh language in criticizing opposing advocacy on one of the most important public issues of the day. If the Court is serious about protecting freedom of expression, we should grant review.\u201d June 24, 2022 - The Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\u202fIn his majority opinion, Alito says \u201cRoe was egregiously wrong from the start.\u201d November 28, 2022 - In a letter, the Supreme Court legal counsel says there is no evidence that Alito violated ethics standards, in response to questions from congressional Democrats about allegations that Alito revealed the outcome of a 2014 decision before it was released.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will deliver his second State of the Union address next week to a country that has a pretty gloomy outlook on things. For the past two decades, Gallup has surveyed the American public on a collection of policy issues and broad perceptions of society in its annual \u201cMood of the Nation\u201d poll. Average ratings hit record lows during the Covid-19 pandemic and have changed little in this year\u2019s report, responses for which were collected in January. Biden and his team ramp up travel to highlight effects of infrastructure law ahead of State of the Union In 2023, on average, only about a third (36%) of Americans said they were satisfied with a set of policy issues spanning all aspects of government. Among the lowest-rated issues was the state of the economy, which just a quarter of Americans said they were satisfied with. It had the largest year-over-year decline, dropping 8 percentage points. Satisfaction with gun laws dropped sharply this year, to a record low of 34%. Policies on abortion, efforts to control crime, quality of public education and efforts to combat poverty and homelessness also remained at or near low points. \u201cThis notion of a sour mood that the country finds itself in \u2013 a pretty persistent one since Covid that the country hasn\u2019t really bounced out of \u2013 is a challenge for our political leadership,\u201d said David Chalian, CNN\u2019s political director. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a president alone can really upend this.\u201d Long-term trend data from Gallup suggests that there\u2019s a deeper undercurrent affecting the public\u2019s view of the country. Monterey Park hero and Tyre Nichols' family invited to attend State of the Union address Perceptions on specific issues can ebb and flow, said Lydia Saad, director of US social research at Gallup. \u201cThese things bounce around a little bit more. It\u2019s about how much we trust each party and who\u2019s in power to handle these issues,\u201d she said. But satisfaction with broader aspects of American life have been generally trending down for decades, through multiple administration changes and political party shifts. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rise of polarization and decline in national harmony,\u201d Saad said. \u201cOur baseline was a simpler time when people were more content with the country, before a lot of events happened that we know have eroded trust over time.\u201d Perceptions of the overall quality of life in the US dropped to a record low in 2023, as did perceptions of wealth inequality. Less than a quarter of adults say they are satisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the US, according to the Gallup poll. There is some room for optimism, experts say. Democrats coalesce around a Joe Biden 2024 campaign as reelection decision looms Despite the decline, nearly two-thirds of the country (65%) still say they are satisfied with the overall quality of life, and more than half (61%) say there is opportunity for a person to get ahead by working hard. \u201cThose are things to build on,\u201d Saad said. \u201cDespite all, people are still kind of gripping onto the American dream.\u201d Pessimistic attitudes can be a challenge for incumbent political parties, Chalian said. \u201cWhen he addresses the country at his State of the Union next week, how does the President tout progress while also still giving voice to this very, very real sensation among Americans that things are not going quite as well as perhaps they felt they have in the past?\u201d But they\u2019re not always deterministic. \u201cWe just came through an election where the economy was issue number one and tended to favor Republicans,\u201d Chalian said.  \u201cBut there were other issues, like the sanctity and security of our democracy and abortion, that Democrats really rallied around and overperformed expectations in the midterm election, despite the very negative views on the economy.\u201d",

September 4-7, 2018 - Confirmation hearings are held on Capitol Hill.  A Senate Judiciary Committee vote is tentatively slated for the week of September 17. September 16, 2018 - The Washington Post publishes an article about a California psychology professor who accuses Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her when they were both teenagers at a house party during the early 1980s. Christine Blasey Ford says she initially sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein about the incident when Kavanaugh\u2019s name was included on a shortlist for the Supreme Court. Ford tells the newspaper she initially did not want to go public but she decided to talk on the record because her letter to Feinstein had been leaked to the media. Kavanaugh denies that such an incident ever took place. September 23, 2018 - The New Yorker magazine publishes a report about a second allegation of sexual misconduct, prompting Feinstein to call for a postponement of confirmation proceedings. The magazine article centers on a college classmate from Yale, Deborah Ramirez who says Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while a group of students were drinking at a party in a dorm during the 1983-1984 academic year. Kavanaugh denies the allegation and a White House spokeswoman dismisses the claim as uncorroborated.

September 28, 2018 - GOP Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Judiciary Committee, agrees to vote yes, paving the way to a floor vote but he says the FBI should reopen its background investigation of Kavanaugh and spend a week looking into claims made by Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers.

October 3, 2018 - The FBI completes its supplemental background check and sends the information to the Senate late in the day. October 4, 2018 - The Wall Street Journal publishes an op-ed by Kavanaugh in which argues that he is an independent, impartial judge. He expresses regret for a few of his statements during the September 27 hearing, explaining that he was frustrated and emotional. He pledges, going forward, that litigants and colleagues will be treated with respect. The same day, retired Justice John Paul Stevens says that Kavanaugh\u2019s comments during his confirmation hearings suggest bias. Stevens says Kavanaugh should not serve on the Supreme Court. October 6, 2018 - The Senate confirms Kavanaugh with a 50-48 vote. He is sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts during a private ceremony. The vote takes place amid public protests for and against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. September 14, 2019 - The New York Times publishes an article adapted from a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh\u201d that contains a new allegation of college sexual misconduct. According to the report, the FBI did not investigate the new allegation and the bureau did not speak with witnesses to verify Ramirez\u2019s original claim. July 2020 - An exclusive CNN report says Kavanaugh urged his colleagues in a series of private memos this spring to consider avoiding decisions in major disputes over abortion and Democratic subpoenas for Trump\u2019s financial records, according to multiple sources familiar with the inner workings of the court.

October 1, 2021 - The Supreme Court announces that Kavanaugh has tested positive for Covid-19. This is the first publicly known case of coronavirus among the high court\u2019s justices. Kavanaugh was fully vaccinated, according to the court. June 8, 2022 - Nicholas John Roske is arrested near Kavanaugh\u2019s house, after calling emergency authorities to say he was having suicidal thoughts, had a firearm in his suitcase, and had traveled from California \u201cto kill a specific US Supreme Court Justice.\u201d The Justice Department charges him with attempting to kidnap or murder a US judge.

The new House GOP majority is locked in a chaotic stalemate over who will serve as the next speaker after Republican Kevin McCarthy failed to secure the necessary support to win after three rounds of voting on Tuesday. The House is set to reconvene at noon today with hopes to reach a resolution. McCarthy\u2019s allies say he\u2019s not dropping out, despite opposition from a small but determined contingent of hardline conservatives who are intent on denying him the votes needed to secure the gavel. McCarthy\u2019s failure to lock down the votes so far has heightened uncertainty over whether he can win, or if a viable candidate could emerge as an alternative. The last time an election for speaker went to multiple ballots was in 1923. Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin remains in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest on the field during Monday night\u2019s game. \u201cHis heart had went out so they had to resuscitate him twice,\u201d his uncle Dorrian Glenn told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThey resuscitated him on the field before they brought him to the hospital and then they resuscitated him a second time when they got him to the hospital,\u201d he explained. Medical experts say the next step is to get Hamlin, who is still sedated and on a ventilator, to breathe on his own. As for the Buffalo Bills team, players and coaches are emotionally distraught as they anxiously await an update on Hamlin\u2019s condition, sources say. Meanwhile, the NFL has not made any changes to this upcoming weekend\u2019s schedule, with the Bills set to host the New England Patriots on Sunday. A new Covid-19 variant known as XBB.1.5 has become the dominant variant in the US, causing most new coronavirus cases, data from the CDC shows. For weeks, scientists have been monitoring a rise in several Omicron subvariants, but XBB.1.5 cases have shown the greatest spike, rising from about 4% to 41% of new infections over the month of December. Scientists say the variant has features that give it the potential to drive a new surge of Covid-19 cases in the US, although it\u2019s still unclear how large that wave will be and whether it could send more people to the hospital. Many experts in the medical community are also saying that XBB.1.5 has shifted far away from earlier Covid-19 strains, and therefore has the potential to escape the protections of vaccinations and antibodies developed from past infections. The FDA announced it will allow pharmacies to dispense the abortion medication mifepristone to patients. Mifepristone can be used along with another medication, misoprostol, to end a pregnancy. As of Tuesday, the FDA said it would no longer enforce a rule requiring people to get the first of the two drugs in person at a clinic or hospital. Certified pharmacies can instead dispense the drugs directly to someone who has a prescription. The FDA\u2019s move comes days after a new Justice Department legal opinion declared that federal law allows the US Postal Service to deliver the abortion drugs \u2013 a move the Biden administration believes could help protect access to abortion in states that have enacted bans following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Japan is offering to pay families to move out of its overcrowded capital. Starting in April, the incentive \u2013 equivalent to about $7,700 per child \u2013 will be issued to families if they move from Tokyo to less-populated\u00a0countryside towns, a spokesperson from the central government said. Tokyo is the country\u2019s most populous city, with roughly 37 million residents. For decades, people across Japan have migrated to its urban centers seeking job opportunities. With little space, prices have skyrocketed, while rural towns have been left with fewer residents \u2013 as well as millions of unoccupied homes. This is not the first time the government has tried to use financial incentives to encourage people to leave, but the new plan is more generous at three times the amount currently offered.

            "article_content": "Floridians woke up Friday morning to discover Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed into law a six-week abortion ban overnight, meeting behind closed doors with a select group of invited guests to give final approval to a bill that had just passed the state legislature earlier in the day. In backing a six-week ban, DeSantis fulfilled a campaign pledge to block abortion after the detection of a heartbeat \u2013 just before he is expected to launch his 2024 presidential bid. But as he inches toward a national campaign, DeSantis, who rarely sidesteps cultural clashes, has also become oddly muted on abortion since the fall of Roe v. Wade and has avoided laying out a federal platform before jumping into the race. Speaking Friday morning to an overwhelmingly pro-life audience at Liberty University, a deeply conservative Baptist college in Virginia, DeSantis didn\u2019t mention the bill he had signed the night before. The late-night private signing also stood in stark contrast to the celebratory event exactly a year prior, when DeSantis, surrounded by women and children and in front of hundreds of onlookers, enacted a 15-week abortion ban at a Orlando-area megachurch as news cameras captured the scene. The six-week ban \u201cis going to cause a lot of problems for him,\u201d said Amy Tarkanian, the former chairwoman of the Republican Party in Nevada, where voters have cemented abortion protections in the state constitution. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pro-life, but I can see the writing on the wall.\u201d The US Supreme Court decision last June that ended a federal right to abortion access has throttled the national political landscape, energizing Democrats and leaving Republicans grasping for a message that can blunt the fallout. The latest harbinger of trouble for the GOP came last week from Wisconsin, a presidential swing state where liberals took control of the state Supreme Court in an election fought over the future of abortion access. But with DeSantis on the verge of entering the GOP presidential primary \u2013 for which abortion is often a litmus test for candidates \u2013 Republican state lawmakers delivered their leader a political victory, flexing their super majorities in both Florida chambers to swiftly push through the new restrictions. The law will take effect if the state Supreme Court overturns its past precedent protecting abortion access, which is widely expected. When that happens, Florida, once a sanctuary for Southern women whose states had made it difficult to legally end a pregnancy, will become one of the hardest states in the country to obtain an abortion. In an early sign of how Democrats intend to paint DeSantis, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement called Florida\u2019s bill \u201cextreme and dangerous\u201d and said it \u201cis out of step with the views of the vast majority of the people of Florida and of all the United States.\u201d A Republican fundraiser close to the governor\u2019s political operation told CNN that the six-week ban would play \u201cgreat in primary,\u201d where DeSantis would face former President Donald Trump, who appointed three of the justices that voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, but acknowledged it was \u201cnot good in general\u201d election. \u201cBut you got to get to the general,\u201d the adviser added. In the year following the Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Democrats have rattled off a series of victories built in part on voters mobilized by abortion. In solidly red Kansas, voters last year blocked a referendum that would have amended the state constitution to make abortion illegal. In key states like Pennsylvania and Nevada, Democrats pummeled Republican Senate candidate over their views on abortion \u2013 with great success, as the party held the US Senate. In battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan, Democratic gubernatorial candidates won by vowing to lift longstanding state abortion bans that predated the Roe decision. Whether the issue continues to animate general voters remains to be seen, but opinions on the Dobbs decision do not appear to have shifted. A Marquette Law School poll last month found two-thirds of voters opposed the ruling, nearly identical to the results in its survey following the November midterms. Amid the national outcry to the SCOTUS decision, the typically outspoken DeSantis has remained uncharacteristically reserved on the topic. Unlike other issues, like eliminating college diversity programs and curbing legal protections for the media, he has elevated with staged news conferences and frequent messaging on conservative media, DeSantis has offered vague commitments to protect life but repeatedly declined to say where Florida should draw the line on abortion access. In his lone debate last year against Democratic gubernatorial opponent Charlie Crist, DeSantis wouldn\u2019t say what abortion restrictions he would pursue if reelected for a second term. Asked at a March news conference if he supported exceptions for victims rape and incest, DeSantis called it \u201csensible\u201d and said he would \u201cwelcome pro-life legislation,\u201d then quickly pivoted to another topic. DeSantis signed the bill at 10:45 p.m. ET Thursday in a closed-door ceremony after returning from a political event in Ohio, a rare-late night action by a governor who often times his actions to maximize exposure. \u201cI can\u2019t speculate on his mental processes and what he decides to speak on,\u201d said John Stemberger, president of Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative Christian organization that supported the bill. \u201cI\u2019m concerned not with words but with action and he is a man of action.\u201d Some Republican operatives believe DeSantis is better positioned than others to stave off primary attacks from the right without alienating swing voters. In a series of posts on Twitter, Jon Schweppe, director of policy and government affairs at the conservative American Principles Project, suggested that by supporting some exceptions for rape and incest, DeSantis would neutralize a key Democratic talking point. \u201cWhat moves voters the most? What did Democrats spend $500M talking about in the 2022 midterms? EXCEPTIONS,\u201d Schweppe said. \u201cVoters want exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. That\u2019s the most important issue. Outside those exceptions, voters are fairly pro-life.\u201d Schweppe had previously raised the alarm that \u201cRepublicans need to figure out the abortion issue ASAP\u201d after last week\u2019s defeat of a conservative judge in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The exceptions offered by Florida\u2019s proposed six-week ban, though, are limited to 15 weeks after conception and require victims of rape and incest to show a police report or other evidence of their assault to obtain an abortion. Similarly, two doctors would have to sign off that a mother\u2019s health is at serious risk or a fetal abnormality is fatal before a woman can end a pregnancy after 15 weeks. Bill McCoshen, a veteran GOP consultant in Wisconsin, acknowledged that Democrats have campaigned effectively on abortion there in recent races. But he said it will be harder to attack DeSantis on abortion in his state, where the current law, passed in 1849 and reinstated after the fall of Roe, bars abortion without exceptions. \u201cTo voters here, the perception of his answer will be that it\u2019s better than the 1849 law,\u201d McCoshen said. \u201cIf he signs that law, that will be an improvement of the law that\u2019s here. It may not be as middle of the road as some states, but it\u2019s better than what we currently have in many people\u2019s minds.\u201d Still unclear, though, is how DeSantis will navigate new pressures from conservative voters, many of whom will expect their next nominee to use the powers of the presidency to end abortion nationwide. DeSantis, who has not yet declared but is laying the groundwork for a campaign, has so far not faced any questions about what abortion restrictions he would pursue if elected to the White House. It\u2019s a question that has already tripped up one potential rival for the nomination. A day after sidestepping a question earlier this week, Republican Sen. Tim Scott said on Thursday that it should be up to states to \u201csolve that problem on their own\u201d \u2013 but also said he would sign a federal 20-week ban if it reached his desk. Nor has DeSantis weighed in on the ongoing legal saga surrounding mifepristone, one of the drugs that has been used safely for more than 20 years to provide abortions via medication. \u201cRight now, DeSantis represents his state and he has to be the voice of his state, but this is a tightrope he has to walk if he\u2019s serious about running for president,\u201d Tarkanian, the Nevada Republican said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re pregnant at seven weeks and if you\u2019re pro-choice that\u2019s a scary thought.\u201d Katie Daniel, the state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said Republican candidates risk looking inauthentic if they try to obfuscate their position on abortion. She pointed to Pennsylvania Senate candidate and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who during the GOP primary called abortion \u201cmurder\u201d at any stage but in the general election said he supported exceptions for rape, incest or if the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Later, in a debate, Oz said, \u201cI want women, doctors, local political leaders\u201d to decide the issue at the state level. \u201cOur message to candidates is define yourself or other candidates will define it for you and you\u2019re not going to like their version of you,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cThe ostrich strategy of burying your head in the sand is not going to work.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Chicago will host the 2024 Democratic National Convention, the Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday. The convention will be held from August 19-22, 2024. In its announcement, the DNC called the Midwest a \u201ccritical Democratic stronghold\u201d that helped President Joe Biden win the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI am thrilled that Democrats will take the stage in Chicago to share our party\u2019s vision and values,\u201d DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said. \u201cThe Midwest reflects America and will give Democrats an opportunity to showcase some of President Biden and Vice President Harris\u2019s most significant accomplishments for American families.\u201d Chicago beat out the other two finalists, Atlanta and New York. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s pledge to finance the Democratic convention \u2013 through fundraising and his own wealth \u2013 provided a key edge to Chicago, officials said. At the same time, Georgia\u2019s GOP caused worry \u2013 largely because the state has partial control of the arena and would be under no obligation to bend to Democratic concerns on guns, etc, officials said. The Chicago decision was also supported by top Democrats in neighboring Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 two critical pieces of Biden\u2019s blue wall \u2013 and is seen as a stronger place to \u201ccelebrate progressives and fight for abortion rights and other priorities,\u201d an official said. While Chicago gun violence has been a concern \u2013 and the new untested mayor \u2013 the White House concluded Chicago outweighed Atlanta from logistics to political considerations, an official said. \u201cThe 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago will welcome people from across the nation to an unforgettable event highlighting our party\u2019s vision for lifting up working families and those who too often have been left out and left behind,\u201d Pritzker said. Biden, while on his way to Air Force One ahead of his trip to Ireland, called the governor to tell him Chicago would be \u201chis convention city,\u201d Pritzker told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Tuesday night. \u201cI told him how thrilled that we were and how we\u2019re going to put on the best convention that the Democratic Party has ever had and it will be Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019 convention,\u201d he said. The Democratic governor dismissed concerns about the president\u2019s age, telling Collins that \u201cwhat matters is what you can get done for working families across the United States.\u201d Historically, conventional wisdom has held that Chicago was the best place to nominate a presidential candidate. This will be the 26th major political nominating convention held in the Windy City, but the first since Democrats renominated Bill Clinton there in 1996. The Republican National Convention will be held in Milwaukee in July 2024. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz and Jack Forrest contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "After the Michigan Republican Party faced intense backlash for using Holocaust imagery on its social media to oppose what it says are Democrats\u2019 restrictive gun proposals, the new chair of the state GOP party did not apologize \u2013 in fact, she doubled down on the party\u2019s post. \u201cGovernment abuse of citizens has not only happened in world history, but American history,\u201d Kristina Karamo, the first Black chair of the Michigan GOP wrote on Twitter defending the comparison. \u201cWe will not be silent as the Democratic Party, the party who fought to enslave Black Americans, and currently fights to murder unborn children, attempt to disarm us. Our 2nd Amendment was put in place to protect us from aspiring tyrants.\u201d This is not the first time Karamo espoused controversial and sometimes bizarre comments, which are almost too numerous to list in their entirety, according to a CNN KFile review of her comments, mostly made over the last few years. Karamo has claimed in the past that Beyonc\u00e9 was secretly recruiting Black Americans to Paganism through a new album; that \u201cdemonic possession is real\u201d and transferred via \u201cintimate relationships\u201d; and that acceptance of gay and transgender Americans will lead to the acceptance of pedophilia. She has said that the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement are \u201cMarxist witches\u201d; that the theory of evolution is \u201cone of the biggest scams ran on us in human history\u201d; and that doing drugs is \u201cwitchcraft.\u201d She has compared abortion to Pagan child sacrifice. In the past, Karamo has also compared the media to Nazi Germany, saying media rhetoric about Republicans will lead to them being rounded up, killed and put in concentration camps. A proud anti-vaxxer, Karamo has also said she doesn\u2019t believe in vaccines \u2013 saying she won\u2019t vaccinate her children and has only taken one vaccine herself. After losing every statewide office and full control of the state government for the first time in nearly 40 years, Michigan Republicans elected Karamo \u2013 who made these comments and many others within the last few years \u2013 as their new state party chairwoman and the first Black person to lead the state party. Karamo, an election denier who believes the 2020 presidential race was stolen, has also refused to concede her own 2022 race for Michigan Secretary of State, which she lost by 14 percentage points \u2013 the most lopsided loss of any statewide candidate last year. Before she entered politics, Karamo worked as a community college professor and earned a master\u2019s degree in Christian apologetics. Karamo did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Here is what the leader of Michigan\u2019s state Republican party has said on a variety of issues. Karamo, who has served on the board of Michigan\u2019s Right to Life organization and on the board of an anti-abortion pregnancy crisis center affiliate in Detroit, is staunchly opposed to abortion. She has called abortion \u201cchild sacrifice\u201d and a \u201csatanic practice,\u201d as CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported. \u201cAbortion is really nothing new. The child sacrifice is a very satanic practice, and that\u2019s precisely what abortion is. And we need to see it as such,\u201d Karamo said in an October 2020 episode of her podcast \u201cIt\u2019s Solid Food.\u201d \u201cWhen people in other cultures, when they engage in child sacrifice, they didn\u2019t just sacrifice the child for the sake of bloodshed,\u201d Karamo said later in the episode. \u201cThey sacrificed the child cuz they were hoping to get prosperity and that\u2019s precisely why people have abortion now. \u2018Because I\u2019m not ready. I don\u2019t wanna have a baby. I don\u2019t feel like it. I don\u2019t have time. I wanna make more money. I want my freedom.\u2019 So you\u2019re sacrificing that child hoping to get something out of their death, which is your freedom, your happiness, your prosperity.\u201d In another episode from July 2020, Karamo said that humans have sacrificed other humans, including their own children, for \u201cthousands of years, just packaged differently.\u201d \u201c[People] were sacrificing them to these deities, which were really demons,\u201d she said. In other media reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Karamo called abortion the \u201cgreatest crime in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Karamo has repeatedly attacked the LGBTQ community, accusing them of indoctrinating people with \u201csexual perversion\u201d and equating acceptance of transgender people with the normalization of pedophilia. In a November 2020 episode of her podcast, she said that the LGBTQ movement would \u201cindoctrinate [people] with sexual perversion,\u201d and that \u201cpedophilia is going to be normalized.\u201d Karamo has baselessly connected transgender acceptance to pedophilia on several occasions. \u201cThis is why people say the whole transgenderism movement is going to lead to the normalization of pedophilia.\u201d she said in an October 2020 podcast episode. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re going to say the children have the sexual autonomy to change their gender, then how can you logically say they lack the sexual autonomy to have sex with an adult. You can\u2019t, those things go against one another, it\u2019s incoherent. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she added. In the same episode, Karamo dismissed transgender identity as \u201ca mental problem\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d A devout Christian, Karamo has framed most things outside of her worldview as a direct result of \u201cSatanism,\u201d condemning everything from yoga (which she called a \u201csatanic ritual\u201d) to popular musicians to Democrats as \u201cevil.\u201d As the liberal watchdog Media Matters first reported, Karamo has baselessly accused music stars like Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Cardi B, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish of being tools of Satan. She claimed Beyonc\u00e9 used an album to convert Black Americans to paganism; that Cardi B was a \u201ctool of Lucifer because she peddles filth in the culture\u201d; and that Grande and Eilish put children under a \u201csatanic delusion.\u201d She has also said that the \u201csexual revolution\u201d was a \u201cwell thought-out orchestrated plan by Satan.\u201d \u201cAnd you can see his fingerprints all over it, all over it, regarding how well organized it is and how effective it has been in encouraging and pushing people to rebel against God, causing all types of societal harm and ultimately causing so many souls to be lost into hell,\u201d said Karamo in a September 2020 podcast. Karamo has also denounced the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it \u201cnothing but Marxism and Satanism in blackface.\u201d In a September 2020 podcast, she claimed Black Lives Matter\u2019s leaders were \u201cMarxist witches\u201d and said,\u201dit\u2019s rooted in Pagan religion, and you\u2019re channeling spirits and you\u2019re performing satanic rituals to get your movement done.\u201d Karamo also believes that demonic possession is real, claiming it can be transmitted through \u201cintimate relationships.\u201d \u201cIf a person has demonic possession \u2014 I know it\u2019s gonna sound really crazy to me saying that for some people, thinking like what?!\u201d Karamo said in September 2020. \u201cBut having intimate relationships with people who are demonically possessed or oppressed \u2014 I strongly believe that a person opens themselves up to possession. Demonic possession is real.\u201d An election denier who was backed by former President Donald Trump during her secretary of state race in 2022, Karamo has made unsupported allegations about threats to conservatives. In a podcast shortly after the 2020 election, Karamo criticized the mainstream media and claimed it had promoted imprisoning and killing Trump\u2019s supporters, comparing the media to Nazi Germany. \u201cMajor news outlets are peddling that me and you need to die, we need to be dead or put in camps. Because again, how else do you remove people from society? By either killing them or putting them in camps? That\u2019s it, there\u2019s no other way to remove people from society. So they\u2019re either calling for us to die or be put in camps, all because we back President Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I just mentioned earlier about Hitler. He got to that point. He didn\u2019t just wake up one day and say \u2018Okay, everybody, we\u2019re gonna round up all the Jews, put \u2018em in concentration camps, kill \u2018em.\u2019\u201d Karamo continued. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just step by step by step by step it got to that point. And it started with what the people on MSNBC are doing.\u201d She predicted that if court disputes over the election did not end favorably for Trump, \u201clists\u201d would be made to remove, imprison or kill Republicans. \u201cIf things do not go the way I hope they do through the courts for President Trump, it\u2019s gonna be hell,\u201d Karamo said. \u201cThey\u2019re calling for lists to be made. Tell me one Republican that\u2019s calling for everyday Democrats and liberals and leftists to be put in camps or killed, removed from society, denied jobs, lists made,\u201d she added. Karamo has also characterized herself as an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d and peddled false claims about vaccination. In a July 2020 podcast episode, she said she didn\u2019t believe in vaccination and would not vaccinate her children. In a December 2020 episode, she said she had only been vaccinated once, during her childhood. \u201cI\u2019m an unvaccinated person. I have \u2013 my mom gave me one vaccine when I was a little,\u201d Karamo said. Karamo made nonsensical claims distinguishing inoculation from vaccination. According to the definitions laid out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is virtually no difference between the terms, which refer to steps of the same process and may be used interchangeably. As defined by the CDC, vaccination refers to the act of introducing a vaccine to produce protection from a disease; immunization, which is synonymous with inoculation, is the process by which a person becomes protected against a disease through vaccination. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the concept of inoculation, which I completely support,\u201d she said in the December 2020 episode. Karamo also suggested companies producing vaccines could not be trusted, adding that \u201cthe issue is that these vaccines have a bunch of additives and ingredients in there and they do a bunch of combo shots and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these shots they\u2019re giving us. It\u2019s just like, \u2018Take it, shut up. Don\u2019t ask questions.\u2019\u201d In addition, Karamo relayed a story about a woman who claimed a vaccine caused her son\u2019s autism and said that autism was skyrocketing due to vaccine use. The idea that vaccines can cause autism has repeatedly been debunked by scientific studies.",

            "article_content": "A single conservative judge in Texas has provoked sudden health care and legal chaos by effectively halting the nationwide use of a popular abortion drug by the end of the week. US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk\u2019s decision to suspend the Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug mifepristone, which has been used safely for more than 20 years, marked an extraordinary use of judicial power in the face of scientific data and is likely to force the Supreme Court to take up abortion again, a year after it overturned Roe v. Wade. His ruling on Friday, which he paused for a week to allow appeals, also represented a judicial intervention into the health care decisions of millions of American women and could effectively make abortion unavailable in many states if it goes into force. The Biden administration is already mobilizing to thwart the judge\u2019s audacious move after lodging an appeal. Democrats slam Texas abortion ruling as Republicans mostly go quiet But the ruling is causing sharp political reverberations amid criticism from health care regulators and providers. The situation is complicated because less than an hour later, a judge in Washington state issued a dueling ruling requiring the government to keep the drug available in 18 liberal jurisdictions that had sued to expand access to abortion pills. Politically, this latest resurgence of abortion politics will raise fears among Republicans that the party\u2019s rigid anti-abortion line could provoke a backlash \u2013 and it\u2019s already giving Democrats a powerful new example to mobilize voters heading into 2024. The intensity of the storm Kacsmaryk whipped up was evident in heated rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats on Sunday. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra vowed that women would have safe and effective medication available after the administration launched a legal appeal to stop the suspension from going into force on Friday. \u201cFor America\u2019s sake and for women\u2019s sake, we have to prevail in this,\u201d Becerra told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the ruling an \u201cextreme abuse of power\u201d on the same show. And in a sign of a growing constitutional tangle, she suggested the FDA could effectively ignore it on the grounds that it was a \u201cmockery of our democracy, and a mockery of our law.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez won unusual support from across the aisle when GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Monday that she agreed with her colleague from New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us to decide as legislators, or even as a court system, whether or not this is the right drug to use or not,\u201d Mace told Kaitlan Collins. \u201cThis is an FDA-approved drug. Whether you agree with its usage or not, that is not your decision. That is the FDA\u2019s decision.\u201d Mace also recognized her own party\u2019s problems on the abortion issue. \u201cThis is one of those issues that I\u2019ve tried to lead on as someone who\u2019s pro-life and just have some common sense. We are getting it wrong on this issue. We\u2019ve got to show compassion to women, especially to women who\u2019ve been raped. We\u2019ve got to show compassion on the abortion issue, because by and large, most of Americans aren\u2019t with us on this issue.\u201d But Texas Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales told CNN\u2019s Bash that his party could use its House majority to punish the FDA if the agency took such a step. \u201cIf the administration wants to \u2026 not live up to this ruling, then we\u2019re going to have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may come (to) a point where House Republicans on the appropriation side have to defund FDA programs that don\u2019t make sense.\u201d HHS secretary says 'everything is on the table' in response to medication abortion ruling Such a move could severely impede a critical arm of the American health care system and deepen acrimony surrounding the regulatory approval process, which was attacked by conservatives amid skepticism of the Covid-19 vaccine. Gonzales also blithely dismissed concerns of women who will fear they can no longer get mifepristone and anger over the removal of a constitutional right to make decisions about one\u2019s own reproductive health. His comment was exactly the kind of controversial statement that has contributed to Republicans\u2019 struggles with female voters. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have real discussions on women\u2019s health care and \u2026 get off the abortion conversation,\u201d Gonzales told Bash. \u201cWomen have a whole lot more other issues than just abortion. Let\u2019s have those real conversations, and let\u2019s talk about the other things that are happening in this world.\u201d The new front in the abortion battle will only intensify national political tumult, which is also being fueled by showdowns over guns, a building debt-ceiling clash and Donald Trump\u2019s recent indictment. But the ruling by Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by the ex-president, stirred up some potentially intractable controversies. \u2014 It set up a legal collision that seems destined to end up at the Supreme Court. There is the question over whether the judge overstepped his power to halt the FDA\u2019s approval for mifepristone \u2013 a key resource given that half of US abortions are performed using medication. And the Washington judge\u2019s ruling sets up the kind of dueling interpretations of law only the Supreme Court can resolve. \u2014 The idea that a single judge in a conservative state could potentially change the health care options of millions of Americans sets up an extraordinary constitutional situation. It also flies in the face of the reasoning advanced by the conservative majority Supreme Court and anti-abortion rights advocates \u2013 that the procedure\u2019s availability should be determined by legislatures in individual states. \u2014 Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling also threatens to create problems for the approval of future drugs or to open the way to legal challenges for existing drugs. And it is another sign of a prominent conservative figure substituting his own lack of scientific expertise for that of doctors and the rigor of clinical trials. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. The risk of death from the use of penicillin is four times greater. Kacsmaryk, however, argued that the FDA had \u201centirely failed to consider the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of its long term-term medical consequences.\u201d American Medical Association President Jack Resneck, Jr. criticized the judge\u2019s \u201cdisregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation.\u201d He added: \u201cBy rejecting medical facts, the court has intruded into the exam room and has intervened in decisions that belong to patients and physicians.\u201d \u2014 The resurgence of the abortion debate may be unwelcome news for Republicans. The overturning of Roe v. Wade last year turned out to be a motivating factor for Democratic voters in the midterm elections. According to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted last July, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, nearly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the decision. And just last week, abortion was also a key issue in a Wisconsin election that handed control of the state Supreme Court to liberals. The decision by Kacsmaryk, a long-time opponent of abortion rights, is the latest occasion where a high-profile member of the conservative movement has launched a daring application of power in a way that Democrats argue trashes legal and democratic convention. Previous examples include the Republican majority\u2019s expulsion of two Black state legislators from the Tennessee state House last week after they joined a gun control protest in the chamber; attempts by some conservative states to curtail voting access; and even Trump\u2019s bid to overturn the 2020 election.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is now in a stronger position to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination than he has been in months as his party rallies around him following his indictment by a New York grand jury on business fraud charges. But actual results on the ground continue to suggest that the former president may not be good for the Republican brand among the general electorate. On the day of Trump\u2019s arraignment in Manhattan on Tuesday, Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz celebrated victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election as liberals won control of the high court in the ultimate swing state. That result is just part of a larger story in which Democrats and Democratic-backed candidates across the nation have been performing better in elections this year than Joe Biden did in their states or districts in 2020. And it potentially portends well for Democrats\u2019 2024 fortunes. The result in Wisconsin sums up the Republican problem. Biden won the state by less than a point in 2020, after Trump had carried it by a similar margin four years earlier. The Badger State is one of a handful that has voted for the winner in the last four presidential elections, and it is one of few that has a US senator of each party. Protasiewicz\u2019s 11-point winning margin over her Republican opponent is a relative blowout compared with Biden\u2019s 2020 performance in Wisconsin. Liberal judge's victory in Wisconsin Supreme Court race marks political shift in key swing state We can also see the Democratic overperformance in Wisconsin in another Tuesday election, this one a state Senate election in the Milwaukee area. While not spoken about anywhere near as much as the state Supreme Court race, Republicans needed to hold the open seat to win a supermajority in the state Senate. The Republican candidate did win, but only by 2 points. This marked a 3-point overperformance for the Democratic nominee as Biden lost the district by 5 points in 2020. The Wisconsin results match up well with what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2023 special election across the country. In the lone federal special election so far this year, Democrat Jennifer McCllean outperformed Biden\u2019s 2020 margin in Virginia\u2019s 4th Congressional District by 13 points. In the average of nearly 20 special state legislative elections, Democrats have done about 4 points better than Biden\u2019s margin, on average. The president, of course, won the 2020 election, so the fact that the political environment looks to be better for Democrats now than it was then is a good sign for his party. It also marks a big difference with what we saw in 2019 when Democrats in special elections were nearly on par with Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 margins. That came after Democrats overperformed Clinton in the 2018 midterms. It was a signal that the 2020 elections might be close. What makes the Democrats\u2019 strong showings this year especially odd is that they are occurring with Biden\u2019s approval rating stuck in the low 40s. Normally, you wouldn\u2019t expect an unpopular president\u2019s party to do so well in off-year elections. This suggests that the factors currently at play are similar to those in the latter half of 2022. Following the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade halfway through the year, Democrats started to outdo Biden\u2019s 2020 margins in districts that held special elections. Democrats push abortion rights to the ballot in 2024, using an old GOP playbook And Democrats had a historically exceptional night in the November midterms. They more than held their own, despite Biden\u2019s approval rating being well south of 50%. The midterm exit polls revealed that many voters who didn\u2019t like Biden or Trump voted Democratic. Almost all the key races in the states that will likely decide the presidency in 2024 went Democratic. Put another way, Biden wasn\u2019t the deciding factor you might have expected him to be among swing voters. Trump factored into their vote too, even though he wasn\u2019t president. Neither abortion nor Trump seem to be going away as an issue in 2023. Abortion was at the forefront of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, with liberals hoping that a win by Protasiewicz would provide them with a majority to legalize the procedure statewide. And Trump remains the clear favorite for the GOP nomination for president, despite his indictment and continuing unpopularity among the general electorate. If those things don\u2019t change going into 2024, Republicans may be in big trouble.",

            "article_content": "What initially looked like an outright victory for anti-abortion activists Friday evening soon became more complicated. US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, first ruled Friday that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s 2000 approval of mifepristone \u2013 one of the drugs used to terminate a pregnancy \u2013 needed to be halted. But less than an hour after Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling, US District Judge Thomas Owen Rice of the Eastern District of Washington, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, ordered the federal government to keep the drug available in 17 states plus the District of Columbia. Because the decisions out of the two courts are so contradictory, intervention from the US Supreme Court is a real possibility. In the meantime, here\u2019s what you need to know about Rice. Rice was appointed to the Eastern District of Washington in 2011 by Obama. He was confirmed to the position by the US Senate in a 93-4 vote in 2012. He had served as an assistant US attorney in Washington state starting in 1987. In that role, he focused on issues related to eminent domain and Social Security claims. Prior to that, Rice was a trial attorney in the tax division of the US Department of Justice, where he specialized in abusive tax shelter litigation. Rice previously sided with an abortion rights group. In 2018, he issued a permanent injunction that blocked the Trump administration from stopping grants to a Planned Parenthood program that funded teen pregnancy prevention programs around the country. That case was brought against the Trump administration by Planned Parenthood after the administration ended Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants earlier than they were supposed to end for 81 organizations across the US, claiming they had been unsuccessful. \u201cThe Court determines that the public interest weighs in favor of (Planned Parenthood), as it would prevent harm to the community \u2026 and prevent loss of data regarding the effectiveness of teen pregnancy prevention,\u201d Rice wrote at the time. When residents of Yakima, Washington, sued the city, claiming its \u201cat-large\u201d seats on the City Council prevented Latinos from electing members who represented their Latino-majority community, Rice ruled that the election system violated the Voting Rights Act. \u201cThe existing record, undisputed in all material respects, supports only one rational conclusion: that under the totality of the circumstances, City Council elections are not \u2018equally open to participation\u2019 by Latino voters,\u201d Rice said in his 2014 Montes v. City of Yakima decision. \u201cThe numbered post system, with its effective majority vote requirement, places Latino voters at a steep mathematical disadvantage, even when their voting strength is perfectly optimized.\u201d In recent weeks, Rice has presided over cases related to a federal firearm offense, assault of a federal officer with a deadly weapon, and fraudulently obtained Covid-19 relief funds. Rice\u2019s response to lawmakers during his confirmation hearing offered a glimpse into how he thinks as a judge and how he would view the decisions of higher courts. When asked by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa if he was committed to following the precedents of higher courts \u201cfaithfully and giving them full force and effect, even if you personally disagree with such precedents,\u201d Rice responded \u201cyes.\u201d Rice was also asked which sources and guiding principles he would use in deciding cases of first impression if there were no controlling precedents that \u201cdispositively concluded an issue\u201d before him. \u201cI would first turn to the plain meaning of the words of the statute,\u201d the judge responded. \u201cIf necessary, I would seek to determine the context and intent of Congress. I would also look to analogous cases from the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for guidance. If no other similar cases were available, I would consult other federal court decisions that considered the issue or like issues.\u201d Rice also said he would \u201capply binding Supreme Court and Court of Appeals precedent without regard to my personal judgment\u201d when he was asked what he would do if he thought the Supreme Court or the court of appeals had \u201cseriously erred in rendering a decision,\u201d and if he would either apply that decision or use his \u201cown judgment of the merits, or your best judgment of the merits.\u201d Following Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling in Texas, the Justice Department and a mifepristone manufacturer have filed notices of appeal. They are appealing in the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considered the country\u2019s most conservative appeals court. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department was still reviewing Rice\u2019s ruling in Washington. Reporters Tierney Sneed and Devan Cole, CNN contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "A conservative Texas judge on Friday put a dent in the blue wall of abortion rights protections, issuing an order that could suspend approval of a drug used in medication abortions by women across the country \u2013 including in states with robust protections in place. The decision from District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk could represent the biggest blow to abortion rights in the US since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. That ruling upended the 2022 midterm elections, prompting a backlash that helped Democrats outperform expectations at almost every level of government. Kacsmaryk paused his ruling for seven days to allow the federal government to appeal, an opportunity the Justice Department, joined by the drug manufacturer, quickly said it would take. President Joe Biden slammed the decision, calling it \u201canother unprecedented step in taking away basic freedoms from women and putting their health at risk\u201d and warning that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s mission now risked being undermined by \u201cpolitical, ideological attacks.\u201d Further complicating the matter, another federal judge, in Washington state, ruled Friday that the US Food and Drug Administration could not restrict access to the drug, mifepristone, in a separate lawsuit brought by Democratic state attorneys general. Rival rulings on medication abortion hypercharge the post-Roe legal war The conflicting federal court decisions have likely produced a legal stalemate that will end up before the US Supreme Court. But the political fallout is already coming into focus, with Democrats at every level of government warning that the Trump-appointed Texas judge\u2019s ruling is both gravely unjust and another step by anti-abortion Republicans in their quest to outlaw the procedure nationwide. This long-brewing judicial clash comes just days after voters in Wisconsin flipped a state Supreme Court seat, and control of the bench, to favor liberals in a historically expensive election that largely hinged on the future of abortion rights in the state \u2013 and as political leaders in swing states around the country calculate its implications ahead of the 2024 elections. \u201cThis does not just affect women in Texas,\u201d Biden said Friday, \u201cif it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state. On Friday evening, Democrats and allied abortion advocates quickly lashed out at the Amarillo-based Texas court and a judge that the plaintiffs, led by an anti-abortion group, sought because of his previously stated opposition to abortion rights. \u201cToday\u2019s unprecedented decision threatens the rights of women nationwide to make decisions about their health care and the ability to access medication prescribed to them by their doctors,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris said. \u201cSimply put: this decision undermines the FDA\u2019s ability to approve safe and effective medications\u2014from chemotherapy drugs, to asthma medicine, to blood pressure pills, to insulin\u2014based on science, not politics.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday echoed the vice president\u2019s comments, calling the ruling an \u201cawful, extreme and unprecedented decision.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, this is about the Republicans\u2019 goal of a nationwide abortion ban,\u201d the New York Democrat said on a call with reporters. \u201cThis is about stripping away health care for millions of Americans, and this is about MAGA Republicans using the courts to enact an extreme agenda that is wildly unpopular with the American people.\u201d Schumer said Senate Democrats remain committed to passing the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a bill aimed at preserving abortion access nationwide. The legislation was blocked in the chamber last year after failing to secure enough votes to break the filibuster. It remains unlikely to pass now with Republicans in control of the House and a slim Democratic majority in the Senate. Republicans have been quieter in response, but this latest setback for abortion rights supporters is another sign of the increasingly tight grip conservatives hold on the courts \u2013 an issue poised to play an influential role in the 2024 election. Liberal judge's victory in Wisconsin Supreme Court race marks political shift in key swing state \u201cIf there was ever any doubt that GOP extremists want anything other than a ban on all abortion, everywhere, today\u2019s ruling should make it clear that they have no intention of respecting our freedoms,\u201d NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement. Democratic leaders in many states with abortion protections insisted the Texas court decision would not affect access to mifepristone, though it remains unclear how providers will interpret the opposing rulings. Ellen Rosenblum, the Democratic attorney general of Oregon, said her office was reviewing the orders but made clear this new front in the legal and political fight over abortion was only just taking shape. \u201cDon\u2019t be too distracted by the breaking news out of Texas \u2013 we got a BIG WIN in the case led by Oregon and Washington (and joined by 16 other states),\u201d Rosenblum tweeted. \u201cThe federal judge in the eastern district of Washington JUST granted our request to preserve access to Mifepristone pending the outcome of our case.\u201d Should Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling ultimately prevail, it would effectively end the two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process. But even if it falls on appeal, his attempt to overrule medical professionals at the FDA over the use of a drug that has been safely and effectively used for so long marks a fraught new chapter in post-Roe American politics. The long-standing national divide was sharpened last June by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which ended federal protections for women seeking the procedure, allowing Republican state legislators and executives to pass new restrictions or outright bans. It was a landmark victory for conservatives, but also sparked a backlash that damaged Republicans in more moderate or left-leaning states during last year\u2019s midterms. Two dramatic rulings issued on medication abortion pill \u201cDobbs was supposed to leave abortion laws up to the states. But now, unelected Republican judges are making decisions for every single person in the country. That\u2019s going to motivate voters, especially those who are feeling the impact of these anti-abortion rulings for the first time,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, the interim executive director of liberal think tank and pollster Data For Progress. Voters in Wisconsin on Tuesday made a clear statement on the potency of abortion politics when they elected liberal judge Janet Protasiewicz to the state\u2019s high court. Her victory over a conservative judge aligned with anti-abortion groups all but guaranteed that Democratic Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul\u2019s lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s abortion ban, an issue at the center of his successful 2022 reelection bid, would prevail \u2013 a key selling point during the campaign. \u201cOur state is taking a step forward to a better and brighter future where our rights and freedoms will be protected,\u201d Protasiewicz said in her victory speech this week. The Texas decision could also bring out new internal dissent within both the Democratic and Republican parties. Some liberal Democrats on Friday night argued that the White House should disregard the order and instruct the FDA to stick to its current position. \u201cI believe that the Biden administration should ignore this ruling,\u201d New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper shortly after it was issued. \u201cWhat (the courts) are currently doing is engaged in an unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez also pointed to a statement from Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who made a similar argument. \u201cThis devastating ruling has no basis in law and will ban the most common method of abortion in EVERY single state,\u201d Wyden tweeted. \u201cPresident Biden can and must ignore this ruling and keep mifepristone on the market and accessible for every woman in America.\u201d Biden tells officials he's 'definitely running' but formal announcement could wait for summer Biden now risks a row with his own party if he does not take a hard line. His response late Friday was fiery, coming with a promise to \u201cfight this ruling.\u201d But even as he derided it as \u201cthe next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican elected officials have vowed to make law in America,\u201d Biden did not immediately suggest he would direct the FDA to ignore it. Republicans could also find themselves at odds with one another as the electoral backlash following Dobbs \u2013 the ruling that overturned Roe \u2013 becomes more difficult to ignore. Former President Donald Trump, again a leading candidate for the GOP nomination, has been largely silent about abortion issues. Earlier this year, Trump appeared to blame abortion opponents for the GOP\u2019s weak midterm showing, saying that \u201cpeople that pushed so hard, for decades, against abortion, got their wish from the US Supreme Court and just plain disappeared, not to be seen again.\u201d The effects were clearest in Michigan, where a ballot measure to enshrine a right to abortion, contraception and miscarriage management overwhelmingly passed. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson \u2013 all Democrats \u2013 won reelection and Democrats flipped control of the state House and Senate. Now, though, the measure passed by nearly 57% of voters could be undercut by reduced access to a medication abortion pill, which is used in more than half of US abortions. \u201cIn this particular circumstance, what the (Texas case) plaintiffs asked for is essentially for one single judge in one district of one state to make a decision that is going to affect millions of people in all 50 states,\u201d Nessel recently told CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s incredibly scary.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

            "article_content": "Key Democrats hoping to keep abortion access a central part of the 2024 campaign are looking to the 2004 playbook of an old Republican nemesis: Karl Rove. Rove was the architect of ballot initiatives to ban gay marriage placed in swing states to boost turnout for George W. Bush. Now Democrats are pushing ballot measures and an array of other moves to try to capitalize on a backlash to last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which they say was instrumental in many of their wins in last year\u2019s midterms. \u201cWe should put the right to choose on every ballot across the country in 2024 \u2013 not just with the candidates we choose, but with referendum efforts to enshrine reproductive rights in states where right-wing politicians are stripping those rights away,\u201d Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker told CNN. With President Joe Biden expected to run for reelection and Democrats forecasting tough races for key Senate and House seats, several Democratic operatives say next year is the perfect moment to turn Rove\u2019s wedge-issue strategy on its head and get swing voters excited about abortion rights \u2013 the same way an abortion rights ballot proposition in Michigan helped power a massive blue wave in the state last year. Abortion foes take aim at ballot initiatives in next phase of post-Dobbs political fights The frustration with threats to abortion access hasn\u2019t faded, Democrats \u2013 from Biden\u2019s close advisers to organizers across the country \u2013 agree. Their proof is Tuesday\u2019s blowout win by Democrats\u2019 preferred candidate in Wisconsin. The state Supreme Court race came with high stakes for abortion access given the court is expected to decide the fate of the state\u2019s 1849 ban, which had been dormant for decades but snapped back into place with last year\u2019s US Supreme Court ruling. \u201cIn 2024, voters will be deciding whether to elect people who want a national abortion ban,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair in the state. \u201cRepublicans nationally will feel the fury that Wisconsin feels now.\u201d Even some conservatives are raising the alarm. After the Wisconsin election, conservative commentator Ann Coulter, referring to last summer\u2019s US Supreme Court decision, tweeted: \u201cPro-lifers: WE WON. Abortion is not a \u2018constitutional right\u2019 anymore!\u201d She suggested that new abortion restrictions are backfiring on the GOP. \u201cPlease stop pushing strict limits on abortion, or there will be no Republicans left,\u201d she added. Rove didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats invoking him in their political strategy. But Democrats are counting on new restrictions being pushed by Republicans in Congress and in many state legislatures \u2013 including a ban on abortions after six weeks that could soon head to the desk of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who\u2019s in final deliberations about launching a presidential campaign \u2013 to keep stoking fresh backlash. That will only be accentuated, they argue, if a Texas judge\u2019s ruling in a pending case leads to a restriction in access to a common abortion medication, even in states where the procedure is legal. Some in the party continue to push for economic issues to be their preeminent message. But abortion rights advocates and top Democratic operatives say they\u2019ll look to tie every Republican candidate \u2013 for president all the way down the ticket \u2013 to the hardest-line abortion restrictions, which polls show are broadly unpopular. And they\u2019ll do it, they say, by tapping into what they think is a more widely resonant argument about bringing people together to push back on government overreach and stripping them of their rights. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to take this fight directly to the people,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cLet\u2019s make the choice for voters in 2024 crystal clear.\u201d The ballot propositions are part of a patchwork, ad hoc strategy that collections of activists, advocates and operatives are sorting out on the state and local levels, as they wait for Biden to make a final decision about running and setting the tone for a national campaign. More than 20 lieutenant governors, for example, led by Connecticut\u2019s Susan Bysiewicz, have started a coalition to share tactics and information as they push to protect abortion rights in their states. And groups of Democratic state attorneys general have come together in joint lawsuits aimed at trying to undermine a possible decision from the Texas judge against the abortion pill. In New York \u2013 where six Republicans who represent congressional districts where Biden won in 2020 are top targets for the party nationally \u2013 the Democratic-dominated state legislature has already put a measure on the ballot for next year. Maryland legislators moved to add their own proposal to the 2024 ballot at the end of March. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it will energize voters to fight for their fundamental rights,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN. Hochul, a Democrat who convened a special session of the state legislature last year after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, said that even though abortion rights didn\u2019t appear to move many voters in her very blue state last year, there\u2019s still a need for abortion rights politicians to push for more. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the terrifying ways other states are trying to roll back reproductive rights, and we know it\u2019s up to us to fight back,\u201d said Hochul. There\u2019s a burgeoning effort by some abortion rights activists in Florida for a potential ballot proposition there, and the process is already well underway in the key battleground state of Arizona, as well as in Colorado. Efforts are also underway in Montana, people advising them tell CNN, and in Nevada \u2013 each of which will have a Senate race that could determine the majority. Activists are also expecting Republicans to try get an abortion proposition on the ballot in Iowa, where state legislators are advancing a proposition that would impose new restrictions. Asked if Pritzker would be funding ballot proposition efforts in other states, a spokesperson for the billionaire governor pointed to his past financial support of the issue, including in last year\u2019s ballot initiative in Michigan and in support of the Democrats\u2019 preferred Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate. Nationally, Biden advisers say that Vice President Kamala Harris will take the lead on the abortion issue \u2013 as she did in the 2022 midterms \u2013 in the plans for a reelection campaign while the president would also push to codify Roe v. Wade as part of his own pitch. Harris is planning to expand her national tour on reproductive rights, like her trip to Iowa in March, which was specifically geared to call attention to the Republican presidential candidates who\u2019ve been landing in the state. Harris aides say she has been keeping tabs on the medication abortion case out of Texas, warning fellow Democrats about the consequences for other medications if this Food and Drug Administration approval is reversed, but has also been reaching out behind the scenes \u2013 checking with legislators who\u2019ve protected abortion rights in their states and with Virginia state Sen. Aaron Rouse about how talking about abortion rights helped him win a January special election that flipped a seat. \u201cPeople around our country are concerned, afraid, confused, desperate, in many ways feeling alone,\u201d Harris said recently as she met with Iowa state legislators who support abortion rights in Des Moines. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who survived a tight reelection last year in which she spoke often about abortion rights, argues that the way to appeal to Republican voters and independents is to talk about how the GOP is being taken over by extremists. \u201cIt is such a personal, emotional, important issue for people that my colleagues on the far right do not understand why it will continue to resonate,\u201d Cortez Masto said. That\u2019s in line with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, the two national nonpartisan groups at the forefront of organizing the ballot proposition campaigns in 2022 and as well as those taking shape for 2024. (The ACLU just spent $900,000 on its own radio ads in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.) There\u2019s a natural fit, operatives at both groups say, in talking about taking back power from governments that took rights away. \u201cWe continue to see a lot of promise in appealing directly to voters who are so with us on this on the issue,\u201d said ACLU senior political strategist Carolyn Ehrlich, arguing the ballot propositions from last year are \u201ca roadmap for protecting rights in states where the legislature is a roadblock to progress.\u201d Ballot propositions that would have further restricted abortion were defeated last year in deep-red states like Kansas and Kentucky \u2013 major victories for abortion rights advocates. And after Republicans fell short of their hopes of a \u201cred wave\u201d in the midterms, those advocates and aligned operatives argue that the GOP has largely been pushed into a corner. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have to nuance anything to voters. What we\u2019re going to have to do is to communicate to voters where the parties stand,\u201d said EMILY\u2019s List President Laphonza Butler. New attacks on reproductive rights will only further enrage and mobilize their voters, said NARAL President Mini Timmaraju. \u201cEvery single candidate for public office next year will have no choice but to go on the record with their position, and we\u2019ll be there to hold them accountable or lift them up,\u201d Timmaraju said. Talking about abortion has already proven complicated for the emerging Republican presidential field. Former President Donald Trump, whose three Supreme Court nominees helped overturn Roe v. Wade, lashed out after the midterms to say \u201c\u2018the abortion issue\u2019\u201d was \u201cpoorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on no exceptions.\u201d Former Vice President Mike Pence has remained an advocate of a national abortion ban. Other prospective candidates have stopped short of that while making announcements of their own: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin has pushed a 15-week ban in his state \u2013 except in the case of rape, incest and the health of the mother \u2013 as he eyes a potential moderate lane in the race. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who has announced her candidacy, says she wouldn\u2019t support a full federal ban but has expressed openness to the 15-week federal ban for most abortions introduced last year by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, though she hasn\u2019t taken a firm position. Fellow South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, asked on Fox News earlier this month about the bill in his state that would allow the death penalty to be imposed on women who receive abortions, said it was \u201ca terrible idea\u201d and then quickly shut down the conversation. A spokesperson for Scott, whose travel schedule in recent months has looked like that of a likely presidential candidate, did not respond to a CNN interview request to elaborate. Similar bills are being introduced by Republican legislators in several other states, including ones that would reclassify abortion as murder and ones that could apply \u201cwrongful death\u201d to embryos frozen as part of IVF fertility treatments. Anti-abortion activists aren\u2019t leaving much room for compromise. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser declared in a call with reporters in January that any Republican who doesn\u2019t back a federal abortion ban or restrictions that moved toward one has \u201cdisqualified him or herself as a presidential candidate in our eyes.\u201d That applies for candidates for other offices too, Dannenfelser warned. And, she said, she wants candidates speaking loudly and clearly about more restrictions they\u2019d support rather than trying to avoid the issue. To do otherwise, she said, would be an \u201costrich strategy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "North Carolina Republicans gained a veto-proof supermajority in the state House after a Charlotte-area Democrat announced Wednesday she was switching parties. State Rep. Tricia Cotham, who won as a Democrat in her blue district last fall by nearly 20 points, said at a news conference in Raleigh that \u201cthe modern-day Democratic Party has become unrecognizable to me.\u201d \u201cI am no longer a Democrat, but I remain a public servant, that is what I am called to do. The party that represents me and my principles and what is best for North Carolina is the Republican Party,\u201d Cotham, wearing a red dress and surrounded by her new Republican colleagues, said outside the state GOP headquarters in Raleigh. \u201cI am a single mom of two amazing sons, a teacher, a small-business owner, a woman with strong faith, a national championship basketball coach, and a public servant. Today I add Republican to that list,\u201d she said, noting that she had \u201cbeen welcomed with open arms\u201d by her new colleagues. Cotham\u2019s switch could have major implications for lawmaking in the Tar Heel State. Republicans already held a supermajority in the North Carolina Senate. Cotham\u2019s flip gives them 72 seats in the state House \u2013 and enough votes in both chambers to override any veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Cotham\u2019s plan to switch parties was first reported by Axios. CNN has reached out to Cotham about the party switch. Cotham served in the state House as a Democrat for nearly a decade before stepping away in 2016. She ran again in 2022, winning a crowded Democratic primary and then the general election for the newly drawn House District 112 in southeastern Mecklenburg County. At the news conference Wednesday, Cotham said that \u201cthe turning point for me was when I was criticized for using the American flag and the praying hands emoji on all my social media platforms and even on the back of different vehicles that I have.\u201d \u201cI really could not believe that that was the conversations that was happening at that time, and I was deeply offended,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cto say that that is wrong and not to be able to show off a flag because the others hijack it for something else, why are we at this place in politics?\u201d North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement Wednesday that Cotham\u2019s announcement \u201ccontinues to reflect that the Democratic Party is too radical for North Carolina.\u201d \u201cThe values of the Republican Party align with voters, and the People of Mecklenburg County should be proud to have her representation in Raleigh,\u201d he said. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also welcomed Cotham to the GOP, saying in a statement Wednesday, \u201cEven in a Biden district in a purple state, Democrats are reading the writing on the wall: liberal policies are too extreme and they\u2019re failing Americans.\u201d Democrats reacted to Cotham\u2019s decision with anger and disappointment. \u201cRep. Cotham\u2019s votes on women\u2019s reproductive freedom, election laws, LGBTQ rights and strong public schools will determine the direction of the state we love. It\u2019s hard to believe she would abandon these long held principles and she should still vote the way she has always said she would vote when these issues arise, regardless of party affiliation,\u201d Cooper said in the statement to CNN on Tuesday. The White House also weighed in on Cotham\u2019s switch. \u201cBedrock American freedoms are at stake in votes the North Carolina legislature is taking,\u201d spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. \u201cWe sincerely hope that all members of the state house and state senate listen to their conscience \u2013 instead of politics \u2013 and put North Carolinians\u2019 rights and the safety of their communities first.\u201d Newly elected North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton called on Cotham to resign from her seat. \u201cRep. Cotham\u2019s decision to switch parties is a deceit of the highest order. It is a betrayal to the people of Mecklenburg County, with repercussions not only for the people of her district, but for the entire state of North Carolina,\u201d Clayton said at a Wednesday news conference in Raleigh outside party headquarters with other Democrats and residents of Cotham\u2019s district. \u201cReproductive freedoms are on the line. Our public schools are on the line. LGBTQ rights are on the line. Voting rights are on the line. Our future as a state is on the line.\u201d \u201cThis is not about political vendettas. This is about the constituents that trusted Rep. Cotham to champion their values, who are now left with little reassurance that she will do that,\u201d Clayton added. \u201cHD112 is a 60% Democratic district, y\u2019all. And they did not choose to elect a Republican. They chose to elect a Democrat.\u201d Cameron Pruette, the chair of the LGBTQ+ Democrats of Mecklenburg County, said at the news conference, \u201cI knew there was a problem, when we invited Tricia Cotham to the Human Rights Campaign dinner a few weeks ago, she didn\u2019t show up. Is this a premeditated move? How long has she known? The voters deserve to know.\u201d US Rep. Jeff Jackson, a former state senator who represents parts of Mecklenburg County, tweeted Wednesday that Cotham\u2019s decision represented a \u201cpolitical earthquake\u201d that \u201cwill have major consequences for millions of people.\u201d \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know how she will vote on any given bill, dozens of bills that were essentially dead \u2013 from elections law changes to reproductive freedom to LGBTQ rights to education policy \u2013 may have just sprung back to life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the state budget - which controls education funding - can now be passed entirely on the basis of Republican votes.\u201d \u201cThere are no recall provisions in North Carolina. She will be able to serve her full two-year term, which just began in January. For that period, Republicans will now be in full control,\u201d Jackson said. Cotham\u2019s campaign website, which still listed her as a Democrat as of Wednesday afternoon, touted priorities such as protecting voting rights, affordable housing, health care and equitable public schools, among other issues. Under a section entitled \u201cEquality for All,\u201d Cotham calls herself a \u201cchampion of LGBTQ+ rights\u201d and states, \u201cRight now, LGBTQ+ youth are under attack by Republican state legislatures across the country. I will stand strong against discriminatory legislation and work to pass more protections at the state level.\u201d Cotham ran for election last year with the endorsement of EMILY\u2019s List, which backs female Democratic supporters of abortion rights. Last week, North Carolina Republicans overrode Cooper\u2019s veto to enact legislation softening permit requirements for pistol purchases. The absence of three Democrats in the state House, including Cotham, allowed Republicans to push through the override. This story has been updated with additional information.

            "article_content": "The victory of a liberal judge in Tuesday\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election marks a significant political realignment toward the left in a crucial swing state, potentially closing the door on an era of Republican dominance with issues such as abortion rights at stake. With liberals now poised to effectively control the seven-judge court, Democrats are newly optimistic about saving abortion access in the state, establishing a firewall against any Republican challenges to the 2024 elections and potentially redoing GOP-drawn state legislative and congressional maps. That combination of issues proved a potent force in a race that attracted massive turnout and spending. And as they did in last year\u2019s midterms in some places around the country, Democrats, once again, appear to have capitalized on a broad backlash to the US Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade and a base still energized by the specter of another Donald Trump presidency. Republican-supported Daniel Kelly lost the technically nonpartisan contest to Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz, who will begin a 10-year term this summer, effectively flipping control of the divided bench to liberals. Conservative Justice Patience Roggensack\u2019s retirement opened the seat, triggering a contentious race that attracted national attention \u2013 and donor dollars. It was the most expensive state judicial election in the country ever. \u201cAnger about Roe hasn\u2019t dissipated. Fear for our democracy remains. Voters are still alarmed by the MAGA extremism of candidates like Dan Kelly. And if this race is an early bellwether \u2013 we can safely say that Republicans didn\u2019t learn their lesson in 2022,\u201d said Sarah Dohl, the chief campaigns officer for Indivisible, a progressive advocacy group. Wisconsin has emerged as one of the country\u2019s most competitive political fronts, with ground that\u2019s expected to again be hotly contested in next year\u2019s presidential and Senate races. But the state government \u2013 outside the governor\u2019s office \u2013 has been bossed by Republicans. Since defeating GOP Gov. Scott Walker more than four years ago, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed roughly 150 bills and been hamstrung in pursuing large parts of his own agenda. Now, GOP policy gains at the state level \u2013 most notably its crushing of public sector labor unions \u2013 are in doubt. In the years before Trump\u2019s emergence, the Wisconsin GOP ran roughshod over state politics and sought to export its national playbook around the country. Walker entered the 2016 GOP presidential primary as an early favorite, pitching his state as a model for the nation. But like so many others in that year\u2019s Republican field, he never got off the blocks as Trump thundered to the nomination. That fall, Trump shattered the Democratic illusion of a \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Upper Midwest, defeating Hillary Clinton by fewer than 25,000 votes in the Wisconsin general election. But Trump\u2019s victory also triggered a backlash \u2013 and a mini Democratic resurgence at the state level. Evers was first elected governor during the 2018 Democratic wave. He won a second term last year. And though Republican Sen. Ron Johnson held his seat in 2022, Trump had lost the state two years earlier by a little more than 20,000 votes. His false allegations of 2020 election fraud infuriated Democrats, along with many swing voters, and ultimately in this year\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race hobbled Kelly, who faced blowback for his role in advising GOP officials in their efforts to hatch a fake electors scheme And while the court could find itself ruling on election laws again, abortion may the most immediate battle to reach the justices. The state\u2019s high court is expected to decide a lawsuit challenging an 1849 law that bans nearly all abortions, which had been dormant for decades but snapped back into place with last year\u2019s US Supreme Court ruling. Protasiewicz, Wisconsin Democrats and allied groups such as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Emily\u2019s List all worked to frame the race as another referendum on abortion rights. \u201cFor over a decade, anti-choice ideologues have held their iron grip on Wisconsin\u2019s highest court, leaving voters hungry for change,\u201d NARAL president Mini Timmaraju said in a statement. \u201cJudge Janet\u2019s resounding victory comes as abortion access faces an onslaught of attacks by extremist state courts determined to tear up our rights at every step.\u201d Victory for abortion rights activists follows a similar result in neighboring Michigan, which voted last fall to enshrine abortion and other reproductive rights into the state constitution while reelecting Democratic women to its three most powerful executive offices. Those results continued a streak of successes for Democrats who dug in hard on the issue \u2013 a political winner in many swing states and legislative districts. Kelly, the conservative in Wisconsin, was coy about how he would rule on a slate of potential hot-button cases, but his past writings and work for anti-abortion groups allowed Protasiewicz, who signaled her skepticism about the ban, to attack him on the issue. Her past comments also suggest a new day\u2019s dawning for the labor community and Democrats seeking to upend the state\u2019s skewed legislative maps. \u201cEverything from gerrymandering to drop boxes to Act 10 may be revisited to women\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Protasiewicz told Wisconsin Radio Network in February. (Act 10 eliminated collective bargaining for most public sector employees.) And with another presidential election on the horizon, her willingness to consider attempts to roll back or reverse restrictive voting laws or regulations could have clear national implications. The state\u2019s voter ID laws, put in place by Republicans, are among the strictest in the country. Wisconsin\u2019s high court played a pivotal role in the outcome of the 2020 election, rejecting a Trump lawsuit aimed at invalidating Joe Biden\u2019s victory \u2013 but only by a 4-3 margin with one conservative justice siding with the liberals. In the event of another challenge like that, Democrats would now only need their allies to hold the line to prevent a similar bid.",

            "article_content": "Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz will win Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court election, CNN projects, flipping majority control in liberals\u2019 favor in what could be the most consequential election of the year with abortion access, election rules and more on the line in the key swing state. Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, will defeat conservative Daniel Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, in a race that shattered spending records on state judicial elections. Her win likely breaks an era of Republican dominance in a state that has been ensnared in political conflict for more than a decade. Record-breaking Wisconsin Supreme Court race could decide abortion rights and 2024 rules in key battleground The race was a critical gauge of whether and how the issue of abortion is motivating voters nearly a year after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The state\u2019s high court is poised to settle a legal battle in the coming months over Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 law that bans abortion in nearly all circumstances. Conservatives currently hold a 4-3 majority on the court. But the retirement of conservative Justice Patience Roggensack put that majority at stake. Wisconsin is one of 14 states to directly elect its Supreme Court justices, and winners get 10-year terms. Judicial races there are nominally nonpartisan, but political parties leave little doubt as to which candidates they support. Spending in this year\u2019s race \u2013 which reached $28.8 million as of March 29, according to the Brennan Center \u2013 far surpassed the previous record for spending on a state judicial contest: $15.4 million in a 2004 Illinois race. Protasiewicz told supporters at her victory party Tuesday night that her win \u201chas obviously reignited hope in so many of us.\u201d \u201cOur state is taking a step forward to a better and brighter future, where our rights and freedoms will be protected,\u201d she said. Kelly acknowledged his defeat, telling supporters at his election night event that \u201cthis didn\u2019t turn out the way we were looking for.\u201d But he also attacked Protasiewicz, saying, \u201cI wish that in a circumstance like this, I would be able to concede to a worthy opponent. But I do not have a worthy opponent to which I can concede.\u201d Democrats saw the race as an opportunity to end Republican dominance in Wisconsin that began with Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s election in 2010 \u2013 a victory that was followed by the passage of union-busting laws and state legislative districts drawn to effectively ensure GOP majorities, all green-lit by a state Supreme Court where conservatives have held the majority since 2008. Walker lost his bid for a third term to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in 2018. But Evers has been hamstrung by the Republican-led legislature, with the conservative Supreme Court breaking ties on matters such as a 2022 ruling during the once-a-decade redistricting process in favor of using Republican-drawn legislative maps rather than ones submitted by Evers. The decision cemented Republicans\u2019 solid majority in the state legislature. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is also positioned to play a critical role in determining how the 2024 election is conducted and settling disputes that arise. The court played a pivotal role in the outcome of the 2020 election in Wisconsin: Justices voted 4-3, with conservative Brian Hagedorn joining the court\u2019s three liberals, to reject former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to throw out ballots in Democratic-leaning counties. And last year, the court barred the use of most ballot drop boxes and ruled that no one can return a ballot in person on behalf of another voter. But the most immediate battle likely to reach the justices as early as this fall is over Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 law that bans abortion in nearly all circumstances. Groups on both sides of the abortion divide poured vast sums into the race and attempted to mobilize voters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. Though the two candidates refused to say how they\u2019d rule on the issue, they left little doubt about their leanings. In a debate last month, Protasiewicz said she was \u201cmaking no promises\u201d on how she would rule. But she also noted her personal support for abortion rights, as well as endorsements from pro-abortion rights groups. And she pointed to Kelly\u2019s endorsement by Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion rights. \u201cIf my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books. I can tell you that,\u201d Protasiewicz said. Kelly, who has done legal work for Wisconsin Right to Life, shot back, saying Protasiewicz\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking about that abortion ban,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no idea. These things you do not know.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "After a string of recent ballot-box victories for abortion rights groups, opponents of the procedure are redoubling their efforts \u2013 including, in some places, pushing to make it harder to use citizen-approved ballot measures to guarantee abortion access. An anti-abortion coalition in Ohio, for instance, recently unleashed a $5 million ad buy targeting an effort to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution through a ballot initiative \u2013 just as the initiative\u2019s organizers won approval to collect signatures to put the question to voters in November. Meanwhile, legislators in Ohio and other states are weighing bills that would make it more difficult to pass citizen-initiated changes to state constitutions. The US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year left abortion laws up to the states, and abortion rights groups quickly scored wins on ballot measures in six of them \u2013 including in the battleground state of Michigan, where voters protected abortion access, and in the Republican strongholds of Kansas, Kentucky and Montana, where voters defeated efforts to restrict abortions. \u201cWhat we saw in the midterms last year was a wake-up call,\u201d said Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. She said helping local groups defeat abortion-related ballot measures is one of the top three priorities for the group\u2019s state affairs team. Record-breaking Wisconsin Supreme Court race could decide abortion rights and 2024 rules in key battleground Groups on both sides of the abortion divide have poured big sums into an upcoming state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin that has seen record spending and offers a key test of the potency of the abortion issue among voters in a battleground state. Whether a conservative or liberal candidate wins a swing seat Tuesday on the seven-member high court there could determine the fate of abortion rights in the state. A Wisconsin law, enacted in 1849, that bans nearly all abortions is being challenged in court and is likely to land before the state Supreme Court. More fights over ballot initiatives on abortion are stirring to life around the country. In addition to Ohio \u2013 where a state law banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy has been put on hold by a judge \u2013 abortion rights proponents have begun to push ballot proposals in South Dakota and Missouri. Most abortions are now illegal in those two states. And groups in at least more six states are considering citizen initiatives as a way to guarantee or expand access to abortions, said Marsha Donat, capacity building director at The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which helps progressive groups advance ballot measures. Ohio, however, looms as the next big abortion battleground on the 2023 calendar \u2013 with skirmishes already underway in the courts, the state legislature and on the airwaves. A state \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law that prohibits many abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy took effect when the US Supreme Court struck down Roe with its decision last June in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. But the law has been put on hold by a judge in Cincinnati in a case that\u2019s expected to end up before the state\u2019s high court. Abortion rights supporters recently won approval to begin collecting signatures to put a measure on the November ballot that would guarantee Ohioans\u2019 access to abortion. If approved by voters, state officials could not prohibit abortion until after fetal viability, the point at which doctors say the fetus can survive outside the womb. The initiative says that \u201cevery individual has a right to make and carry out one\u2019s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions\u201d on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one\u2019s own pregnancy, miscarriage care and abortion. It also would bar the state from interfering with an individual\u2019s \u201cvoluntary exercise of this right\u201d or that of a \u201cperson or entity that assists an individual exercising this right.\u201d Ohio abortion law meant weeks of 'anguish,' 'agony' for couple whose unborn child had organs outside her body A conservative group called Protect Women Ohio immediately launched an ad campaign \u2013 putting $4 million on the air and $1 million into digital advertising \u2013 to cast the amendment as one that would strip parents of their authority to prevent a child from having an abortion or undergoing gender reassignment surgery, although the proposed constitutional amendment makes no mention of transgender care. Officials with Protect Women Ohio argue that the initiative\u2019s language is broad enough to be interpreted as extending to gender reassignment surgery, an assertion initiative proponents say is false. In the campaign aimed at defeating the amendment, \u201cwe\u2019ll make sure they have to own every last word of this radical initiative,\u201d said Aaron Baer, the president of Center for Christian Virtue and a Protect Women Ohio board member, told CNN. \u201cThey chose this language for a reason, and we\u2019re not going to let them off the hook.\u201d Lauren Blauvelt \u2013 who chairs Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, the group promoting the initiative \u2013 said the ad \u201cis completely wrong\u201d and called it an \u201cunfortunate talking point from the other side.\u201d \u201cOur amendment \u2026 creates the fundamental right that an individual can make their own reproductive health care decisions\u201d and does not touch on other topics, she said. But the ad campaign highlights the effort to link abortion to the transgender and parental rights issues currently animating conservative activists. Susan B. Anthony\u2019s Pritchard said she believes that her side can win on the issue of limiting abortions but \u201cwe believe also that we broaden our coalition and broaden awareness of what these things actually do when we highlight the parental rights issue that is very real.\u201d The initiative\u2019s supporters need to collect more than 413,000 signatures from Ohioans by July 5 to qualify for the November ballot. Under current Ohio law, changes to the state\u2019s constitution can be approved via ballot initiative by a simple majority of voters. A bill introduced by Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart would increase that threshold to 60% and would mandate that the signatures needed to put an amendment on the ballot come from all 88 counties in the state, instead of 44, as currently required. Ohio state Senate President Matt Huffman backs raising the threshold and also supports holding an August special election to change the ballot initiative rules. If successful, the higher threshold would be in effect before November\u2019s election when voters could consider adding abortion rights to the state constitution. Neither Huffman nor Stewart responded to interview requests from CNN. Ohio lawmakers recently voted to end August special elections, citing their expense and low participation. But Huffman recently told reporters in Ohio that a special election \u2013 with a potential price tag of $20 million \u2013 would be worth the expense if it helped torpedo the abortion initiative. \u201cIf we save 30,000 lives as a result of spending $20 million, I think that\u2019s a great thing,\u201d he said, according to Cleveland.com. The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center is tracking 109 measures across 35 states that could affect initiatives put to voters in 2024. Some would increase the threshold for an initiative to pass. Others would increase the minimum number of signatures \u2013 or require that they come from a broader geographic area \u2013 before an initiative could qualify for the ballot in the first place, Donat said. Activists preparing for 'an absolutely crazy year' in first full statehouse sessions since Supreme Court overturned Roe Many of the bills that seek to make it more difficult to pass ballot initiatives do not specifically target abortion issues. But they come as progressive groups increasingly turn to the initiative process as a way to bypass Republican-controlled legislatures and put a raft of issues \u2013 from legalizing marijuana to expanding Medicaid eligibility and boosting the minimum wage \u2013 directly to voters. \u201cAttacks, through state legislatures, on the ballot measure process have been pretty consistent and pretty aggressive for the last several (election) cycles,\u201d said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which has helped pass progressive measures in red states. Hall said the abortion issue, while not the sole focus of current efforts to curb ballot initiatives, has put \u201cadditional fuel on an already burning fire.\u201d In Missouri, a state law banning most abortions \u2013 including in cases of rape and incest \u2013 took effect last year after Roe was overturned. A group called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom has filed petition language that proposes adding abortion protections to the state constitution via ballot initiative. In recent cycles, voters in Missouri have expanded Medicaid eligibility and legalized recreational marijuana use through such initiatives. This year, the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature is weighing making it harder for those initiatives to succeed. In February, the state House voted to raise the bar for amending the state constitution from a simple majority to 60%. Voters would have to approve the higher threshold. \u201cI believe the Missouri Constitution is a living document but not an ever-expanding document,\u201d Republican state Rep. Mike Henderson, the measure\u2019s sponsor, said during House floor debate. \u201cAnd right now, it has become an ever-expanding document.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The two candidates battling for a seat on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court clashed Tuesday over the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban in their lone debate, underscoring the high stakes of an election that could decide the issue in one of the nation\u2019s most important swing states. Former Justice Daniel Kelly, a conservative, and liberal opponent Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz will square off April 4 in an election that will decide the balance of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In a state where control is split between a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature, the high court could decide the outcome of legal battles over the state\u2019s abortion laws, its legislative maps and more. The debate \u2013 the only one scheduled between Protasiewicz and Kelly \u2013 took place on the same day Wisconsin voters began casting early ballots in person. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s most expensive judicial contest on record, with about $30 million already spent on advertising and counting, as there are two weeks remaining in the campaign. Wisconsin is one of 14 states in the country that directly elects Supreme Court justice in this manner. Protasiewicz focused her attacks on Kelly on abortion, with the state\u2019s 1849 ban on nearly all abortions currently being challenged in court and likely to land before the state Supreme Court. \u201cIf my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books. I can tell you that,\u201d Protasiewicz said in Tuesday\u2019s debate. She said she is \u201cmaking no promises\u201d on how she would rule on the 1849 abortion law. But she also noted her personal support for abortion rights, as well as endorsements from pro-abortion rights groups. And she pointed to Kelly\u2019s endorsement by Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion rights. Kelly shot back that Protasiewicz\u2019s comments are \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking about that abortion ban,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no idea. These things you do not know.\u201d The debate took place before a crowd of about 100 people who were seated in an auditorium at the offices of the State Bar of Wisconsin in Madison. The candidates answered questions from a panel of three Wisconsin reporters as the audience watched in silence. The rhetoric grew increasingly bitter and testy, particularly on the topics of abortion, redistricting and criminal sentencing, with the two rivals standing several feet apart on a small stage. The differences that have been aired in a multi-million television ad campaign came alive. Kelly looked directly at his opponent and repeatedly raised pointed questions about her integrity, saying at one point: \u201cThis seems to be a pattern for you, Janet, telling lies about me.\u201d He called her by her first name, Janet, rather than judge. Protasiewic only occasionally looked toward her challenger, but pushed back against an allegation that she is soft on crime: \u201cI have worked very hard to keep our community safe, each and every day I\u2019m on the bench.\u201d Kelly accused Protasiewicz of handing down light sentences to violent offenders. He cited the case of Anton Veasley, who in 2021 was convicted of child enticement and third degree sexual assault and was released after Protasiewicz stayed his five-year prison sentence with four years of probation, giving him credit for 417 days he\u2019d already spent in jail. \u201cWe look at the sentencing she has composed and the reasoning she used to reach those conclusions, and that\u2019s just irresponsible to allow dangerous convicted criminals back out so easily with no repercussions into the communities they just got done victimizing,\u201d Kelly said. Protasiewicz acknowledged that \u201chindsight is 20/20.\u201d But she said Kelly was mischaracterizing her record. \u201cI have sentenced thousands of people. And it\u2019s interesting that a handful of cases have been cherry-picked and selected and twisted, and insufficient facts have been provided to the electorate,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "In one of the nation\u2019s most important political battlegrounds, the future of election laws, abortion rights and more could hinge on the outcome of an April race for a seat that will determine control of the state Supreme Court. Power in Wisconsin \u2013 the state that was the tipping point in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections \u2013 is divided between a Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and a Republican-controlled legislature. That split has placed the state Supreme Court, where conservatives currently hold a 4-3 majority, at the center of pitched, partisan battles over several key issues, including abortion rights, election challenges, and legislative and congressional district lines. And because Wisconsin is one of 14 states to directly elect Supreme Court justices, the race between Janet Protasiewicz, the liberal Milwaukee County judge, and Daniel Kelly, the conservative former state Supreme Court justice, has shattered spending records on statewide judicial races, with more than $30 million in television advertising already flooding the state\u2019s airwaves ahead of the April 4 election. The two are battling to replace Justice Patience Roggensack, a conservative. A Protasiewicz victory would tip the balance of power on the seven-member court. Ben Wikler, chairman Wisconsin Democratic Party, said the implications of the Supreme Court race could not be overstated for the state and the nation. \u201cThis election is the most important election in the country in 2023 because Wisconsin is the tipping point state for presidential elections,\u201d Wikler said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cWhoever wins the Supreme Court race will cast the deciding vote on questions like voting rights decisions, our abortion ban and even potentially whether to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential election.\u201d The court played a pivotal role in the outcome of Wisconsin\u2019s 2020 election: Justices voted 4-3, with conservative Brian Hagedorn joining the court\u2019s three liberals, to reject former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to throw out ballots in Democratic-leaning counties. The court has also shaped Wisconsin\u2019s election laws. It has voted in recent years to prohibit ballot drop boxes and have selected maps that cemented Republicans\u2019 solid majority in the state legislature. The April 4 election will set the stage for the 2024 presidential race, with the court likely to be asked to weigh in again on election rules, including the state\u2019s voter identification law, and potentially sort through another round of legal challenges afterward. Those high stakes have turned the state Supreme Court race into one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched contests of 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be close,\u201d former President Barack Obama said Tuesday in a tweet urging Wisconsin voters to cast their ballots early. The race\u2019s focal point, though, has been abortion, after the state\u2019s 1849 law banning abortion in nearly all cases took effect in the wake of the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade and leave abortion laws up to the states. A lawsuit challenging that 1849 law could reach the state Supreme Court as soon as this fall. And while the two candidates are refusing to say how they\u2019d rule, they\u2019re leaving little doubt about their leanings. In their lone debate Tuesday, Protasiewicz said she is \u201cmaking no promises\u201d on how she would rule. But she also noted her personal support for abortion rights, as well as endorsements from pro-abortion rights groups. And she pointed to Kelly\u2019s endorsement by Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion rights. \u201cIf my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books. I can tell you that,\u201d Protasiewicz said. Kelly shot back that Protasiewicz\u2019s comments are \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking about that abortion ban,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no idea. These things you do not know.\u201d Still, pro-abortion rights and anti-abortion forces have poured money and volunteer hours into the race. Gracie Skogman, the legislative director for Wisconsin Right to Life, said hundreds of volunteers across the state were mobilizing around the Supreme Court contest because of their deep opposition to abortion. She conceded it was a challenge making people aware of the April 4 election, but said voters would be motivated to suppport Kelly. \u201cWe have a massive base \u2013 thousands of people all across the state \u2013 but we need to get them to turn out,\u201d Skogman said in an interview. \u201cFrom a pro-life perspective, there is more at stake in this election than ever before in our state.\u201d Even though Kelly has not explicitly said he would oppose an expansion of abortion rights, Skogman said his history on the issue made her group comfortable that he would. \u201cOur endorsement is based on his judicial philosophy,\u201d Skogman said. \u201cJudge Kelly is very clear that he does not believe in legislating from the bench and he seeks to uphold our state constitution. And that is what makes us confident in his endorsement.\u201d Protasiewicz has been on the ballot before, during her bids for Milwaukee County judge, but has never faced a statewide election. For months, her campaign aired television ads trying to teach Wisconsin voters how to say her name, literally spelling out the pronunciation on screen: \u201cPro-tuh-say-witz!\u201d In an interview at the state Capitol on Tuesday, following her debate with Kelly, she said the high stakes of the election have not been overstated \u2013 from abortion policy, gerrymandering and voting laws. \u201cThe results of the 2024 presidential election are likely to come in front of the Supreme Court as well,\u201d Protasiewicz told CNN. \u201cThe 10 electoral votes that we have here are very, very highly sought after.\u201d She has dramatically outspent her opponent, largely due to a multi-million dollar infusion from the Wisconsin Democratic Party. If she wins, she has pledged to recuse herself from cases directly involving the party. But she said she would not step aside on cases involving the next presidential election. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think the Democratic Party would be one of the plaintiffs or respondents in that case,\u201d she said. \u201cLast time, I believe it was Trump v. Biden, so I don\u2019t think the party itself would be a party to the matter.\u201d Asked whether that was drawing a distinction without a difference, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cI could probably still even be fair on cases involving the party, but I just think the optics are really poor,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want the citizens to absolutely believe that their Supreme Court is fair, impartial and acting with integrity and independence.\u201d She has declined to say how she would rule in specific cases, including the state\u2019s 1849 law effectively banning abortion across Wisconsin, but said her decisions would \u201cuphold her values.\u201d She has made clear she supports abortion rights and believes the state law in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade is wrong. She has painted her rival as an extremist, airing ads about his involvement with the state Republican Party\u2019s scheme to create a fake slate of electors for Trump. \u201cHe is a total threat to our democracy,\u201d Protasiewicz said, reprising a central mantra of her campaign. In an interview on Wednesday, Kelly dismissed the suggestion as \u201cscaremongering\u201d and accuses his rival of placing politics above the law. \u201cWe have a very stark choice ahead of us,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWill we continue with the rule of law or will we instead trade it in for the rule of Janet?\u201d He brushed aside criticism of his previous employment with the Wisconsin Republican Party and the Republican National Committee. He described them merely as his legal clients. He said the 2024 presidential campaign \u2013 and Wisconsin\u2019s 10 electoral votes \u2013 should not be part of the discussion in the Supreme Court race. \u201cI have no idea what this might do for the 2024 presidential elections, nor is it relevant to this race,\u201d Kelly told CNN. \u201cOur only job is to resolve the legal questions the people of Wisconsin bring to us and we do it according to the existing law, without reference to its political implications.\u201d While he has been endorsed by three of the state\u2019s largest anti-abortion groups, Kelly said he made no promises to them and has not indicated how he would rule on any cases before the court. \u201cThe conversations that I\u2019ve had with them are the same conversations I\u2019ve had with literally everyone else in the state of Wisconsin: What kind of jurist would you be they asked me?\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI told them I\u2019m the kind of jurist who applies the law as it currently exists to the extent it\u2019s consistent with the Constitution. And I do it without regard to my personal views or personal politics.\u201d He said the millions of dollars that have come into the state from outside liberal groups were misguided and could backfire, saying: \u201cWe can take care of our own business here in Wisconsin just fine.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say if Janet wins, she will be forever known as the jurist who is bought and paid for by the Democratic Party in Wisconsin,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI want no part of that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Jennifer McClellan, a former Virginia state senator, was sworn in on Tuesday, becoming the first Black woman to represent the commonwealth in Congress. Her ascent to the House of Representatives is a milestone for Virginia, a state that was once home to the capital of the Confederacy and is a former slave-trading center. McClellan joins a divided Congress, in which Republicans control the House of Representatives, making the possibility of passing Democratic-backed priorities slim. In an emotional speech on the House floor following her swearing in, McClellan recounted her rise in politics as the \u201cdaughter and granddaughter of men who paid poll taxes and the great granddaughter of a man who took a literacy test and had to find three White men to vouch for him to be able to vote.\u201d \u201cI stand on the shoulders of my parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, recognizing that in a lot of ways I am fighting the same fights that they did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I stand here to ensure that my children and yours don\u2019t have to fight those same fights.\u201d McClellan\u2019s election also adds to what is already a record number of women and women of color in Congress, and sets a new record for the number of Black women, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. In February, McClellan won Virginia\u2019s special election to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin, who died in November. She defeated Republican Leon Benjamin, a pastor and Navy veteran, in the heavily Democratic 4th Congressional District that had been held by McEachin since 2017. In her remarks Tuesday, McClellan said that while she is succeeding McEachin, she can never replace the lawmaker \u201cwho was a friend, mentor and colleague whom I served with in the Virginia House of Delegates and succeeded in the Senate of Virginia.\u201d She told CNN on the campaign trail that in becoming the first Black woman to represent the commonwealth, \u201cit\u2019s a tremendous honor but it\u2019s also a tremendous responsibility because I need to make sure I\u2019m not the last.\u201d \u201cI have a responsibility to be a mentor and help pave the way for other Black women, whether it\u2019s, you know, running for federal office or running at local or state and to just help as many as I can to succeed,\u201d McClellan said after casting her ballot in February. While in the Virginia General Assembly, McClellan pushed legislation on gun control, abortion rights and education. She previously told CNN that she plans to continue her work on these issues, including voting rights and reaffirmed her plans on Tuesday. \u201cI learned in the general assembly here in Virginia, I was in the minority for 14 years, and I learned just be persistent,\u201d McClellan told Don Lemon on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d while touting her work on the Voting Rights Act of Virginia. She spearheaded the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 and aimed to eliminate voter suppression and intimidation in the commonwealth. Raised in Petersburg, Virginia, McClellan was elected to the House of Delegates in 2005 and won a 2017 special election for state Senate after McEachin was elected to Congress in 2016. In 2020, she launched a bid for governor, eventually coming in third in the 2021 Democratic primary. This story has been updated with remarks from McClellan. CNN\u2019s Jack Forrest contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Jennifer McClellan easily won the special election for Virginia\u2019s 4th Congressional District last week. The fact that a Democrat comfortably retained a Democratic seat in a district President Joe Biden would have won under its new lines by 36 points in 2020 is not surprising. What is notable is that McClellan didn\u2019t just win, she outperformed Biden\u2019s 2020 margin by 13 points. It\u2019s part of a pattern in special elections this year that suggests that the national environment may be friendlier to Democrats than Biden\u2019s sub-50% job approval rating would indicate. Jennifer McClellan will win special election and become Virginia's first Black congresswoman, CNN projects So far in 2023, besides McClellan\u2019s race, there have been 12 special elections for state legislative seats in which at least one Democrat ran against at least one Republican. And in those 12 races, Democrats have been outperforming Biden\u2019s 2020 margins by an average of 4 points. Now, 12 isn\u2019t a particularly large sample size when examining special state legislative elections, so that 4-point average swing could shift somewhat as more special elections are held. Still, a sample size of 12 isn\u2019t nothing, especially considering these elections have taken place in areas ranging from red to blue and across six states, from New Hampshire all the way down to Louisiana. And this 4-point swing to the Democrats is very much unlike what we saw in the state legislative special elections during the 2022 cycle before Roe v. Wade was overturned. In those elections, Democrats were underperforming Biden\u2019s margin by an average of 4 points. The change in special elections reminds me of what happened in early 2019. Democrats were coming off a big 2018 midterm campaign in which the special elections leading up to it were the first indication that the party was in for a big night. In state special elections in the first half of 2019, Democrats continued to outperform the party baseline from the previous presidential election, but not by anywhere close to how well they had done in specials before the 2018 midterms. Sure enough, Biden would go on in 2020 to do better than Democrats had done in 2016, though not as well as Democratic House candidates had done in 2018. Also in the first half of 2019, House Republicans easily retained control of a very red district in Pennsylvania in the first special federal election of that cycle. The result was similar to how House Democrats did in Virginia last week \u2013 easily winning a very Democratic seat in the first congressional special election of 2023. That big Republican win in Pennsylvania in 2019 wasn\u2019t surprising, but what was so out of character was how the result nearly matched the GOP baseline set in the previous presidential election. This was very unlike the vast majority of special federal elections in the 2018 cycle and presaged a tight 2020 presidential election. Let\u2019s not forget, too, that Democrats did do better than the 2020 baseline in the special elections last year following the overturning of Roe v. Wade (though generally not by the same degree as the result in Virginia last week). This foreshadowed a stronger-than-expected midterm election for the party in control of the White House. Of course, it\u2019s still very early in the current election cycle. There\u2019s a lot of time for things to shift between now and the 2024 general election. But, for the moment at least, congressional and state legislative elections aren\u2019t the only ones in which Democrats have been doing well. Liberal and conservative advance to general election for high-stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court race, CNN projects Indeed, if you want an idea of how the current political environment could make a difference in a swing state, look no further than one of the most important swing states: Wisconsin. The Badger State held a nonpartisan primary last week for a critical state Supreme Court seat. This race \u2013 to succeed a retiring conservative \u2013 will determine whether liberals or conservatives hold the majority on the bench and could affect rulings on abortion and gerrymandering, among other issues. Two liberals and two conservatives ran in the primary, which had an unusually high turnout. A liberal and a conservative have advanced to the April general election, but the two liberals combined beat the two conservatives combined by 8 points \u2013 in a state Biden won by less than a percentage point in 2020. Were that result to hold in April, it would mark one of the most important judicial election wins for liberals in the country this century. We\u2019ll just have to wait to see if this blue tint we\u2019re witnessing in a small cross-section of elections across the country continues to hold true as the year goes on.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday will release his book, \u201cThe Courage to be Free,\u201d to much anticipation ahead of his expected plunge into the 2024 presidential race. But it\u2019s not the first time DeSantis has dabbled in authorship to jumpstart his political ambitions. As a little-known Navy prosecutor on the cusp of a bid for a Jacksonville-area congressional seat, DeSantis in 2011 released the audaciously titled \u201cDreams from Our Founding Fathers.\u201d He has joked that the book \u2013 from an obscure publisher that mostly dealt in children\u2019s titles and a thriller series produced by a middle school principal \u2013 received little acclaim and was \u201cread by about a dozen people.\u201d Unlike most entries in the political genre, it\u2019s not a memoir and its autobiographical content is sparse. Rather, it\u2019s a lengthy critique of Barack Obama\u2019s political ascent and presidency, affixed on the hypothesis that the policies and philosophies of the country\u2019s first Black executive diverged dramatically from the \u201cenduring truths that the Constitution\u2019s creators relied upon when they framed America\u2019s foundational document.\u201d It litigates the case by contrasting the then-president\u2019s beliefs and background (pulling often from the Democrat\u2019s own best-selling 1995 autobiography, \u201cDreams from My Father\u201d) with the writings of the Founding Fathers. It\u2019s an instructive window into DeSantis\u2019 governing beliefs, which at times seem to collide with his current leadership style but may soon inform his platform as he seeks higher office. It shows the early seeds of his disdain for the media, strongly suggests Christianity is foundational to the Constitution and demonstrates his early willingness to buck establishment forces in his own party. As was the time, the book also serves as a full-throated defense of the tea party movement while eviscerating the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law signed by Obama that provoked Republicans across the country \u2013 including DeSantis \u2013 to run for office. But it also makes historical arguments for the preservation of slavery and touches on Obama\u2019s roots and Muslim outreach in ways that Democrats have already amplified ahead of DeSantis\u2019 expected run for president. Here are four takeaways from the book. DeSantis\u2019 views on the country\u2019s founding document and the reach of the federal government is informed heavily by the Federalist Papers, the essays produced by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay to persuade New York to ratify the US Constitution. DeSantis writes that these essays represent \u201cthe single best source for the exposition of the principles underlying the Constitution of the United States of America.\u201d It\u2019s these writings that often buttress DeSantis\u2019 criticisms of Obama and his insistence that the Democrat\u2019s vision of America is antithetical to its foundational document. To DeSantis, the very notion of a \u201ctransformative\u201d presidency flies in the face of the static role of the executive envisioned by the Framers. (The word \u201ctransform\u201d appears 75 times throughout the short work.) In his book, DeSantis argued that the Constitution\u2019s creators expected representatives to be responsive \u2013 though not beholden \u2013 to public opinion, especially when pursuing far-reaching pieces of legislation. As it is, DeSantis said, Obama and his allies should have looked at the decades of opposition to health care reform as a sign not to mess with it. DeSantis as governor, though, has often eschewed public opinion when taking actions and has proudly declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lead based on polls.\u201d For example, DeSantis signed the most restrictive abortion law in Florida\u2019s modern history despite consistent support for making the procedure accessible to women. It\u2019s not the only inconsistent view on leadership between DeSantis the author and DeSantis the politician. DeSantis also took great umbrage at descriptions of Obama \u201ccasting his candidacy as one of singular historical significance and himself as a messianic figure.\u201d But his own closing message to Florida voters last fall came in a 90-second video that suggested he was made by God on the eighth day to be a \u201cfighter.\u201d He also compared Obama with George Washington, who, DeSantis wrote, possessed \u201ca deep sense of humility, a humility that dovetailed superbly with the ethos of republican government.\u201d And he noted that the Founding Fathers warned of a demagogue leader who \u201ccapitalizes on popular prejudices by peddling false claims, by employing questionable rhetorical techniques, or by intentionally sowing divisions among different factions or interests within the body politic.\u201d DeSantis as a Republican primary candidate for governor in 2018 campaigned almost exclusively on his endorsement from then-President Donald Trump, who often peddled false claims and once claimed, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d DeSantis at one point accused Obama of not paying fealty to the Constitution with the same vigor as his predecessors and suggested it was because of Obama\u2019s inability to look beyond the codification of slavery at the nation\u2019s birth. DeSantis wrote that after the 2010 midterms, \u201ca noticeably agitated Obama even declared, \u2018I couldn\u2019t go through the front door at this country\u2019s founding\u2019 \u201d \u2013 an opinion DeSantis called \u201cseriously flawed.\u201d DeSantis throughout the book is dismissive of criticism that the Founding Fathers are tainted by their failure to end the enslavement of Black Americans, and he described the preservation of slavery and the three-fifths compromise as necessary to ensure the passage of the Constitution \u2013 \u201ca view shared by strongly anti-slavery delegates like Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSlavery had been a fact of life throughout human history, and had existed in Britain\u2019s American colonies for 150 years before the Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. In certain southern states, slave labor was the backbone of the entire economy, and immediately abolishing slavery would have represented an enlightened but also a monumental change \u2013 a revolution far more socially, politically and economically momentous than the American Revolution itself,\u201d DeSantis wrote. \u201cThis is why there was no real chance that the Convention would abolish the peculiar institution of slavery.\u201d More recently, DeSantis has contended that the American revolution itself \u201ccaused people to question slavery\u201d and birthed abolition movements. \u201cNo one had questioned it before we decided as Americans that we are endowed by our creator with inalienable rights,\u201d DeSantis said last year. DeSantis went on to argue in his book that Obama\u2019s views were more closely aligned with the slavery defender Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, who lost the 1860 presidential election to Abraham Lincoln, than the great emancipator. \u201cThough Obama made every attempt to draw comparisons between himself and Lincoln, it is actually one of Lincoln\u2019s foremost political adversaries and one of Obama\u2019s predecessors, Stephen A. Douglas, who argued like Obama that the Founders meant to exclude non-whites from the natural rights clarion call contained in the Declaration of Independence.\u201d DeSantis would use this rhetorical trick again in the book to accuse Obama of ascribing to \u201cthe same doctrine that Chief Justice Taney invoked in Dred Scott\u201d \u2013 the Supreme Court case that found enslaved African Americans could not claim citizenship and didn\u2019t enjoy the rights ascribed by the Constitution. This criticism of slavery\u2019s perversions clouding constitutional judgment extended to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the country\u2019s first Black justice, DeSantis contended. DeSantis took issue with Marshall\u2019s criticism of the Framers on the grounds that \u201cthe government they devised was defective from the start.\u201d DeSantis wrote: \u201cSuch criticism misses the mark.\u201d At the time DeSantis published his book, few topics animated voters like the 2010 passage of Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. DeSantis accused the law\u2019s champions of putting \u201cAmerica on a course to a government-run, single-payer system\u201d \u2013 a warning that has yet to materialize, though several Democratic candidates for president ran on such a policy during the 2020 election. DeSantis\u2019 opposition to \u201cObamaCare\u201d isn\u2019t surprising on its face. As a lawmaker, he voted often with his Republican colleagues to repeal the Affordable Care Act and he was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, which helped orchestrate a federal government shutdown aimed at defunding the law. But unlike some Republicans, who at times voiced support for the law\u2019s more popular provisions (like the requirement for insurance to cover children until age 26), DeSantis\u2019 opposition appeared wholesale. \u201cInitially justified by Obama as a needed remedy for the problem of rising health care costs that hurt members of the middle class, the post-passage euphoria revealed a different, more controversial justification for a federal overhaul of the health care system: the redistribution of wealth,\u201d DeSantis wrote. Even the requirement for insurance companies to cover adults and children with pre-existing conditions appeared problematic to DeSantis because it could lead to higher insurance costs. \u201cThough this sounded noble, the law had the effect of undermining insurance coverage for children,\u201d DeSantis contended. \u201cBy mandating that insurers take on more risk than is economically justifiable, ObamaCare forced insurers either to absorb financial losses or else increase premiums for all policies.\u201d DeSantis in his book laid out a blueprint for leadership that is rigidly confined to a strict reading of the Constitution and adherence to \u201cfundamental law with stable meaning.\u201d This includes limitations on the executive branch\u2019s abilities and a rigorous adherence to separation of powers. As governor, DeSantis has at times flouted seemingly similar constraints on executive power that he often charged Obama with crossing in his book. For example, he accused Obama\u2019s then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using \u201cher power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn\u2019t like. This illustrates the progressive impulse to centralize authority in bureaucratic arrangements at its apogee.\u201d But as governor, DeSantis issued an eerily similar warning to businesses not to get in his way, or else. \u201cIf you are in one of these corporations, if you\u2019re a woke CEO, you want to get involved in our legislative business, look, it\u2019s a free country,\u201d DeSantis said in 2021. \u201cBut understand, if you do that, I\u2019m fighting back against you. And I\u2019m going to make sure that people understand your business practices, and anything I don\u2019t like about what you\u2019re doing.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson Disney certainly learned. After Disney opposed a state measure restricting certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity, DeSantis went after the company\u2019s special taxing authority. Earlier this month, state lawmakers voted to give DeSantis new powers over the government that controls the land around Disney\u2019s Orlando-area theme parks. This orthodoxy, though, is also built on a belief that the federal government\u2019s powers are far more limited than what is delegated to the states. Does this mean that DeSantis would chart a new path as president, were he to ascend to the highest office? Or does he believe that the \u201ctransformational\u201d presidency he so maligned has changed the office for good in ways that he intends to follow. Maybe his next book will hold some of these answers.",

            "article_content": "Liberal Janet Protasiewicz and conservative Daniel Kelly will advance to the general election for a pivotal Wisconsin state Supreme Court seat, CNN projected Tuesday. The nonpartisan primary featured two liberals and two conservatives in an expensive and high-stakes contest to effectively break a deadlock between the state\u2019s Democratic governor and Republican-controlled legislature in a key battleground state. Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, and Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, will now face off in the April 4 general election for a seat on a court where conservatives currently hold a 4-3 majority. Although no party labels were on the ballot, interest groups aligned, party operations mobilized and money flooded into the race as if it were a partisan campaign. The departure of a conservative justice, Patience Roggensack, has given liberals an opportunity to seize the majority on a court that could decide on issues such as abortion, redistricting, and voting rights ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Conservatives have controlled the state\u2019s high court for 14 years \u2013 a span in which the court has sided with Republicans\u2019 union-busting efforts and affirmed voting restrictions, including ID requirements and a ban on ballot drop boxes. \u201cThis seat is crucial to the balance of the court, and the court is crucial to the balance of the state,\u201d said Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of its Elections Research Center. The other candidates in Tuesday\u2019s primary were conservative Jennifer Dorow, a judge perhaps best known for presiding over the trial of a man convicted of killing six and injuring scores more in a 2021 attack on a Christmas parade in Waukesha, and Everett Mitchell, a liberal circuit judge in Dane County. Outside money flooded the race. As of Thursday afternoon, orders for TV and radio ads focused on the race had hit $7 million, according to advertising tracked by Kantar Media/CMAG for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. Experts say the spending on the race could smash the previous record \u2013 $15.2 million spent on a 2004 Illinois Supreme Court race, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center \u2013 for the most expensive campaign for a single state Supreme Court seat. The court could become the final arbiter on a host of critical issues in Wisconsin in the coming years \u2013 including the fate of the state\u2019s 1849 law prohibiting abortion in nearly all cases. The US Supreme Court\u2019s decision last summer ending federal legal protections for the procedure has super-charged the rhetoric \u2013 and spending \u2013 around abortion in the Wisconsin race. The state Supreme Court could also play a crucial role in the 2024 election. Wisconsin was a key location of former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his 2020 loss, and the refusal of a conservative justice on the state Supreme Court to go along with an effort that year to toss out ballots in two heavily Democratic counties looms large in the rivalry between the two right-leaning candidates in this year\u2019s race.

            "article_content": "Virginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan will win the special election for Virginia\u2019s 4th Congressional District and will become the first Black woman to represent the commonwealth in Congress, CNN projected Tuesday. McClellan will defeat Republican Leon Benjamin, a pastor and Navy veteran, to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin, who died in November. McClellan, who was introduced at her Tuesday night victory party by Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott and walked out to Alicia Keys\u2019 \u201cGirl on Fire,\u201d hailed the pathbreaking figures, including McEachin, who paved the way for her historic ascent and promised to bring their spirit to Capitol Hill. \u201cWhen we come together and we care more about doing the work and solving the problems than the soundbites and the show,\u201d McClellan said, \u201cwe can help people. We will make this commonwealth and this country a better place for everyone.\u201d The heavily Democrat district, which comprises the city of Richmond, parts of Henrico County, Petersburg and south toward the state line, had been held by McEachin since 2017. He overwhelmingly defeated Benjamin in 2022 for the seat with 69.4% of the vote. McClellan outraised and outspent Benjamin in the lead-up to Tuesday\u2019s special election, according to their respective campaigns\u2019 pre-special election reports filed on February 9. Her election to the US House of Representatives is a milestone for Virginia, a state that was once home to the capital of the Confederacy and is a former slave-trading center. McClellan\u2019s victory will add to what is already a record number of women and women of color in Congress, and also set a new record for the number of Black women, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. On a busy Saturday ahead of the election, she greeted voters alongside Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a close ally who officiated her wedding, and local and state lawmakers. She also rallied a few dozen campaign volunteers before they went knocking on doors of potential voters and cast her ballot along with her husband, David Mills, with their two children Jackson and Samantha. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor but it\u2019s also a tremendous responsibility because I need to make sure I\u2019m not the last,\u201d McClellan said after casting her ballot. \u201cAnd, I have a responsibility to be a mentor and help pave the way for other Black women, whether it\u2019s, you know, running for federal office or running at local or state and to just help as many as I can to succeed.\u201d Raised in Petersburg, Virginia, McClellan was elected to the House of Delegates in 2005 and won a 2017 special election for state Senate after McEachin was elected to Congress in 2016. In 2020, she launched a bid for governor, eventually coming in third in the 2021 Democratic primary. Her bid for the US House was a \u201clevel up\u201d from her delegate and gubernatorial campaigns, which helped her prepare for this campaign, she told CNN. \u201cThat I had that team ready to go when the special came and it made it very easy to build a very fast campaign. And that the importance of having not only a message that resonates with voters but the resources to communicate it. That both are equally important and having the importance of a field organization, you really need all three, and I was able to pull all three together in a very short amount of time,\u201d she said. McClellan won the Democratic nomination for the 4th Congressional District in December, defeating fellow state Sen. Joe Morrissey and two other candidates in a \u201cfirehouse primary,\u201d which was conducted by party officials across a handful of pop-up voting locations. She took 85% of the vote to Morrissey\u2019s 14%, according to the Virginia Democratic Party. McClellan was backed by party leaders and groups, including House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and the moderate-backing Democratic Majority for Israel PAC. During her time in the General Assembly, McClellan has pushed legislation on several issues, including climate, gun reform and education. In 2020, a bill rolling back restrictions on abortion rights that she sponsored in the state Senate was signed into law by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat. She spearheaded the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which was signed into law in 2021 and aimed to eliminate voter suppression and intimidation in the commonwealth. McClellan also sponsored her chamber\u2019s resolution that helped Virginia become the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex and guarantees equality for women under the Constitution. (In 2022, state Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican, withdrew Virginia from a legal effort to have the Equal Rights Amendment recognized as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution.) McClellan told CNN she plans to continue her work on issues including voting rights, education and access to health care, but she may be met with challenges in the US House. Republicans\u2019 majority in the chamber makes the possibility of passing Democratic-backed priorities slim. And Republicans in the Senate, although still in the minority, have already blocked advancement of previous voting rights measures. \u201cI was in the minority party for 14 years here,\u201d McClellan said of her time in Richmond. \u201cI learned two things. One, you really need to listen and understand why people believe what they believe, where they are coming from. And when you do that, sometimes you\u2019ll find common ground,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, start from that and then see how far you can go. If you can\u2019t find common ground, then persist until you succeed, and I\u2019ve had success doing both at the state level.\u201d McClellan said she is interested in joining the Armed Services, Agriculture and Foreign Affairs Committees, though said she\u2019d be \u201chappy with whatever I get.\u201d She said she is also excited to join the Congressional Black Caucus. This story has been updated with McClellan\u2019s remarks. CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "What\u2019s typically an under-the-radar judicial election in Wisconsin has turned into a high-stakes and expensive fight for control of the state\u2019s Supreme Court \u2013 with the future of abortion, voting rights and redistricting in this battleground state hanging in the balance. Millions of dollars in advertising have been reserved ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary election \u2013 the first of two rounds that will determine who replaces a retiring conservative justice, potentially shifting the balance on Wisconsin\u2019s seven-judge high court. While the election is nonpartisan, each of the four contenders is squarely in the liberal or conservative camps. \u201cThis seat is crucial to the balance of the court, and the court is crucial to the balance of the state,\u201d said Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of its Elections Research Center. In a state where Democrats control the governor\u2019s office and Republicans hold sway in the legislature, the Wisconsin Supreme Court could become the final arbiter on an array of consequential issues, including the fate of the state\u2019s prohibition on abortion in nearly all cases \u2013 enacted in 1849. The US Supreme Court\u2019s decision last summer ending federal legal protections for the procedure has super-charged the rhetoric \u2013 and spending \u2013 around abortion in the Wisconsin race. Trump's fate in 2024 may rest on whether he can repeat his biggest surprise from 2016 The state Supreme Court could also play a crucial role in the 2024 election. Wisconsin was a key location of former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his 2020 loss, and the refusal of a conservative justice on the state Supreme Court to go along with an effort that year to toss out ballots in two heavily Democratic counties looms large in the rivalry between the two right-leaning candidates in this year\u2019s race. \u201cThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is the most important election in the country this year to set the stage for 2024,\u201d Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, told CNN. The executive director of the Wisconsin GOP, Mark Jefferson, described the contest as one with \u201cevery significant issue of the last generation on the ballot.\u201d Early voting in the primary is already underway, with the final day of balloting Tuesday. The top two finishers will advance to the general election on April 4. Wisconsin is one of 38 states that use some form of elections to select their Supreme Court judges, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. In many cases, those are retention elections in which previously appointed justices run unopposed. Currently, conservatives hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and have voted in recent years to prohibit ballot drop boxes and have selected maps that cemented Republicans\u2019 solid majority in the state legislature. This year, the departure of a conservative justice, Patience Roggensack, gives liberals an opportunity to seize the majority. The side that prevails in the election this spring is expected to control the court through the 2024 presidential election. The candidates hoping to advance to the April general election are liberals Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, and Everett Mitchell, a circuit judge in Dane County; and conservatives Daniel Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, and Jennifer Dorow, a judge perhaps best known for presiding over the trial of a man convicted of killing six and injuring scores more in a 2021 attack on a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Outside money has flooded the race, surpassing candidate spending. As of Thursday afternoon, orders for TV and radio ads focused on the race had hit $7 million, according to advertising tracked by Kantar Media/CMAG for the Brennan Center. Experts say the spending on the race could smash the previous record \u2013 $15.2 million spent on a 2004 Illinois Supreme Court race, according to the Brennan Center \u2013 for the most expensive campaign for a single state Supreme Court seat. If a liberal and conservative emerge as the top two vote-getters Tuesday, this \u201cwill unquestionably be the most expensive (Supreme Court) race in Wisconsin history and quite possibly the most expensive race in the nation,\u201d said Doug Keith, a Brennan Center counsel who works on judiciary issues. Protasiewicz has led the field in fundraising and ad spending, according to the latest data. In a sign of the potency of the abortion issue in the contest, she has run television spots that put her support for abortion rights front and center. Outside groups on both sides of the issue are participating in this race in ways that go beyond their prior involvement in similar elections. \u201cWe just know that the outcome of this race has serious implications for abortion rights in the years to come,\u201d Tiffany Wynn, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, told CNN. Justices on Wisconsin\u2019s high court serve ten-year terms. Activists preparing for 'an absolutely crazy year' in first full statehouse sessions since Supreme Court overturned Roe The US Supreme Court in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision last June overturned the Roe v. Wade precedent that said that the US Constitution protected abortion rights. Since then, state courts have become ground zero in the legal fights over abortions access. \u201cThese races are more important, for obvious reasons, than ever after Dobbs,\u201d said Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for the state affairs team at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which supports anti-abortion candidates. She pointed to a recent ruling by the South Carolina Supreme Court striking down a six-week abortion ban on state constitutional grounds and said that the anti-abortion movement is at risk of \u201cmini-Roe decisions all across the country.\u201d Abortion rights advocates feel bolstered by last year\u2019s midterm elections \u2013 particularly how they played out in Wisconsin, with Democratic incumbents, Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, winning reelection after campaigns highlighting their commitment to abortion rights. Anti-abortion advocates, meanwhile, recognize that their messaging fell short in the fall, and they\u2019re adjusting their strategy for driving like-minded voters to the polls. \u201cWe have a great base, but this far, in the majority of conversations we have had with them, many are not even aware that abortion is going to be the fundamental issue for this race,\u201d Gracie Skogman, political action committee director for the anti-abortion group Wisconsin Right to Life, told CNN.  \u201cThey\u2019re not aware that the fate of our current law rests in the hands of the court, depending on this election. And so that\u2019s the case we\u2019re doing the best to make.\u201d While Protasiewicz has pushed an unabashed abortion rights message in her campaign, the other candidates have found other ways to explicitly or implicitly signal how they\u2019d approach the issue. Like Protasiewicz, Everett has been openly critical of the Dobbs ruling. He told CNN that \u201cyou can criticize that and still say, \u2018I am going to be a judge who looks at the facts, looks at the law, and we go from there.\u2019\u201d The two conservative candidates have vowed to honor the US Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision and have stressed that they would not legislate from the bench \u2013 rhetoric that has been interpreted to mean that they would let the state\u2019s law, enacted before women in the country gained the right to vote, stand. In a statement to CNN, the Kelly campaign singled out Protasiewicz, saying that she sees legal disputes \u201cnot as matters to be resolved according to the law, but as opportunities to enact her personal values.\u201d Protasiewicz defended her upfront approach to abortion, which made her a target of a complaint alleging that she violated a judicial code of conduct that bars judges from committing to how they will vote on issues that may come before them. Her team has cast the complaint as politically motivated. \u201cI really think the electorate deserves to know the values of the people that are running for office,\u201d Protasiewicz told CNN. \u201cWe have this kind of fake, little smokescreen, where certain people think justices should just say that \u2018I\u2019m going to follow the law,\u2019 and that doesn\u2019t tell you very much about the person at all.\u201d Kelly, who is seeking a comeback after losing his high court seat in 2020, has been endorsed by the largest anti-abortion organizations in the state, and he recently picked up the support of the national Susan B. Anthony group. With that endorsement comes a six-figure mail, phone and text message campaign on his behalf. This spring\u2019s Supreme Court race is expected to set the stage for the 2024 election, as the Wisconsin high court is likely to be asked to weigh in on the ground rules for next year\u2019s contest. \u201cEven a tiny shift in voting rules can affect the outcome of a presidential election,\u201d said Wikler, the state Democratic Party chair. \u201cSo, what happens in Wisconsin on April 4 will have a direct impact on who gets sworn into the next term as president of the United States.\u201d Last year, the court\u2019s conservative majority barred the use of most ballot drop boxes and prohibited local election officials from filling in missing information on absentee ballot return envelopes. Republicans see the state\u2019s voter ID law as on the line in the race, with the state GOP\u2019s Jefferson accusing Democrats of trying to use the courts to \u201cstrike down any ballot security measure they can.\u201d With newfound powers, statehouse Democrats race to expand voting rights It is also not lost on those involved in this election that the Wisconsin Supreme Court played a pivotal role in 2020, by rebuffing Trump\u2019s efforts to throw out ballots in Democratic-leaning counties. \u201cBecause Wisconsin sits at the apex of a lot of national conversations \u2013 whether it\u2019s the Senate race or presidential \u2013 I think Wisconsin, at this moment, may end up deciding bigger things like the presidential election, like it did 2020,\u201d Everett, one of the two liberal candidates, told CNN. \u201cI think the implications of that decision that was made in 2020 is the reason why people are paying attention at such a greater detail.\u201d Brian Hagedorn, the right-leaning justice who sided with the liberals in the Trump case \u2013 and who also ruled with the liberals to uphold Covid-19 restrictions \u2013 has been invoked by Kelly as a cudgel against his conservative rival Dorow. Kelly has pointed to his 2020 endorsement of Hagedorn to explain why he won\u2019t commit to endorsing Dorow should she prevail over him Tuesday, implying that she can\u2019t be depended on to rule conservatively from the bench. \u201cI think it\u2019s just terribly presumptuous to say that I have to endorse her blind,\u201d Kelly said of Dorow during a recent appearance on conservative Milwaukee broadcaster Mark Belling\u2019s radio show. \u201cAnd, especially after Brian Hagedorn, I\u2019m just not doing blind endorsements.\u201d Dorow\u2019s campaign did not make her available for an interview for this story. Kelly\u2019s role in advising the state Republican officials in the 2020 election, including as it relates to an alternate elector scheme, has recently come under scrutiny. But he has also expressed skepticism of the legal case Trump brought, and a campaign spokesman told CNN that \u201cthe views of clients are not attributable to their attorneys.\u201d Prominent groups that are backing Kelly tout him as the candidate with a proven record that can be trusted on the right. Among them is a group called Fair Courts America, linked to Republican megadonor and packaging magnate Richard Uihlein. State records show Uihlein donated $1.5 million to the group last month. A recent TV ad lauds Kelly\u2019s 2020 vote on the court to rein in government health orders during the pandemic. In a statement, Fair Courts America spokesman Dan Curry said the group is seeking to make the case that Kelly \u201cis the clear choice \u2026 for those who want a restrained and Constitution-based Supreme Court.\u201d With the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, progressives finally see an opportunity to break up the state\u2019s heavily gerrymandered map, which has allowed Republicans to win some 65% of state legislative seats even in years when Democrats have narrowly won statewide contests. The conservative majority on the state\u2019s high court approved the current legislative lines, drawn by state Republican lawmakers, after the US Supreme Court tossed out another map that would have required the addition of a new majority-Black state Assembly district. North Carolina Supreme Court will rehear redistricting, voter ID cases that GOP had lost A 2019 US Supreme Court case, known as Rucho v. Common Cause, said that the federal judiciary has no role to play in policing partisan gerrymanders \u2013 meaning that state courts are one of the few tools that redistricting reformers have to combat aggressively partisan maps. If a liberal flips the court\u2019s open seat, progressive groups will attempt to relitigate the issue and urge the new majority to strike down the current map, Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, told CNN. Heck and other voter advocates objected to the court\u2019s conservative majority deciding to use maps drawn by Republicans in 2011 as the foundation for the maps it considered following the 2020 census. Protasiewicz, who has called the state\u2019s legislative maps \u201crigged,\u201d has also criticized the conservative justices\u2019 \u201cleast change\u201d approach from the 2011 maps, saying it has \u201cno basis\u201d in state law or the state constitution. \u201cThey made it up to get to a preordained result,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee on Tuesday announced her campaign for US Senate in California, joining a competitive Democratic primary to fill retiring Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s seat. \u201cToday I am proud to announce my candidacy for U.S. Senate. I\u2019ve never backed down from doing what\u2019s right. And I never will. Californians deserve a strong, progressive leader who has delivered real change,\u201d she said in a tweet announcing her campaign. A campaign announcement video highlights her record, including the fact she was the lone vote against the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the war in Afghanistan, as well as more personal aspects of her life such as her decision to have an abortion as a teenager. \u201cWe have to ease the burden on the middle class. We have to find a solution to poverty and homelessness. We have to take on the climate crisis. And we have to stop these MAGA extremists who think they can control people\u2019s bodies and dismantle our democracy,\u201d she says in the video. Lee was first elected to the House in 1998 in a special election and has been reelected 13 times. She\u2019s a member of House Democratic leadership, serving as co-chair of the Democratic Steering Committee, and was the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her time in Congress, Lee has served as the co-chair and whip of the Progressive Caucus. Before coming to Washington, Lee spent several years serving in the California state legislature. If elected, she would be the sole Black female senator serving in the Congress and only the third in US history. Lee joins two other high-profile House Democrats from California who launched their campaigns last month. Fellow progressive Rep. Katie Porter gained prominence among Democrats for her tough questioning in House Oversight Committee hearings and has been endorsed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And Rep. Adam Schiff, the former lead House manager for Donald Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, has the backing of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Other potential candidates in the primary could include San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who formerly served in Congress and was California attorney general. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna has publicly said he\u2019s weighing a decision, but has told CNN that he\u2019d wait to see what Lee decides. Feinstein, the longest-serving female US senator, announced last week that she will not run for reelection in 2024, freeing up the seat in the largest state. Lee had filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission last week, teeing up her entry into the race. This story has been updated with additional background information.

Karamo tweeted Sunday that she was \u201chonored to lead the Michigan Republican Party.\u201d On the heels of the GOP\u2019s midterm losses in Michigan last year, the state party backed Karamo at its Saturday night convention over Matthew DePerno, who had former President Donald Trump\u2019s backing in the race. DePerno ran unsuccessfully for attorney general last year. Trump congratulated Karamo on Truth Social Sunday, calling her a \u201ca powerful and fearless Election Denier, in winning the Chair of the GOP in Michigan.\u201d \u201cIf Republicans (and others!) would speak the truth about the Rigged Presidential Election of 2020, like FoxNews should, but doesn\u2019t, they would be far better off,\u201d he said. Karamo, a former community college professor, rose to prominence in Michigan after the 2020 election when she alleged to have witnessed fraud as a poll challenger during the state\u2019s count of absentee ballots. She has falsely claimed Trump was the true victor in Michigan in 2020 and has spread the conspiracy theory that left-wing anarchists were behind the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump had backed Karamo in the 2022 secretary of state race, which she lost by 14 points to incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson. A CNN review in November 2021 of Karamo\u2019s podcast and writings on her now defunct personal website revealed her declaring herself an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d in 2020 even before the Covid-19 vaccine became a political flashpoint. She opposed teaching evolution and called public schools \u201cgovernment indoctrination camps.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reported last year that Karamo called abortion \u201cchild sacrifice\u201d and a \u201csatanic practice.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb, Sara Murray, Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will soon have new authority over Disney\u2019s iconic Florida theme parks, leeway to transport migrants from anywhere in the country and fewer hurdles to put people behind bars for voting errors \u2013 all top priorities that have animated conservatives who may decide the next Republican nominee for president. And he amassed this power in less than a week. DeSantis possesses a unique asset as he lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign: A subservient state party that is eager to hand victories to the Republican leader. The special session in Florida that ended Friday \u2013 during which his priorities sailed through the GOP-legislature in a matter of days and with minimal resistance \u2013 was a public demonstration of his total control over an ostensibly separate branch of government. It\u2019s a tool he is expected to wield often in the coming months as he eschews an early entrance into the race in favor of building up a record of decisive actions that could be appealing to future primary voters. DeSantis has already laid out several legislative targets when lawmakers meet again next month, including fewer restrictions on firearms, more restrictions on abortion, weaker legal protections for the media industry and more public funding to attend private schools. With Republicans holding a super majority in both the state House and Senate, there is little expectation that DeSantis will not get his way. DeSantis isn\u2019t expected to jump into the race for president until after lawmakers conclude their legislative business in May \u2013 a sign of how important that agenda is to his platform for president and the narrative around his candidacy. \u201cEveryone is just waiting to take their cues from the governor,\u201d one longtime Florida lobbyist said. \u201cHe is setting the agenda and it\u2019s all red meat for 2024 voters.\u201d So far DeSantis isn\u2019t missing out on a crowded nomination battle. Former President Donald Trump remains the only declared candidate, but more appear not far behind. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is expected to announce her campaign on Wednesday. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu formed a new political organization as he inches toward a decision. Others, like former Vice President Mike Pence, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have openly acknowledged their interest in the office. Behind-the-scenes, DeSantis is also readying a political operation for a presidential campaign, with an eye toward making a campaign announcement in late May or early June, two people close to the governor said. His top advisers are in the early stages of launching an organization that could become a super PAC to support his 2024 bid. His memoir \u201cThe Courage to be Free\u201d will drop at the end of February, leading into a national book tour and media blitz. The decision for DeSantis to invite top Republican fundraisers to a retreat and policy conference later this month in Palm Beach \u2013 the former president\u2019s backyard \u2013 is the latest sign of how the governor is ramping up his operation in hopes of sending a signal to donors that he is serious about jumping into the race and he won\u2019t be deterred by Trump. But DeSantis has otherwise dismissed speculation around his political ambitions. Even as he becomes the focus of attacks from the prospective field \u2013 most notably by Trump, but also Sununu and Hogan \u2013 DeSantis has avoided counterattacks that might distract from his focus on stacking legislative wins and culture war victories that his political advisers believe will give him a platform to take to voters, especially in a field full of candidates who are no longer in office. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward for many of us who genuinely like President Trump, but believe Governor DeSantis should be our party\u2019s nominee,\u201d said a major donor who talks often with DeSantis. \u201cTrump can\u2019t beat Biden. We\u2019ve seen that already.\u201d While no president in American history has come from Florida, the prospect of the state having two 2024 GOP candidates \u2013 DeSantis and Trump \u2013 has added another layer of intrigue and questions of loyalty among many Republican donors, strategists and officials. For weeks, Trump has steadily intensified his criticism of DeSantis. For his part, DeSantis has largely ignored the attacks and responded by either declining to attack fellow Republicans or pointing to his 19-point victory in the midterm elections last fall. As the Republican field begins taking shape, DeSantis is sending clear signals to donors and prospective campaign staff that he intends to run. But he feels no urgency or pressure to accelerate his timeline. \u201cI spend my time delivering results for the people of Florida and fighting against Joe Biden,\u201d DeSantis said when asked about recent Trump attacks on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s how I spend my time. I don\u2019t spend my time trying to smear other Republicans.\u201d DeSantis has pushed the limits of his executive authority to hold the spotlight and amass a record tailor-made for a primary battle against Trump. He recently stacked the board of New College, a small liberal arts school, with political allies and like-minded conservatives who have already shaken up the progressive university. Under his watch, transgender children can no longer access certain treatments, and he used his veto powers to eliminate funding for LGBTQ mental health programs. He ousted a twice-elected local prosecutor for simply promising not to use office resources to go after abortion providers. But it\u2019s through the legislature that DeSantis has built the bulk of his political resume, and where he has demonstrated his command of his party. On Monday, DeSantis launched his latest salvo against the financial industry, announcing a proposal to block banks from lending or investing based on environmental, social and governance factors. \u201cWhy is it always someone has to try to jam their agenda down our throats?\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference to unveil his plan to take on so-called \u201cwoke\u201d banks. The special session last week was the sixth time lawmakers were called back to Tallahassee in two and a half years to take on DeSantis\u2019 priorities outside of their regularly scheduled meeting. This time they assembled largely to clean up existing measures taken by DeSantis that earned the governor considerable praise in conservative media but also legal headaches for the state. Lawmakers during the five-day special session voted to give the statewide prosecutor jurisdiction to go after Floridians for violating election and voting crimes. The measure comes after DeSantis initiated a crackdown on voter fraud that resulted in the arrest of 20 individuals accused of voting illegally in 2020. However, the move hit a legal snag in some cases, including in Miami-Dade County, where a judge dismissed a case against a Miami defendant on the grounds that the state prosecutor had acted beyond its authority. Similarly, the Republican controlled-legislature gave DeSantis the power to transport migrants from anywhere in the country after a legal challenge arose when the governor last year sent two planes of migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, despite a state law that the state\u2019s authority was limited to relocating \u201cunauthorized aliens from this state.\u201d The move last week to give DeSantis the power to pick the board members for Disney\u2019s special taxing district was also a step to avoid a potential financial catastrophe after DeSantis last year demanded lawmakers vote to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District without a plan for its existing debt and contracts. Republican lawmakers, though, were happy to oblige. \u201cAs the governor says, there\u2019s a new sheriff in town,\u201d state House Speaker Paul Renner said as lawmakers prepared to hand control of Disney\u2019s special taxing district over to DeSantis. Democrats in Florida, powerless to stop DeSantis and his allies, have mostly used the bully pulpit to criticize their GOP colleagues for ceding so much control to the executive branch. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we just give away this ultimate power to one individual who should live up to the consequences of breaking the law,\u201d said state Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat. \u201cThe reality is that we have a governor who\u2019s setting up a presidential bid. And this is basically his attempt to get earned media time on Fox News.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "After strong electoral results in the midterm elections, Democrats in some key states are moving quickly this year on voting rights \u2013 pushing ambitious plans to expand access to the ballot ahead of the 2024 presidential election. In the presidential swing state of Michigan \u2013 where Democrats have gained the governorship and both legislative chambers for the first time in roughly four decades \u2013 Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and a group of legislators recently announced a package of voting-related priorities. They range from criminalizing the harassment of election workers to carrying out a voter-approved expansion of early voting. Newly empowered Democrats in Minnesota, meanwhile, are advancing a suite of election changes through the legislature that include instituting automatic voter registration and restoring voting rights to people convicted of felonies. And in Arizona \u2013 a battleground state where Democrats flipped key statewide offices \u2013 the new Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes recently announced plans to shift the focus of an \u201celection integrity unit\u201d established by her Republican predecessor from investigating voter fraud to \u201cprotecting voter access\u201d and fighting voter suppression. \u201cNo one thinks it\u2019s going to be easy, but there\u2019s a general feeling in the air that change is possible,\u201d said Lilly Sasse, campaign director of We Choose Us \u2013 a 26-group coalition that\u2019s backing the election package introduced by Democratic lawmakers this month in the Minnesota legislature. Republicans control more state legislative seats across the country, but Democrats defied the political odds in 2022 by not losing any of their legislative majorities. The midterms also saw Democrats gain four new trifectas at the state level, winning the governorship and both legislative chambers in Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota and Michigan. In Michigan, Democrats benefited politically in 2022 from a surge in liberal voter turnout to back a successful ballot measure that enshrined abortion rights in the state Constitution, along with new legislative maps drawn by an independent commission. Democratic state Sen. Jeremy Moss, the newly minted chair of the Senate Elections and Ethics Committee, said Michigan lawmakers now are engaged in a \u201cvery hard reset\u201d after repeated attempts by the Republicans who previously controlled the state legislature to pass new voting restrictions and seek ways to circumvent Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s veto pen. Last year, Whitmer and two other top Democrats in the state \u2013 Benson, the top elections official; and Attorney General Dana Nessel \u2013 defeated a slate of Republican challengers who falsely claimed that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election. (President Joe Biden won the state by more 154,000 votes.) \u201cNow, we have proof on our side of the aisle that Michigan voters want to back away from these falsehoods and lies,\u201d Moss said. And last November, Michigan voters approved a constitutional amendment that eased voting rules in several ways. Among other things, it established nine days of early, in-person voting, mandated ballot drop boxes and required pre-paid postage to return absentee ballots. It also allowed voters to sign a statement affirming their identity if they don\u2019t have photo identification. Democratic priorities during the newly convened legislative session include passing legislation to implement parts of the new constitutional amendment. Other proposals seek to make it a crime to spread election misinformation or to harass and threaten election workers. Moss said he\u2019d like to ban the practice of paying petition-gathers per signature, saying it provides an incentive for fraud. A scandal over fraudulent signatures knocked several Republican candidates off the ballot in Michigan last year. Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, said she will ask the legislature to tap into a projected $9.2 billion budget surplus to provide $100 million to help local jurisdictions to carry out elections. She also is launching a bipartisan elections policy working group to review and suggest election proposals on a rolling basis. It is slated to hold its first meeting Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of urgency and a sense of opportunity,\u201d Benson told CNN. Democrats in Michigan and Minnesota hold narrow majorities in their legislative chambers, leaving little room for any defections in their ranks as they scramble to enact their election priorities in the weeks ahead. In Minnesota, Democratic legislators this month introduced an elections package that includes measures that would automatically register qualified Minnesotans to vote when they get a new driver\u2019s license, give 16-year-olds the option of preregistering to vote and grant the franchise to people convicted of felonies as soon as they are released from prison. Currently, ex-felons in Minnesota must complete all parts of their sentence, including any probation, parole or supervised release before they can register to vote. But Democrats also are moving on a parallel track and advancing some of their priority bills as standalone measures. A separate bill restoring voting rights for ex-felons, for instance, has cleared an election committee and is slated to be considered by a House judiciary panel Thursday. Its sponsor, state Rep. Cedrick Frazier, said he and his fellow Democrats don\u2019t want to squander this opportunity. He\u2019s spoken with lawmakers who served in the legislature a decade ago when Democrats last held a trifecta in state government. \u201cThere is really some regret that we didn\u2019t get this done then,\u201d he said. Roughly 50,000 Minnesotans would have their voting rights restored under the proposal, Frazier said. \u201cWhat we are telling them by not allowing them to participate in the electoral process is that even though they are back in the community \u2018You\u2019re still not whole, \u2018\u201d he said. If successful, Minnesota would join 21 other states that automatically restore the right to vote to some or all ex-felons once they are released from prison, according to a tally by the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks election laws at the state level. In three jurisdictions \u2014 Vermont, Maine and Washington, DC \u2013 convicted felons never lose the franchise, even while incarcerated. In Oregon, another state where Democrats control the governor\u2019s seat and both legislative chambers, a bill introduced this month would grant voting rights to those still in prison. In New York, another Democratic stronghold, the state Senate has swiftly passed an array of election bills this month that allow ballot drop boxes, portable early voting locations and other ways to ease voting. Voting rights activists are watching the action in the states closely \u2013 particularly after Biden and his fellow Democrats failed last year to pass sweeping federal voting rights legislation when their party controlled both chambers of Congress. Republicans now control the US House of Representatives, making the prospect of passage virtually impossible. GOP House members, who cast the elections bill as federal overreach, voted as a bloc against it last year. In the US Senate, Democrats failed to change the chamber\u2019s filibuster rules to advance the measure on a simple majority vote. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been saying: \u2018When you get that power, when you control that trifecta, you\u2019ve got to use it,\u2019\u201d said Cliff Albright, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, who has argued for federal intervention. \u201cHopefully, these states will do what Democrats at the federal level were not able to do.\u201d The moves among Democrats in Minnesota and Michigan follow a raft of voting restrictions enacted in other key states after the 2020 election sparked unfounded claims of a stolen election from Trump and his allies. Last year alone, at least seven states enacted 10 restrictive voting laws, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. And lawmakers continue to propose new laws this year that critics say would make it harder to vote or serve to intimidate voters. In Texas, where the Republican-controlled legislature has passed sweeping voting restrictions, new proposals this year focus on rooting out election crimes and would bestow additional enforcement powers to the state attorney general or new \u201celection marshals.\u201d In Ohio, home to what is expected to be one of the most hotly contested US Senate races of the 2024 cycle, a law signed this month by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, requires photo ID to vote and sets tighter deadlines for requesting and returning mail ballots. Several liberal-leaning groups already have challenged the law in federal court. Veteran progressive strategist David Donnelly said pro-voting groups will remain deeply engaged in \u201cdefensive work\u201d this year, despite electoral gains in places like Michigan. Donnelly is the lead strategist for two organizations, the Pro-Democracy Center and the Pro-Democracy Campaign, that spent $32 million ahead of last year\u2019s midterms on organizing efforts to promote ballot access. Roughly $4 million of that went to groups that were active in Michigan and Minnesota during the midterms \u2013 including a $250,000 grant to Promote the Vote, the organization that backed the successful Michigan constitutional amendment. \u201cIt\u2019s good to shift from being on defense everywhere to being on offense in some places,\u201d Donnelly said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean that the defensive fights aren\u2019t as critical as they were last year.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Sunday marks exactly 50 years since the US Supreme Court granted American women abortion rights with the Roe v. Wade ruling \u2013 and comes about seven months after the court opened the door for much of the country to take them away with Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The court instantly created new fault lines throughout the country when it handed more control of abortion rights back to states. It also may presage a new rift within the GOP. At this moment of greatest triumph for abortion rights opponents, there are real questions about how far lawmakers and potential 2024 presidential candidates will go to prove their opposition to abortion. One potential presidential candidate, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, told Virginians to \u201cchoose life\u201d during his State of the Commonwealth address this month. He\u2019s backing that call up by pushing toward a 15-week ban. Current state law allows for abortion care up to about 26 weeks. It would be a genuine achievement for Youngkin in Virginia, since he shares power at the legislative level in the state with Democrats, who have vowed to scuttle his plan. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week ban into law before the Dobbs decision last year, but given the Republican majority in his state, he\u2019s now being criticized by some conservatives for not going nearly far enough. An aide to another potential GOP presidential candidate, Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, has criticized DeSantis for not endorsing a more forceful restriction on abortion rights. South Dakota has a near-total ban and, asked about DeSantis, Noem told CBS News this week that other Republican governors should do more. \u201cI would nudge every governor to do what they can to back up their pro-life record,\u201d she said. When I asked CNN\u2019s Florida politics expert Steve Contorno how far he expects DeSantis could go to restrict abortion rights, he told me the normally bombastic DeSantis has been sidestepping specifics ever since the Dobbs decision came out. DeSantis released a vague statement promising to \u201cexpand pro-life protections\u201d but has otherwise used an ongoing legal case over the 15-week ban as a shield for discussing what further steps he would take. \u201cPeople on both sides of the abortion debate have told me they expect some kind of legislation will come up that pushes the limit earlier than 15 weeks that could blunt further attacks like the one from Noem, but it\u2019s not clear if DeSantis would support a full ban,\u201d Contorno told me. A ban that goes into effect after fetal cardiac activity is detected could be an alternative, he added, pointing out that DeSantis supported that type of legislation during his first run for governor in 2018. Contorno also pointed out that Florida\u2019s new Senate president, Kathleen Passidomo, told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald she wants a 12-week abortion ban, but that she would include exceptions for rape and incest that are absent from the 15-week ban DeSantis signed into law last year. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump \u2013 who has announced he\u2019s running again in 2024 \u2013 wants more credit from evangelical leaders for delivering the right-wing Supreme Court that is working its way through a total reexamination of US legal precedent and individual rights. \u201cNobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump,\u201d Trump told the conservative journalist David Brody. \u201cI put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and they got something that they\u2019ve been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years.\u201d He alleged \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d among evangelical leaders not appropriately supporting him now. CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes, Gabby Orr and Kaitlan Collins wrote this week about Trump\u2019s frustration with anti-abortion activists for not bringing more voters to the polls last November. On his social media platform, Trump said abortion hardliners cost the GOP votes, especially \u201cthose that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother.\u201d It is the definition of a Trumpian contradiction to both want credit for overturning Roe and be frustrated by the activists who wanted Roe overturned. But it also speaks to this larger issue of how Republicans should proceed on the issue. Opponents of abortion rights want to go further and are plotting a series of new laws in GOP-controlled states. CNN\u2019s Jessica Schneider and Devan Cole note that 22 state governments are under unified GOP control, and as state legislatures come into session for the year, they are looking to further restrict access to abortion services. Read their full report. Republicans in Wyoming, for example, have introduced a bill that calls for a full abortion ban, including on medication abortion, without exceptions for rape or incest, and which includes criminal penalties for anyone who performs abortions. The only exception would be in cases where the life of the mother is at risk. Nebraska Republicans introduced a ban on all abortions after embryonic cardiac activity is detected at about six weeks of gestation. Schneider and Cole note that Democrats are pushing back. Michigan Democrats, who now control the state government, are working to repeal an abortion ban in the state that dates back to 1931 but was on ice during the Roe years and was blocked by a judge in the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs decision. Meanwhile, in Maryland, where Democrats have complete control, voters may see an amendment on their ballot in 2024 that would add abortion rights to the state constitution. CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi talked to anti-abortion rights groups before they gathered Friday for the annual March for Life \u2013 which first occurred in 1974, a year after Roe, and now finds activists focused on passing more restrictive laws in states and trying to rebuild anti-abortion rights momentum after their Supreme Court victory in June. \u201cThe pro-life movement has just experienced a major victory in the fall of Roe v. Wade, but our work to build a culture of life is far from complete,\u201d Jeanne Mancini, the head of March for Life\u2019s Education and Defense Fund, told Stracqualursi. Read her full report. That may not be the case for supporters of abortion rights, many of whom credit the end of Roe with Democrats\u2019 better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterm election. While Republicans will be recalibrating, Democrats will try to carry that momentum built around abortion rights into the presidential election.",

The president and his close-knit inner circle of advisers \u2013 largely the same circle that was tight around him as he prepared to launch his 2020 campaign \u2013 are on public lockdown as they avoid saying anything to avoid tripping any legal issues. But, they still think that \u2013 barring some major and deeply damaging revelation \u2013 this will blow over in time. In interviews with CNN, people around the president talk about the \u201cDC elite\u201d making \u201cDC noise.\u201d They argue that the attention to these documents may prove to be only the latest passing obsession, and that many of the questions they\u2019re facing are from journalists and politicians who aren\u2019t accepting that Biden is \u201chonoring his promise to a T by upholding the rule of law and respecting DOJ\u2019s process,\u201d according to a Biden adviser. By contrast, the adviser said, \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of public record what Americans\u2019 highest priority issues are \u2013 from polling, other research, and the most important poll: the midterms: The economy, cutting costs, fighting inflation, creating jobs, standing up for reproductive rights, fighting for gun reform,\u201d adding that with Biden\u2019s work and record, \u201cthe American people care a hell of a lot about all of that.\u201d Those around Biden with actual information aren\u2019t laying their plans out to nervous donors or members of Congress, whom they know will turn around and talk publicly, and barely care about their complaints over being left out. They mock the political forecasters and the talk of \u201coptics.\u201d They keep private score of four years\u2019 worth of critics whom they feel have fallen flat over and over and dismiss the idea that they\u2019ve gotten so convinced by their own survival mythology that they always underplay whatever arises. \u201cLook back from shortly before the president launched his campaign to now, the accuracy rate of pundits\u2019 negative predictions about him or his strategies is dismal,\u201d said White House spokesman Andrew Bates, stressing that that he and others are taking the investigation seriously, but not the political talk around it. \u201cOur MO, by contrast, has aged well: Tune out the noise, do the work, deliver; and remember that the president knows the American people and they know him.\u201d Asked how anything related to the documents investigations factors into the 2024 political or timing thinking for the people actually doing the thinking about it, Bates said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d Aides mix bitter sarcasm and exhausted jadedness as they mock advice that has come at them so many times before. A White House official cited \u201ca very inexhaustive list of issues that pundits have overstated the political impact of, saying they would either cost us the midterms, doom our agenda, cost us the 2020 election or some combination,\u201d including how Biden couldn\u2019t run a Covid-19-safe 2020 campaign, how he didn\u2019t respond strongly enough to the Supreme Court decision striking down federal abortion rights, and when the midterms were predicted to be a disaster for his party and his agenda. They send around old articles and clips of prognostications about all the times Biden was going to go down. News articles, full of advice from \u201callies\u201d who never talk to the president or anyone who does talk to the president, get passed around in internal West Wing emails and text chains. In part out of deliberate contrast to the daily melodrama that was the Trump White House, but mostly because the small circle of Biden\u2019s closest advisers have all known each other for decades, neither the 2020 campaign nor the first two years of the presidency have had any significant leaks or backstabbing. They are aware they\u2019ve annoyed younger aides \u2013 and even seen some depart \u2013 because everyone in the White House knows there is an impenetrable ceiling for anyone outside of the small circle, who will always have the final word with the president. Even the lawyer representing Biden in the documents matter, Bob Bauer, is the same top lawyer from the campaign and the husband of trusted adviser Anita Dunn. Dunn is coordinating the communications strategy within the West Wing and among leaders on Capitol Hill while Bauer\u2019s putting out the legal statements about what\u2019s been discovered. The people involved often delight in how frustrating their approach is to the contemporary political news cycle in Washington, smiling slyly at complaints and chuckling at people who tell them that they\u2019re boring or complaints about their refusal to engage in questions about the process of how they came to their decisions. \u201cFrom the very beginning when he was running, you could see this resolve and calm consistency \u2013 even when things looked bad, he continued to press on,\u201d said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Delaware Democrat who has known Biden for most of her life and supported him from the beginning of his campaign. Rochester said that the last time she spoke to Biden was when he called to check in at one point during the week-long balloting for House speaker. She didn\u2019t ask him directly if he was running for reelection, but told him, \u201cI\u2019m there if you need me.\u201d \u201cI hear you, kiddo,\u201d she said Biden told her. To anyone who thinks his plans might be thrown off, she said, \u201cI would say, \u2018You might not know Joe Biden.\u2019\u201d No president ever has come in with more years and experience in the nation\u2019s capital, but Biden continues not to do the standard Washington performative apologies in hastily arranged marquee interviews or push aides to take the fall for the sake of feeding a \u201creset\u201d narrative. White House aides see Biden\u2019s nadir so far as August 2021, as just about everyone in the military and political establishment hammered him for how he ended the war in Afghanistan and footage of desperate people falling from the wheels of military planes went viral. They also point out that Biden neither backed down nor listened to the many calls for him to at least fire national security adviser Jake Sullivan. When his legislative agenda fell apart \u2013 and then fell apart more in the fall and winter of 2021 \u2013 Biden never fully gave up on the bills, and he never dismissed White House chief of staff Ron Klain, even as top supporters in Congress like then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed their misgivings. Both Sullivan and Klain are still in their jobs more than a year later. So is Steve Ricchetti, the top adviser to the president who was the vice presidential chief of staff at the end of the Obama administration, when any stray documents should have been accounted for. Ricchetti walked with Biden to Marine One at the end of last week to fly back to Delaware with him, where the president spent the weekend at the house where some of the documents were found. Biden and his aides are treading carefully as the special counsel\u2019s investigation gets started, arguing that \u2013 as frustrating as it is to be saddled with an issue in 2023 because of what may have been sloppiness in 2017 \u2013 the probe will eventually bear out that all the right steps were taken once they found the documents, including when they didn\u2019t immediately disclose what was initially found. Any consideration of the short-term benefits of speaking up is weighed against the longer-term concern of inadvertently interfering or seeming to influence the legal process. \u201cI understand that there\u2019s a tension between protecting and safeguarding the integrity of an ongoing investigation with providing information publicly appropriate with that,\u201d was how Ian Sams, a spokesman for the White House counsel\u2019s office, put it on a call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon. In the meantime, White House senior advisers would rather talk about success in fighting inflation than about the documents. They point to unemployment now at a 50-year low, and the drug price reductions kicking in from the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill which most had given up on until just before it passed last summer. \u201cPresident Biden has taken this matter seriously and shown leadership and respect for the law, which is what you want to see from a president,\u201d said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. \u201cUltimately, everyday people are focused on the issues that impact their daily lives \u2013 cutting costs, adding jobs, and protecting basic freedoms like women\u2019s health and voting rights \u2013 and that\u2019s where the Biden administration has had historic success.\u201d In that way, Cooper added, he hasn\u2019t been surprised by the last week. \u201cPresident Biden has gotten where he is,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cby doing the right thing and keeping his focus on the issues people care about and the solutions that will make a difference.\u201d Based on what is known so far, the situation Biden faces because of these documents is different in many ways from the White House documents found at former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate last year. There is less classified material known to be involved and it was returned voluntarily, rather than withheld in defiance of subpoenas. A Biden 2020 campaign alum embraced that contrast, while also pointing out that for all the attention to the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago, there were no polls showing that to be a major voting issue in the midterms. \u201cRepublicans are effectively defending a guy apprehended in a high-speed chase who then attacked the cops, and they\u2019re going after a guy who self-reported a much less severe situation,\u201d the alum said. Biden\u2019s team is moving forward confident that the president retains an inherent trust with many Americans who aren\u2019t diehard Republicans, and that the combination of that faith and a deliberate, diligent approach will enable him to survive this situation like he\u2019s survived others. \u201cBiden responds to these kind of DC pundit crises with an honesty and perspective that\u2019s more in line with the average American,\u201d said Greg Schultz, who was his campaign manager through most of the early primary efforts in the 2020 race but never joined the White House staff. \u201cPeople like him, they feel that he\u2019s trying to make some things better and they don\u2019t get caught up in the stuff the DC elite do \u2013 and neither does Biden.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrat Josh Shapiro was sworn in on Tuesday as the 48th governor of Pennsylvania at a festive inaugural ceremony in Harrisburg and called his election victory a rejection of \u201cextremism\u201d while declaring his place in history as the \u201cthe next link in the chain of progress.\u201d Surrounded by family, state government leaders, members of Congress and former governors, Shapiro put his hand on three Hebrew Bibles as he took office. One of the holy books came from the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where in 2018 a gunman killed 11 people, including a number of Holocaust survivors, in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. \u201cYou also sent a clear message \u2013 Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2013 when you came together to resoundingly reject extremism here in Pennsylvania,\u201d Shapiro said on a chilly afternoon outside the state capitol. \u201cTogether, hope defeated fear. Unity triumphed over division.\u201d The former state attorney general, Shapiro was elected in a landslide last year, defeating Republican Doug Mastriano, a 2020 election-denying far-right state senator, with more than three million votes \u2013 setting a new record for statewide candidates. He is the third Jewish governor elected in Pennsylvania and widely viewed as a potential future Democratic presidential prospect. Earlier in the day, Shapiro attended the inauguration of Austin Davis, 33, who became the state\u2019s first Black lieutenant governor. In his own remarks, Shapiro celebrated the state\u2019s tradition of progress, but cautioned that its loftier values have often come into conflict with reactionary forces. Shapiro also cast the \u201cpeaceful transition of power\u201d from now former Gov. Tom Wolf to his own administration as further affirmation that American \u201cdemocracy endures.\u201d That democracy, he noted earlier, \u201cis not a given.\u201d \u201cThis work is more important now than ever before, because over the last several years, we have been reminded over the last several years, of the fragility of our democracy,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cHere in Pennsylvania, we didn\u2019t allow the extremists who peddle lies drown out the truth. We showed that our system works, our elections are free and fair, safe and secure.\u201d Pennsylvania in 2020 became one of the key targets of former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to, at first, stop the counting of legitimate votes, and later, with the backing of Republican officials from around the country, an unsuccessful bid to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Earlier this month, Shapiro chose Republican Al Schmidt, a vocal opponent of Trump after that election, to be the state\u2019s top elections official. Schmidt was the lone Republican on Philadelphia\u2019s elections board when Trump and his allies falsely declared a premature victory in Pennsylvania and then sought to prevent officials from completing their count of mail-in ballots. Trump called Schmidt out by name on Twitter, prompting a wave of harassment and threats, but he refused to back down. On January 6, Schmidt was among the 12 individuals honored by Biden with the Presidential Citizens Medal in a recent ceremony marking the second anniversary of Capitol riot. Though Shapiro in his speech did not rehash the specifics of his policy agenda, he sought to deliver a broader, soaring tribute to the idea of a \u201creal freedom\u201d embodied by liberal goals, like abortion rights, access to public education and economic opportunity, and a government \u201cthat respects you for who you are \u2013 no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love or who you pray to or choose not to pray to.\u201d \u201cReal freedom,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere political differences cause debate, but do not give rise to demagogues.\u201d Throughout his speech, Shapiro, who spent the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday volunteering with his family at a Jewish community center in the capital, described his Judaism as both a guide and moral backstop. \u201cMy own faith teaches me that no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it,\u201d Shapiro said, quoting as he did on election night from Pirkei Avot, a Jewish ethical text. He added: \u201cIn this Capitol and throughout our Commonwealth, we have a unique responsibility to keep doing the hard and necessary work to strengthen the democracy that was born here 246 years ago.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the two months since Donald Trump launched his third presidential campaign, potential rivals have been casting doubt over his inevitability as the GOP nominee \u2013 whispering from the sidelines that he has lost his touch, that there are cracks in his base, that his strange absence from the campaign trail will cost him later on. But diminished or not, Trump has still managed to inspire a game of chicken. His most likely competitors want to go toe-to-toe with him eventually \u2013 just not at the outset of their campaigns. While nearly a dozen 2024 campaign operatives and advisers who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity insisted that Trump\u2019s political appeal is more limited than ever, most said they still wouldn\u2019t want their horse to be first in the race after him. Their reasons vary. Some worry about sustainability, wanting to saturate the airwaves just before the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire instead of burning through cash to build name ID while Trump is pummeling them on his Truth Social platform without distraction. Others are hesitant to subject themselves to the concentrated attacks they would no doubt face from the former president and other potential rivals if they were next to jump in, unsure if the earned media in a two-person field would work for or against them. It\u2019s a stark contrast from four years ago. By the end of January 2019, nine Democrats had already announced their 2020 presidential campaigns or exploratory committees, including future Vice President Kamala Harris, underscoring just how sleepy the 2024 cycle has been for Republicans so far. \u201cThe opportunity for anyone to shine is when they are man-to-man with Trump,\u201d veteran GOP strategist Rob Stutzman said. \u201cAny one of these guys can deliver the message that Republicans have been losing a lot lately and that Trump cost us the Senate and the last two elections through his poor judgment. The question is, who wants to go out and be the first to say that?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure that any 2024 prospective or potential candidate is really incentivized to announce early on,\u201d said an adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, who is widely expected to run. Pence courts social conservatives once loyal to Trump Ultimately, the calculations being made by likely 2024 contenders and their allies speak volumes about how they perceive the 45th president as well as each other. And it is all unfolding as Trump, who announced his bid just a week after his party\u2019s underwhelming midterm election, plows ahead, surrounded by minimal staff, who have perplexed allies with some of their recent decisions. That includes failing to stop a dinner he hosted with White supremacist Nick Fuentes around Thanksgiving or his recent broadsides against anti-abortion conservatives. Trump has sought to capitalize on his 11th-hour rescue of Kevin McCarthy, who failed on 14 ballots before finally being elected House speaker after the former president made a fresh round of calls to McCarthy\u2019s detractors. But some allies believe his lack of campaign travel and early missteps have created an opening for alternative candidates. \u201cIf he was still an 800-pound gorilla, I don\u2019t think a lot of these people would ultimately get in, but the change of tune we\u2019re seeing from [Nikki] Haley and others \u2013 they\u2019re not doing that because he\u2019s strong,\u201d said a person close to Trump who spoke with him recently. Haley, a once popular governor of South Carolina during the tea party movement and Trump\u2019s own former United Nations ambassador, has recently moved the goal posts on her willingness to run against her old boss. She told a group of Jewish Republican donors in late November that she would consider a 2024 bid \u201cin a serious way\u201d \u2013 a year and a half after declaring in an April 2021 press conference, \u201cI would not run if President Trump ran.\u201d A second person close to Trump said the former president doesn\u2019t mind being the only declared candidate so far but is ready and eager to take on challengers, especially those who served in his administration or for whom he has played an integral role in their political careers. Of course, no potential rival has drawn Trump\u2019s ire as much as Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who soared to popularity among conservatives after waging war against public health officials and bureaucrats during the coronavirus pandemic and more recently against \u201cwoke\u201d corporations. Trump, who was scrutinized by allies and donors shortly before the midterms for dismissing his home-state governor as \u201cDeSanctimonious\u201d during a campaign stop, has continued to gripe about DeSantis\u2019 unofficial coronation as his heir apparent since announcing his own presidential campaign. \u201cObviously, DeSantis owes a lot of his political capital to Donald Trump, but that\u2019s different than serving in an administration and being a foot soldier for him until the very end, if not beyond that,\u201d said the person who spoke with Trump recently. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said the former president is working to build a campaign that lasts through \u201cthe next 22 months\u201d and will be making announcements in the next few weeks on upcoming political events. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon,\u201d Cheung said. So far, DeSantis has been operating on his own timeline \u2013 a luxury afforded to him after his 19-point reelection victory in November further fortified his position as the leading Trump alternative. The Republican-controlled Florida legislature will begin its next regular session in March, during which DeSantis is expected to push for legislation to expand gun ownership rights, impose new restrictions on abortion access and curb the power of teachers\u2019 unions in his state, according to two sources familiar with his plans. Florida lawmakers are also expected to consider repealing a law that would force DeSantis to resign as governor if he chose to compete in the 2024 presidential primary. \u201cDeSantis has all the time in the world and can use time to his benefit. He can lay out his agenda through the legislative session and continue to build out his fundraising and political apparatus,\u201d said one of the people familiar with his plans. Florida Gov. DeSantis begins second term with spotlight on presidential ambitions As previously reported by CNN, DeSantis is eyeing May or June for a potential campaign launch after the state legislative session is over. His allies believe lesser-known candidates, or those who lack the same level of grassroots enthusiasm the Florida governor has attracted, \u201cwill have to go early, otherwise no one will pay attention to them.\u201d They also believe such moves would temporarily draw Trump\u2019s attention away from the Florida governor. In the coming months, said a person close to DeSantis, the governor is expected to devote more time to his national profile with events outside Florida, though not necessarily in Iowa or New Hampshire. \u201cHe\u2019ll do major events that will draw attention. Not all the cattle calls you can think of, but between now and the beginning of our session, there will be some signature events for him. It won\u2019t be Ron DeSantis in Tallahassee or Miami,\u201d this person said, adding that the governor will begin to \u201cflex his national political muscle more.\u201d Meanwhile, DeSantis has been attracting support from deep-pocket donors, including several who previously contributed to Trump but have pledged privately to choose the Florida governor in a primary, according to people familiar with such discussions. Less than a month after the November midterm election, DeSantis hobnobbed with some of his top donors in Miami to discuss his political future, according to a person briefed on the event. \u201cI think DeSantis has the best chance as things stand today. I\u2019ve known him for quite some time, even before he ran for governor. He\u2019s a very smart and hardworking person,\u201d said Thomas Peterffy, a billionaire GOP donor who has previously supported Trump. One GOP operative who is close to several 2024 hopefuls said DeSantis is \u201cthe only person who really fills the void from an electability standpoint for voters who love Trump but are worried that Democrats will steal the election again, who don\u2019t think he can win or who think it\u2019s time for someone else.\u201d \u201cThe timeline that he has because of this position is long. So if you\u2019re a candidate who believes he is going to run, you really need to make a March or April move so you have time to get your feet planted and stay in the conversation before he enters the picture,\u201d the operative said. Still, sources close to some of DeSantis\u2019 potential 2024 rivals insist they do not envy his position, with several likening him to Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, two early favorites in the 2016 cycle whose fortunes quickly faded. \u201c[DeSantis] occupies this position right now where he is the heir apparent and is presumed to be running, and the more and more these polls come out, he\u2019s going to be considered more and more seriously by the press and with that comes more scrutiny,\u201d the Pence adviser said. Allies of Glenn Youngkin, another popular Republican who is considering a 2024 bid, said the Virginia governor also benefits from being able to take his time with a decision and announcement. A person close to Youngkin said the former Carlyle Group executive could self-fund around $20 million, an amount that would give him a leg up over opponents relying on outside money but is insufficient to keep any candidate afloat from the launch of their campaign through the GOP\u2019s nominating convention in July 2024. Youngkin also potentially has more appeal to moderate Republicans than DeSantis, who has endeared himself to conservatives and Trump\u2019s base with his own brash tactics. The term-limited governor gathered with donors last fall to discuss his future beyond Richmond and has recently said he is \u201chumbled\u201d by the support he\u2019s received for a potential 2024 campaign. \u201cYoungkin, to me, is the guy who comes up through the floorboards later in the process if someone missteps,\u201d said Stutzman, the veteran GOP strategist. \u201cI would be utterly shocked if Glenn Youngkin doesn\u2019t get in this race. He has the least to lose since he cannot run for governor again,\u201d said a person close to Trump. For other prospective candidates, urgency does not appear to be a major factor in their discernment process \u2013 nor, their allies insist, does Trump. Pence, for instance, spent the holidays discussing his political future with his wife, Karen, and their three adult children and their spouses, according to an adviser. The former vice president frequented Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina throughout 2022 and began this year with an appearance at a Dallas megachurch to promote a memoir about his time in office. Before Christmas, Pence huddled with donors in New York to discuss his political future. \u201cDon\u2019t conflate not announcing with sitting back,\u201d said the Pence adviser, who considers \u201cthe end of the first quarter\u201d of 2023 a reasonable deadline for the former vice president to launch a White House bid or punt on the 2024 cycle. Pence\u2019s team insists that if he runs in 2024, he will have reached that decision through prayer, family support and a desire to build on the conservative policy victories he helped implement as vice president. And while the prospect of challenging his former boss in a primary isn\u2019t a huge factor, according to the adviser, Pence and his allies have taken notice of the Trump campaign\u2019s trajectory so far. \u201cIt provides us an opportunity to show the contrast between the two and have that split screen. Donald Trump sends out that tweet about the pro-life movement and Mike Pence is going to host people in his office for the March for Life,\u201d said the adviser, referring to next week\u2019s annual march in Washington by abortion opponents and Trump\u2019s recent criticism of anti-abortion Republicans who wanted the controversial issue to feature prominently in the midterm elections. McCarthy speaker saga shows Trump is far from untouchable ahead of 2024 That sentiment is shared by others who have spent the past year laying the groundwork and watching for cracks in Trump\u2019s support. A person close to Haley said she is still deciding whether to proceed with a presidential bid, something she previously swore not to do if Trump entered the 2024 primary. Her role as a closing surrogate for Republican Senate candidates Mehmet Oz, Herschel Walker, Don Bolduc and Ron Johnson was meant to emphasize her appeal to swing voters and suburban women, though only Johnson, an incumbent, won his contest. Nevertheless, Haley will make the case that she can appeal to the two voting blocs, which the GOP has struggled with in recent elections, if she does decide to run. The former South Carolina governor also believes she has a strong shot at winning the all-important primary in her home state, including against Trump, and has been laying the groundwork there and elsewhere to prepare for a potential campaign. But while her staff is expected to spend significantly more time in South Carolina beginning this month, people familiar with her thinking said Haley doesn\u2019t feel a major rush to enter the 2024 contest. Both Haley and Pence allies said the appetite for candidates other than Trump in early-state and national surveys has emboldened their potential candidates as they look toward 2024. \u201cPeople always think they know exactly how presidential politics will play out. If we\u2019ve learned anything over the past six years, it\u2019s that no one knows anything at this point. The fact that Trump voters are willing to consider a second option means there\u2019s a crack \u2013 and someone will break it open,\u201d said one GOP strategist, who requested anonymity due to the person\u2019s involvement with a possible 2024 campaign. While representatives for Mike Pompeo did not respond to multiple requests for comment, one person close to the former US secretary of state said he is nearing a decision \u2013 and potential announcement \u2013 on 2024 and has been hard at work behind the scenes to build relationships with donors and key Republicans in some of the earliest voting states. Pompeo has previously said he intends to make his next steps known by this spring, though this person said his post-midterm criticism of Trump may foreshadow an earlier announcement. Just days after the November 8 midterm election, Pompeo appeared to take aim at Trump in a tweet: \u201cWe were told we\u2019d get tired of winning. But I\u2019m tired of losing. And so are most Republicans.\u201d The foot-dragging among 2024 hopefuls has seemingly extended to Republicans who lack ties to Trump, unlike the handful of former allies who may or may not challenge him. Several Trump critics, for whom appealing to his base likely wouldn\u2019t matter as much to their long-term strategy, have also expressed an interest in taking their time with an announcement. They include outgoing Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who spent his last day in office earlier this week visiting Iowa for a breakfast with GOP legislators and has said he is currently exploring a presidential campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all the things that are necessary,\u201d Hutchinson told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in the key states. I\u2019m going to be talking about what I believe in, in the future for our country, from border security to energy policy. And we\u2019ll see where that goes and make a decision based upon the level of support.\u201d New Hampshire Gov. Sununu says Trump is 'not the influence he thinks he is' Sununu, meanwhile, recently acknowledged that he is having \u201cconversations\u201d about 2024 after winning reelection in November to a fourth two-year term by more than 15 points. He told Fox News on Wednesday, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna see folks really jump into this race until summer, especially governors.\u201d \u201cAs we hit late in 2023, you\u2019ll see folks decide whether they really want to get in and take this thing on,\u201d Sununu said. In a separate interview Wednesday with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, Sununu offered a glimpse into how he might go after one potential top-tier opponent if they both run. \u201cI think Ron\u2019s a good governor,\u201d he said in reference to DeSantis. \u201cWe agree on a lot, but we have very different styles. We both very much agree that we have to push back on this woke stuff\u2026 I\u2019m more of a conservative principles free market guy, I think, more than Ron is. He\u2019s trying to get some headlines, and he\u2019s doing a good job of it.\u201d While few, if any, prospective candidates seem eager to follow Trump, some sources involved with 2024 candidates said the slow-walk approach could be working against the former president\u2019s future opponents. Whatever broadsides Trump launches against his opponents, it\u2019s unlikely they will carry the same shock value they did during the crowded 2016 GOP primary, when his brash political brand was a novelty. \u201cIt was great TV, and now it\u2019s sort of a worn-out act, and everybody is ready for it. So if you get in first, you get to see what he\u2019s going to do to you, and I think there\u2019s a benefit to that,\u201d said the person close to Trump. \u201cPlus, I think there\u2019s a lot of super PAC money out there for a first-mover, too.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence is making a hard play for social conservatives as he prepares for a potential run for president. And as some evangelical and conservative leaders express disenchantment with Pence\u2019s old running mate, Donald Trump, this reliable bloc of Republican voters may be interested in finding a new champion in 2024. A longtime social conservative and prominent evangelical Christian, Pence is laying the groundwork early to appeal to some of the religious right\u2019s most influential pastors, activists and celebrities. This week, he will appear at First Baptist Church in Dallas for a conversation with its senior pastor, Robert Jeffress \u2013 previously one of Trump\u2019s emissaries to the Christian right. People close to Pence tell CNN the Hoosier Republican is looking to reintroduce himself as a staunch ally and true believer to GOP voters who care about issues like abortion and religious liberty. His work to woo the party\u2019s social conservatives has not gone unnoticed by the movement\u2019s leaders. \u201cI think what Pence is doing is exactly what he should be doing,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, the Iowa-based social conservative activist who runs the Family Leader coalition. The support of social conservatives is up for grabs, activists tell CNN, and while Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis continue to rank high as possible champions, Pence has built up years of goodwill with this part of the party\u2019s base. Further, Trump may be inadvertently helping his former ticket mate by antagonizing social conservatives. His recent comments blaming the party\u2019s midterm election losses on anti-abortion extremism have provided Pence with an opportunity to present himself as a reliable alternative. Pence recently retweeted a statement from the anti-abortion advocacy organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America responding to Trump\u2019s remarks in which the group urged the former president and other potential candidates to articulate an \u201cambitious consensus pro-life position\u201d and avoid an \u201cOstrich Strategy\u201d on abortion. \u201cWell Said!\u201d Pence tweeted. Established social conservative and evangelical leaders say they\u2019re reassured by Pence\u2019s long track record. They say that from his time in the House of Representatives through his tenure as governor of Indiana and later vice president, Pence stood firm on the issues they say matter most \u2013 opposing federal funding for abortion or pushing back on liberal education standards and regulations. \u201cPeople like Mike Pence, they trust Mike Pence. DeSantis may be the hot commodity today, but if he stumbles, they\u2019re going to go to somebody they trust,\u201d said Vander Plaats, a kingmaker in Iowa\u2019s Republican circles. Following his meeting with Jeffress in Dallas on January 15, Pence will return to Texas on January 22 for a similar conversation with another politically active pastor, John Hagee of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio. Hagee, who also founded the group Christians United for Israel, has supported multiple GOP presidential nominees \u2013 including an early endorsement for George W. Bush in 2000. The tour doesn\u2019t stop there. Pence \u2013 who has been promoting his memoir, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d to evangelical audiences \u2013 will continue to visit megachurches and \u201cfamily values\u201d forums across the country. And at this month\u2019s March for Life in Washington, DC, Pence will meet with anti-abortion activists at the offices of his policy group Advancing American Freedom. His efforts come as social conservative leaders say Trump is making a mistake in dismissing their voters, given that their support in 2016 and 2020 for the twice-divorced, formerly pro-choice Republican nominee was transactional and conditional \u2013 the better option, in social conservatives\u2019 mind, than Democrats Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. But for the 2024 primary, the field of acceptable candidates is wide open. \u201cWe had to take a chance on Trump,\u201d said Kristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for Students for Life of America, an anti-abortion organization. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to now. We have options.\u201d But depending on who those options are, it\u2019s unclear if Pence would be the top choice of social and religious conservatives looking for an alternative to Trump. DeSantis is one obvious contender. The Florida governor has emerged in recent years as the party\u2019s most notable culture warrior, including his forceful defense of a law he signed last year prohibiting some public-school instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity. Fresh off his second inauguration, the Republican promised to \u201cenact more family-friendly policies\u201d and may push to further restrict abortions in his state. Other potential Republican presidential candidates, such as Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, have also taken conservative positions on abortion, education and religious liberty. Both Scott and Youngkin headlined SBA Pro-Life America\u2019s annual gala last year. As governor, Youngkin praised the overturning of Roe v. Wade and has called for tighter restrictions on when abortion can be performed in Democratic-leaning Virginia. Beyond the potential competition, Pence will also have to grapple with the break he made on January 6, 2021, with Trump over the former president\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election results. While Pence himself has publicly emphasized their split as a \u201cdisagreement\u201d and continues to tout the accomplishments of the \u201cTrump-Pence administration,\u201d social conservatives say Pence\u2019s most important task is to create a political identity independent of his previous running mate. \u201cI think Mike Pence has to clearly demonstrate his own unique leadership style, and differentiate himself not only from Trump and the Trump administration, but outline the role he played in setting the public policies in the Trump administration,\u201d said Dave Wilson, president of the Palmetto Family Council in South Carolina. \u201cMike Pence spearheaded a lot of the conservative policy directions of the Trump-Pence administration, and he needs to let people know about that.\u201d As in Iowa, South Carolina\u2019s early primary contest may be determined by who social conservatives and religiously motivated voters rally behind. Pence\u2019s first public remarks since leaving the White House were at the Palmetto Family Council\u2019s gala in April 2021, and he has been invited (along with other likely White House hopefuls) to the group\u2019s candidate forum in March. Since 2021, Pence has made eight visits to South Carolina, including two stops there last month. He has made six visits to Iowa in the same time period. Activists say Pence\u2019s maneuvering to win over the GOP\u2019s social conservatives is just the beginning of a long and crowded race to the nomination. \u201cMike Pence has done a great job of starting that conversation,\u201d Wilson said.",

            "article_content": "One of Kevin McCarthy\u2019s first acts as speaker of the House was to take a selfie with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right conspiracy theorist and election denier who has emerged as one of his staunchest allies. That image, which Greene immediately posted on social media, encapsulates the wager McCarthy has placed for the entire House Republican Conference \u2013 and indeed for the GOP overall. To secure the speakership, McCarthy did what his two Republican predecessors in the job, Paul Ryan and John Boehner, would not: grant concessions to the House GOP\u2019s most militant conservative faction that will vastly increase their visibility and leverage in shaping the party\u2019s agenda. With that decision, McCarthy is betting that the GOP can maintain broad enough electoral support to defend its House majority even while moving to center firebrand conservative representatives such as Greene, Jim Jordan and Scott Perry \u2013 all of whom the January 6 committee singled out for their roles in Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Almost universally Democrats believe McCarthy will lose that bet. They believe his concessions to the GOP\u2019s most militant conservatives will compound the problems Republicans faced last November when the party suffered unexpectedly broad losses in swing states and Congressional districts in part because too many voters, especially independents, viewed the party as extreme. \u201cTo win back the Independents they lost in 2022, Republicans should be embracing bipartisanship and compromise, but instead they are doubling down on the extremism that prevented them from achieving a red wave,\u201d says Democratic pollster Matt Hogan. Conservative activists cheering the outcome of the speaker fight insist that a more consistently right-leaning agenda will produce more electoral victories for the GOP by inspiring more conservative voters to the polls \u2013 the way Donald Trump won in 2016. \u201cThe politics of America is turning out a base,\u201d said long-time conservative strategist Kenneth Blackwell, chair of the influential Conservative Action Project. \u201cIt is no longer being decided by 20% of independent voters. So your base matters, your platform matters.\u201d But the disappointing results for the GOP over the past three elections \u2013 particularly in the key swing states likely to decide the presidency next year \u2013 point to the risk that even elevated conservative turnout can be swamped by offsetting mobilization among left of center voters and resistance from swing voters less firmly anchored in either party. \u201cThere was a vote in \u201918 against this ideology and a vote in \u201820 against this ideology and a vote in \u201822 against this ideology,\u201d said Democratic strategist Dan Sena, former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cAnd now McCarthy is just giving them a larger seat at the table.\u201d That larger seat includes a broad array of concessions that will strengthen the right. Among other things, McCarthy has reportedly promised the hold-out conservatives they will receive more representation on key committees (including the pivotal Rules Committee that decides which bills reach the floor); that he will oppose raising the federal debt ceiling without demanding spending cuts; that leadership will not intervene in primaries in \u201csafe\u201d GOP districts to support moderate candidates; that any single member can introduce a resolution to oust the speaker; and that he will establish a special committee to examine the alleged \u201cweaponization\u201d of federal law enforcement against American citizens, which will likely become a forum for airing GOP grievances that the FBI and Justice Department are targeting conservatives. Blackwell led a coalition of conservatives that initially opposed McCarthy\u2019s selection as speaker. But he said the group was surprised and encouraged by how much the hardliners achieved in the negotiations. \u201cWe saw movement in the final analysis, the structure of the new leadership, the ability of policies to be amply considered and dealt with a timely fashion,\u201d Blackwell, also a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the outcome.\u201d To critics in both parties, McCarthy\u2019s acceptance of the right\u2019s demands shows him placing his personal ambition for the speakership over the institutional interests of the GOP in setting a course that can sustain its majority. \u201cNeither Boehner nor Ryan would have made these kinds of concessions,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, a CNN contributor. \u201cIs surrendering your way to victory really winning?\u201d Yet McCarthy\u2019s choices reflect not only his personal calculations, nor even the internal dynamics among members inside the House Republican Conference, but more fundamentally the changing balance of power in the Republican electoral coalition itself in the Trump era. Since Trump\u2019s emergence as the party\u2019s national leader, the GOP has continued to bleed support among well-educated suburban voters \u2013 many of whom traditionally backed the party for economic reasons \u2013 particularly in the swing states that now typically decide the presidency. Instead the GOP has grown more reliant on massive turnout from non-college, non-urban and evangelical Christian voters attracted precisely to the blustery culture war, confrontational and even conspiratorial politics that McCarthy\u2019s conservative critics have now acquired much more leverage to advance. In that sense, McCarthy\u2019s surrender is simply acknowledging in the House rules the shift in influence away from the party establishment toward hardline culture war populists that has been evident in party primaries since the rise of Tea Party, and especially since Trump captured the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of an evolution within the Republican Party and the ascendant wing of the party is demanding a greater say in the way the House majority will govern,\u201d says Ken Spain, a former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Much of what McCarthy conceded to his conservative critics, in fact, reflects significant currents of opinion within the GOP coalition. The committee he will establish to probe alleged \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government reflects widespread suspicions among conservatives: In one national survey released this month, two-thirds of Republicans said they had little or no confidence in the FBI and a majority said they believe it is biased against Trump. Two-thirds or more of Republican voters in polls consistently say they believe the 2020 election was stolen, which suggests they are unlikely to blink at McCarthy offering more power to many of the House GOP\u2019s most virulent election deniers. And for years, most Republican voters in polls have said they want leaders who will fight for their beliefs rather than seek compromise with the other side. In post-election polling Hogan\u2019s firm conducted with a Republican partner for AARP across the 63 most competitive Congressional districts, three-fifths of GOP voters said they wanted leaders who would stand up for their beliefs, while only about one-third said they preferred leaders who emphasized compromise, he said. The problem for the GOP is that in that polling not only did two-thirds of Democrats say they prefer a candidate who stresses compromise, but so did about three-fifths of independents, Hogan said. Most independents join Democrats in rejecting the idea that the 2020 election was stolen as well. And it\u2019s far from clear independent voters will respond to a sweeping investigation of federal law enforcement \u2013 especially one conducted under the right-wing framing that the federal government has been \u201cweaponized\u201d against conservatives. Sena speaks for many in his party when he says the likely GOP assault on federal law enforcement will \u201cgive Democrats the opportunity to be the patriots and the adults in the room.\u201d All of this is unfolding after a midterm in which Republicans faced clear signs of resistance in the electorate\u2019s center. Exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN found that Democrats narrowly carried independents nationwide in House balloting during the midterm. That was extraordinary: the party holding the White House has not won independents in the national House balloting in any midterm election since at least 1982, according to the exit polls. Democrats carried independents even more comfortably in many of the key statewide races, including the governor and Senate races in Arizona and Pennsylvania, the governor races in Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Senate contests in New Hampshire and Georgia, the exit polls found. Democrats ran especially well with female and college-educated independents. One reason for the Democratic success with independents is that they were more likely to describe Republicans than Democrats as extremists. As I wrote last year, \u201cWhile the share of independents who considered Democrats extreme exceeded the share who did not by a narrow four percentage points, the gap for Republicans was 18 points. Nearly two-thirds of independents with college degrees, and exactly three-fifths of female independents, said they viewed the GOP as too extreme, considerably more than in either group that identified Democrats in that way.\u201d Looking across all these results, Hogan said, \u201cIn 2022, Republicans were seriously hurt by an image of being too extreme, especially on abortion and their commitment to democracy.\u201d In the post-election AARP polling, concerns about Republicans on both abortion and democracy, \u201ccompletely erased\u201d the GOP\u2019s big advantage on the economy, which traditionally has been a decisive factor in elections, Hogan said. \u201cWhile Republicans won voters focused on the economy and inflation by over 30 points,\u201d in that polling, he says, \u201cthey lost voters focused on abortion and the threat to democracy by more than 60.\u201d Other results from the national exit poll also show just how much concerns about the GOP\u2019s direction offset discontent over the economy. Typically, in midterm elections, voters who describe the economy as fair or poor break heavily against the party holding the White House. But Democrats performed better than usual with those economically discontented voters. One key reason: in the national House exit poll, over two-fifths of voters who said the economy was in bad shape also said they considered the GOP too extreme \u2013 and the vast majority of those cross-pressured voters ultimately backed Democrats, according to detailed results provided by the CNN polling unit. Similarly, in key races such as the Arizona and Pennsylvania Senate races, and the Michigan governor\u2019s contest, over two-fifths of voters who said the economy was weak also described the GOP nominee as too extreme, the exit poll found. Blackwell, like many movement conservatives, brushed aside any concern that a more purist agenda from the House will limit the GOP\u2019s electoral reach. \u201cAmong the conservative movement organizations\u2026we have refused to be gas lighted into believing that we are a minority party in America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually think that when you look at county commissions, townships, state legislative chambers and the like that we are either equal in size if not superior in number to the opposition party.\u201d But the loss of the House in 2018, Trump\u2019s defeat and the loss of the Senate in 2020, and the disappointing midterm results in 2022 leads other Republicans to the opposite conclusion: that an agenda focused predominantly on energizing conservatives can\u2019t consistently generate national victories. \u201cVoters clearly sent a message to Republicans they don\u2019t like extreme politics: That\u2019s the message,\u201d says Dent. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the message I saw coming out of last week.\u201d For now, McCarthy\u2019s choices have effectively settled this debate: for better or worse, he\u2019s ensured that the party\u2019s right flank will be more influential and visible than ever. That was clear instantly Friday night, not only in McCarthy\u2019s photo with Greene, but also his hat-in-hand nationally televised plea for support to Rep. Matt Gaetz; a few minutes later, McCarthy chose to focus his first interaction with reporters as speaker on effusively thanking Trump. Many of the conference\u2019s most extreme members will be front and center in the combative hearings ahead targeting the FBI, Anthony Fauci, and likely, the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of the January 6 rioters. After McCarthy\u2019s concessions it\u2019s also much more likely that the House later this year will precipitate a government shutdown and a crisis over a possible default on the federal debt that could rattle financial markets worldwide. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that many of the more controversial members within the Republican conference will be elevated,\u201d said Spain. \u201cIt potentially presents a challenge for Republicans in swing districts who will often find themselves at odds with a more conservative or populist policy agenda. it is going to put them in positions to make tougher votes. And votes ultimately become ads in campaigns.\u201d The vast majority of House Republicans represent reliably red districts where the more confrontational and ideological approach McCarthy has set in motion will generate substantial, and probably majority, support. But the party\u2019s control of the House rests on the 18 Republicans who won districts that voted in 2020 for Biden and a roughly equal number in seats that preferred Trump only narrowly, by less than five percentage points. Like Spain, Dent believes McCarthy\u2019s concessions will repeatedly complicate life for the Republicans from more competitive seats. Even more troubling, he says, is that there\u2019s no evidence the hard-liners care that much about what happens to those members. So long as the right can drive an agenda that \u201cplacates their base,\u201d Dent said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they care about whether or not Republicans are in the majority.\u201d It\u2019s an open question whether the steps required to satisfy that conservative base are compatible with Republicans defending their slim House majority, much less winning back the White House in 2024. The deeper problem confronting the party is that the hardliners McCarthy has now empowered may not really mind if the answer is no.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.The new CNN Original Series, \u201cGiuliani: What Happened to America\u2019s Mayor?\u201d airs Sunday, January 15, at 9 and 10 p.m. ET. The evolution of Rudy Giuliani is an epic tale. A celebrated crime fighter who brought down mafia bosses and put Wall Street crooks behind bars, he traded on trust and integrity to prove Republicans could still get elected as mayors of big cities. His empathy and leadership on 9/11 in New York City made him a global figure and a bona fide hero. How that man, who used to get standing ovations whenever he entered a room, morphed into former President Donald Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory lackey peddling lies about the 2020 election is the subject of the new CNN Original Series, \u201cGiuliani: What Happened to America\u2019s Mayor?\u201d The images of Giuliani\u2019s early success paired with his later disgrace are striking and sad. I reached out to one key voice in the series, CNN political analyst John Avlon, who was Giuliani\u2019s chief speech writer during his second term as mayor, including on 9/11, and later worked for Giuliani\u2019s presidential campaign. Excerpts of our conversation about Avlon\u2019s perceptions of the series and what happened to his old boss are below. WOLF: The Giuliani of today is at the fulcrum of so many of Trump\u2019s problems. Giuliani\u2019s dirt digging in Ukraine contributed to the first Trump impeachment. Giuliani helped enable the election denialism that led to the second Trump impeachment. How would you describe his place in Trump\u2019s political history? AVLON: I think that among some hard-core Trump true believers, Rudy will be scapegoated as the source of Trump\u2019s multiple problems. I think that\u2019s an attempt to evade Trump\u2019s responsibility for the chaos he himself caused. But you have got to hand it to him \u2013 Rudy is the first presidential lawyer whose actions contributed to not one, but two impeachments. That\u2019s a special place in American history. And unfortunately, I think this tragic last chapter in his life will overwhelm the very positive, constructive role he played in different chapters of his life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ultimately eclipse 9/11 and his leadership on that day. But he lit his legacy on fire in service of Donald Trump and got nothing in return except disgrace, ignominy, (possible) disbarment and a gutting of his personal fortune. WOLF: I think a lot of people will be surprised to learn about those earlier chapters. He\u2019s this prosecutor who brought down mafia families and insider traders. He\u2019s the mayor who cleaned up the city. How does that guy become the conspiracy theory pusher? AVLON: That\u2019s, to a large extent, what the documentary is about. I think it is important for people to remember he was a leading lawyer of his generation, with an objective record of success in terms of dismantling the mob and taking on Wall Street. That alone would have made him a major figure in contemporary American politics. But then what he did as mayor was absolutely remarkable. George Will called it America\u2019s most successful case of conservative governance. I worked for him in City Hall in his second term as chief speechwriter, and if you just look at the data of what he did, it\u2019s remarkable: He cut murders by 68%, crime by 56%. He turned a $2 billion deficit into a multibillion-dollar surplus. He cut taxes for New Yorkers. He improved the quality of life. I think his policies ushered in an era of resurgence for urban America. In New York City, I think 20 years of Rudy and (Michael) Bloomberg together really helped turn around the city in fundamental ways. The tragedy \u2013 and I use the term advisedly because it\u2019s self-inflicted, but it is tragic \u2013 is that the guy who believed that the law is a search for the truth ended up trying to defend his client in the court of public opinion using the law in pursuit of a lie. I think that he got caught in a right-wing echo chamber ecosystem, where he was totally invested in an alternate reality that was fundamentally hyperpartisan and therefore they couldn\u2019t even conceive of losing fairly. And so at the end of the day, they tried to overturn an election, overturn our democracy on the basis of a pretty self-evident lie with no evidence. I\u2019m not going to try to diagnose how he\u2019s changed. But the filter in the judgment of the man I knew and was proud to work for is fundamentally off. WOLF: The perception is that he has changed as a person, but there are these interesting moments in the documentary that presage the Rudy of today. We see a riot of police officers at City Hall in 1992 that is compared with the riot at the Capitol. In \u201989, he suggested but did not pursue the idea that there had been fraudulent voting. Has he actually changed, or has he just been uncovered? AVLON: Robert Caro has a great line about how power doesn\u2019t corrupt, power reveals. I\u2019m always more inclined to believe the adage that as people grow older, they get more so. There are moments, and the documentary makes a lot of them, to draw a narrative connection between the police riot and January 6th. The person I knew and worked for \u2013 those incidents did not define him on a day-to-day basis. Character counts. One of the things for good or for ill about Rudy, and something that I learned on 9/11, is you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be a hero. Rudy was not one of these politicians who pretended to be perfect. He understood that he was a flawed human being and was actively interested in figuring out his flaws and what motivated him in certain low times. He was someone who thought philosophically about politics. If you talked to him about his position on abortion, for example, he would, in an unpretentious way, start talking about St. Thomas Aquinas, the debate about when life begins. He was also the kind of human who thought about becoming a priest and ended up becoming a prosecutor. But I think there has been a change in his judgment. The Trump orbit tends to attract people who are not at their best in terms of stability. Rudy found attention and relevance at the expense of his legacy and reputation. WOLF: It was instructive for me to revisit just how much of a national hero he was after 9/11. How do you think that specifically affected him? You saw it happen. AVLON: First of all, there is a misperception that\u2019s partly partisan nature that Rudy was deeply unpopular before 9/11. That is statistically not true. That\u2019s not to say he wasn\u2019t controversial and divisive at times. What he would say is that when you\u2019re turning around a ship at sea, you\u2019ve got to throw your shoulder to the wheel. 9/11 was a classic case of the man meeting the moment. The New York Observer, which was often critical of Rudy, said that he distinguished himself almost overnight as New York\u2019s greatest mayor. He became seen as sort of a modern-day Churchill and that was because of his instinctive response to an unprecedented massive attack. And it was also because of his empathy and his honesty. He was able to channel grief in a constructive direction. He was resolute. He said the number of people who died was more than any of us can bear, and he was an inspiration to a fundamentally shaken and horrified world. And it was extraordinary. For months and years afterward, he would be greeted with standing ovations when he walked in the room. I think it\u2019s a little too simple to say that creates a presumption of that kind of reception wherever you go. But I think what it does is highlight how tragic the fall has been. And if he had kept his credibility as sort of a centrist Republican senior statesman who was tough on the issues that a lot of people care about \u2013 law and order, fiscal discipline, etc., including on social issues \u2013 he could have played a major stabilizing force within the Republican Party. He could have been somebody who parks and statues and streets would have been named after across the nation, because of his example of leadership on that day, which was the apotheosis of his career. That was a reflection of the true mettle and character. WOLF: You talked about him being a Republican in a Democratic city. He wasn\u2019t the only big city Republican mayor. Los Angeles had one at the time. Republicans put up John McCain for president in 2008. Mitt Romney tried to be severely conservative, but these days he\u2019s just about as moderate as Republicans get. Do you think Republicans are interested in moving back into that middle ground and governing a big city as opposed to just using it as a foil for their national ambitions? AVLON: It\u2019s a great and important question. If you take the biggest possible step back at America\u2019s historical political divisions, you\u2019ll see that much bigger than Democrat / Republican or liberal / conservative is urban vs. rural. We need urban Republicans and rural Democrats to help bridge divides. When there were progressive Republicans back in the day, particularly in the Northeast, and conservative Democrats, there were a ton of problems. But you could always find governing majorities within divided government. You could cobble together coalition. The decline of urban Republicans and rural Democrats is enormously disruptive for the country in terms of further inflaming hyperpartisanship and polarization and the kind of distrust that already exists culturally kind of in our America. Republicans should care about playing in urban areas, and Democrats should care a hell of a lot more about playing in rural areas in red states. WOLF: We tend to think that it was proximity to Trump that radicalized Rudy, but there\u2019s a riff in the documentary about Giuliani\u2019s visceral reaction to the Barack Obama presidency, similar to how Trump reacted to Obama\u2019s presidency, actually. I wondered how you felt about seeing that portion. AVLON: After his presidential campaign, he becomes more and more sort of isolated in that bubble. That right-wing ecosystem. It\u2019s a form of acculturation where the hyperpartisan environment becomes kind of assumed. It\u2019s the places you\u2019re giving speeches. It\u2019s the television networks you watch. You spend all your time with partisans. It isolates you from the act of responsibility of governing and uniting a very diverse city \u2013 even certainly he had challenges with that. I think that his animus toward Hillary Clinton and the Clintons was one of the things that drove him to embrace Donald Trump late in the (2016) campaign. By the way, he never endorsed (former New Jersey Gov.) Chris Christie or (former Florida Gov.) Jeb Bush, but he really was inclined to support either of them first, because they\u2019re the kind of Republicans that he was. After he made that comment about Obama, I believe it was a fundraiser for (then-Wisconsin Gov.) Scott Walker, he actually called me at home to explain himself. (Read CNN\u2019s report from 2015, when Giuliani said he didn\u2019t think Obama \u201cloves America.\u201d) It was strange, because I think we just had our first son, and Margaret and I met working on his presidential campaign. (Avlon is married to the CNN political commentator and host of PBS\u2019 \u201cFiring Line,\u201d Margaret Hoover). And he called me to, like, explain what he meant. I thought it was revealing of the right-wing media he had been ingesting, and also that somewhere there was a degree of guilt that he felt the need to explain himself to me, who worked for him before, a long time ago.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Marcy Kaptur becomes the longest-serving woman in Congress this week after winning her first competitive race in decades. But she sees her work in Washington as far from over. \u201cI operate in a different way than many of my colleagues simply because of what I have lived,\u201d said the Ohio Democrat, who was the first in her family to graduate from college and represents the kind of Rust Belt community slipping away from her party. \u201cSo why do I stay? It isn\u2019t just to get a title that she stayed the longest. But to use every ounce of strength I have to try to hammer this message: You\u2019re leaving us out. You\u2019re not seeing us.\u201d First elected in 1982, Kaptur became the longest-serving woman in the US House of Representatives in 2018. But now she\u2019s breaking the record of former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a fellow Democrat who retired at the end of 2016 after 40 years in Congress. Throughout that time, Kaptur has urged her party \u2013 especially leadership, which has often been dominated by lawmakers from the coasts \u2013 to wake up to the plight of \u201cindustrial and agricultural America,\u201d not only for the survival of the party, but also for democracy. Meet the history-makers of the 118th Congress In an interview with CNN late last year, Kaptur recalled approaching a \u201cvery high-ranking member of the House\u201d and warning that the federal government needed to invest in the middle of the country. \u201cWe are going to have political unrest. I even used a stronger word. I said even perhaps fascism,\u201d she said. That was before the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Kaptur won a 21st term in November in a district that was redrawn from heavily Democrat to more Republican, defeating an election denier who was at the Capitol on January 6. J.R. Majewski has said he went to protest peacefully and left when \u201cit got ugly,\u201d but the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm eventually cut off spending for him in the district after revelations about him misrepresenting his military record. Kaptur, although she faced criticism from some constituents that she\u2019d been in Washington too long, won by 13 points. \u201cI view myself like the Statue of Freedom on top of the Capitol. It is a woman and she looks east to the rising sun,\u201d said Kaptur, who counts among her proudest achievements the 17-year struggle for the construction of the World War II memorial. It was one of her constituents, a letter carrier from the village of Berkey, who pushed her to introduce legislation for it. Kaptur left a doctorate program at MIT to run for Congress, having already worked for President Jimmy Carter as a domestic policy adviser. She was one of just 24 women in Congress when she arrived. Today there are 149. \u201cSo that is really consequential progress \u2013 in one generation,\u201d Kaptur said of the record number of women serving this year. She wrote a book in 1996 about women in Congress in the 20th century, joking that she\u2019s been too busy to update it. But having more women in Congress is less important to Kaptur than where the women are from and the kinds of communities they represent. A record number of women will serve in the next Congress \u201cAs a woman, let me just say, if you come from the part of America where I do \u2013 and I don\u2019t just mean geographically, but I mean economically \u2013 we still don\u2019t have a majority.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a very rich woman and man in Congress?\u201d asked Kaptur, who lives in the same Toledo house she grew up in. \u201cPeople like us, we\u2019re there. We\u2019re there. We are radishes in a salad. \u2026 But we\u2019re important voices because what we have experienced enlightens the dialogue.\u201d She fought for years to get a spot on the House Appropriations Committee \u2013 eventually going up against Nancy Pelosi. \u201cI was so offended,\u201d Kaptur said, casting it as the \u201cfight of a hardscrabble working-class person\u201d against a former head of the Democratic Party of California. Kaptur has occasionally been at odds with Pelosi in leadership races \u2013 even briefly challenging her for party leader in 2002 \u2013 although the two women have recently praised and supported each other. Kaptur\u2019s voting record on abortion has also evolved to be more in line with the national party. When the Ohio Democrat got to the Appropriations Committee in the early 1990s, she was one of only three women. Democratic then-Rep. Lindy Boggs of Louisiana had to tell her to stand up when addressing the panel. She\u2019s unsuccessfully sought to lead the committee \u2013 losing out to women from more coastal states. But in 2019, she became the first woman to chair the subcommittee on energy and water development and her bill to create the Great Lakes Authority \u2013 a federal regional commission to address environmental and economic issues \u2013 recently passed as part of the omnibus spending package. Still, she said, it can be hard to be heard. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not in leadership, you don\u2019t have a seat at the table \u2013 maybe you have your subcommittee or your committee, something like that \u2013 but it almost is impenetrable,\u201d she said of the institution. \u201cAnd the American people know it. They feel it and that\u2019s why they\u2019re becoming radical in their political expressions.\u201d But she credits President Joe Biden for visiting Lorain, a city in Northeast Ohio, last year. \u201cThat is unheard of. Joe Biden is trying. He\u2019s in a party that can\u2019t see places like Lorain and Cleveland and Toledo.\u201d She laments the defeat of Democrat Tim Ryan, whom she backed in last year\u2019s Ohio Senate race, and blames the national party for long ignoring disaffected voters who ultimately backed the Republican nominee. \u201cSo my struggle is unending. And I hope God gives me the years, maybe I can pound some of this sense into the institution, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d Kaptur said. And then, with a laugh, later added, \u201cI gotta stay as long as Mitch McConnell.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Josh Shapiro had a massive spending advantage and a weak Republican opponent, but the incoming Pennsylvania governor thinks Democrats should still take note of how he made voters see his fight-for-the-little-guy speeches as more than just talk \u2013 and racked up the party\u2019s biggest margin in any swing-state race of 2022. \u201cMy sense is people don\u2019t think government will have the courage to take on the powerful and then be able to deliver,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview with CNN. \u201cSo I think some people are like, \u2018This guy really did take on the big guy, and he really did deliver something.\u2019\u201d What he\u2019s talking about is a wide record of six years as Pennsylvania attorney general. He didn\u2019t just bemoan the opioid crisis but secured $3.25 billion for treatment and other services in the state.  And he wasn\u2019t just complaining about corruption but overseeing the arrests of more than 100 corrupt officials from both parties. In a midterm year in which Democrats lost the House but still did better than expected, Shapiro \u2013 who will be sworn in January 17 \u2013 dominated every day of his race in a state that was key to both Donald Trump\u2019s and Joe Biden\u2019s presidential wins. Former President Barack Obama told Shapiro directly that he\u2019s among the 2022 generation of Democrats who need to have a voice in the future of the party, according to people familiar with the conversation. Famed consultant James Carville called Shapiro\u2019s campaign the best of 2022. He\u2019s already being chattered about by many Democrats as perhaps the future first Jewish president. Democratic gubernatorial winners in swing states have message for national party As Democrats start planning for what\u2019s next \u2013 what they stand for, instead of just what they stand against with Trumpism \u2013 even White House aides who now rave about Biden\u2019s accomplishments being on par with Lyndon Johnson\u2019s acknowledge that they\u2019re still struggling to make many voters see the direct impact on their lives. Happy as they are about how well Democrats did in the midterms, they see most of that as a rejection of Republicans and Trumpism, with top Democrats telling CNN they know they have a different task in front of them as they head into preparations for an expected Biden reelection campaign and efforts to hold the Senate and win back the House in 2024. Pollsters John Anzalone and Matt Hogan said in memo last month that while the party should be \u201cunderstandably encouraged,\u201d Democrats \u201cshould be careful not to interpret the results as evidence that voters liked the party more than pre-election polls suggested.\u201d From MAGA crowds to Bernie Sanders rallies in Pennsylvania and beyond, voters in interviews often express a common feeling that a small group is getting away with what regular Americans never could, and a cynicism that any politician is even trying to do anything to stop them. Put Shapiro\u2019s tight-rimmed glasses and studied Obama-style speaking rhythms next to Democrat John Fetterman\u2019s Carhartt shorts, tattoos and bouncer chin beard and few would see the incoming governor rather than the already iconic Pennsylvania senator-elect as the one with populist appeal. Yet it was Shapiro, who grew up the son of a pediatrician in the Philadelphia suburbs and has been measuring each step on his path to Harrisburg since law school \u2013 and some around him say grade school \u2013 who got more votes in November. Focus groups conducted by Shapiro\u2019s campaign as he was preparing to launch last year had people saying he was \u201cpolished,\u201d according to people familiar with the findings. Worried that could slip to \u201cboring,\u201d or just being written off as a career politician, aides packed his stump speeches full of more references to cases or parts of the $328 million in relief, restitution, penalties and other payments his office says he obtained over six years on the job. When Shapiro talked about climate change, he talked about getting to affordable energy costs and about the fracking companies he sued as attorney general because the pollution was endangering Pennsylvanians\u2019 health. When he talked about student loans, he talked about the $200 million in debt he got canceled by suing a big lender. He was just as likely to bring up the massive investigation his office did into decades of sexual abuse in Catholic dioceses across the state as he was a local construction company from which he recovered $21 million in stolen wages, knowing that either effort would give him credibility and appeal to voters who don\u2019t think much about politics, or rarely think about voting for Democrats. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear you talk,\u201d said a top Shapiro aide. \u201cThey want to see what you can do.\u201d He had a running start heading into his gubernatorial campaign: Since his election as attorney general in 2016, Shapiro and his team had made publicizing the work he was doing a central part of the strategy, from pressuring a huge state insurance company by having news conferences with women who\u2019d been through breast cancer treatment, to mounting campaigns to have supporters write open letter op-eds to CEOs they were after, to setting up a hotline for church abuse victims to call in with their stories. With Republicans all over the country stoking crime fears throughout the midterms, Shapiro would talk about the 8,200 drug dealers he\u2019d locked up in his six years on the job. He\u2019d then immediately follow up, saying that the opiates many of them were selling were part of a crisis \u201cmanufactured by greed\u201d and how he\u2019d also gone after those companies with the power of his office. \u201cLook at his model,\u201d said Rep. Dwight Evans, a Democrat who represents much of Philadelphia. \u201cWhat he says is, people deserve to be safe and feel safe. You got to have a way of showing outcomes. And he does that.\u201d Shapiro\u2019s Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, raised only $7 million, had an account full of QAnon-friendly tweets, was seen in a picture dressed up in a Confederate uniform, held events where men claiming to be security blocked reporters from entering and paid consulting fees to the antisemitic website Gab. But in a swing state that Biden only narrowly won in 2020 \u2013 and had gone to Trump four years earlier \u2013 Shapiro\u2019s eventual victory was far from a guarantee. In reflective moments during the campaign, Shapiro would talk about the \u201cheaviness\u201d he felt while campaigning and about the way his wife would poke him in the chest or voters would grab him by the arm and tell him, \u201cYou have to win.\u201d An observant Jew, whose campaign debated whether to feature a shot of a challah bread in an opening video in which he spoke about getting home every Friday night for dinner with his family (it ultimately did) and who often cited an old Jewish teaching that \u201cno one is required to complete the task, nor are we allowed to refrain from it,\u201d he said he felt the weight both politically and personally. Interactive:\n How 2020 election deniers did in their 2022 midterm races Voters ended up rejecting election-denying Republicans in nearly every competitive midterm race around the country. Shapiro, though, didn\u2019t wax on about the abstract wonders of democracy or voting rights, but detailed the 43 challenges to the 2020 vote count that he defeated in court. He went on offense, mocking Mastriano for talking a \u201cgood game\u201d about freedom, then saying \u201creal freedom\u201d is about freedom of choice in abortion rights, freedom to not have banned books, freedom to not feel targeted by guns on the streets and freedom to have job opportunities. He talked about the events of January 6, 2021, but only to say that Mastriano\u2019s presence in the crowd outside the US Capitol ahead of rioters storming the building showed that he didn\u2019t \u201crespect\u201d Pennsylvanians enough to care what they thought. He never went more than a few words without drawing a direct line back to what he\u2019d already accomplished. Part of Shapiro\u2019s standard routine is always insisting he doesn\u2019t pay attention to national politics and doesn\u2019t think much about what other Democrats beyond Pennsylvania are doing or saying. One of his favorite lines during the campaign was how his focus was on Washington County, just southwest of Pittsburgh, and not Washington, DC. So when asked about other Democrats being wary of going after corporations over fears they\u2019d be tagged as socialists, or about Biden\u2019s only sporadic attacks on oil companies for profiting as gas prices were high, Shapiro pleaded ignorance \u2013 pointedly. \u201cI don\u2019t have a frame of reference,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I guess I am surprised they wouldn\u2019t talk about it as well.\u201d The result for Shapiro: He set a record of winning the most votes ever for a Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate. As his campaign has proudly pointed out, his win was so big that he could have gotten there even without a single vote from Philadelphia and its suburbs: In Erie County, which Biden won by 1 point in 2020, Shapiro won by 21 points; and in Washington County, which Biden lost by 22 points, Shapiro only lost by 2. His coattails helped keep the Senate race tilted to Fetterman even when the candidate was sidelined by a stroke. He also helped his party hold three swing US House seats and narrowly win a majority in the state House of Representatives for the first time in more than a decade. \u201cHe was able to represent everyday consumers against the big guys,\u201d said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, the outgoing chair of the Democratic Governors Association and a former state attorney general himself. \u201cPeople remember that, when you stood up on their behalf.\u201d As attorney general, Shapiro faced the corny political joke: \u201cAG\u201d really stands for \u201caspiring governor.\u201d While many have made the jump, few have done it successfully. Shapiro knows he\u2019s going to have to adjust. \u201cWhen we were in the AG\u2019s office, these cases would come to us,\u201d said the Shapiro aide. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the position of, we drive the agenda.\u201d They\u2019re still trying to sort out what exactly that the shift in mentality will mean. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to accuse me of not doing things,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cI feel a responsibility to now be able to take what I did, that type of approach in the AG\u2019s office and show that government can work.\u201d There\u2019s only so far most Democrats can go in following the Shapiro model. Members of Congress can\u2019t go to grand juries. A president can\u2019t negotiate legal settlements. But with Shapiro and fellow Democratic Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts winning their governor\u2019s races, other Democratic attorneys general are gearing up for more. Even in states with multiple competitive races, every Democratic attorney general was reelected in 2022, except in rapidly reddening Iowa, and the party picked up the office in the key swing state of Arizona. Those and other state AGs are already moving individually and in small groups on more investigations they expect to soon go public in a big way, including more pharmaceutical inquiries, privacy and data protection, and online consumer fraud. Also now rising on the list of targets: cryptocurrency. \u201cIt certainly works. It gets the attention of corporate America. They know they have to contend with us,\u201d said Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who also co-chairs the Democratic Attorneys General Association and just won a second term back home. \u201cAnd the voters appreciate it, and it\u2019s recognized.\u201d",

Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. In one of the best scenes thus far from season four of HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession,\u201d Logan Roy, the conservative media tycoon played by Brian Cox, unexpectedly joins his four adult children in a karaoke bar to try to salvage a business deal that three of them are subverting. He also says he is there to offer them an apology. (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) But when the ensuing conversation doesn\u2019t go his way, he unleashes on them, declaring, \u201cYou are not serious figures. I love you, but you are not serious people.\u201d The line is powerful \u2014 and may just capture the way President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are approaching the declared and expected GOP candidates ahead of the 2024 campaign. For months, it seemed unclear whether Biden would run for reelection. And while he finally confirmed this week that he plans to run, the president said he\u2019s \u201cnot prepared to announce it yet.\u201d Opinion: Don't count DeSantis out yet; the GOP's 2024 race is far from over By choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the \u201cRose Garden strategy\u201d whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and shows voters that he is the responsible figure in the race. The president\u2019s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020: do voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus? Among the GOP candidates, former President Donald Trump was the first to announce his campaign five months ago. But Trump has dominated the media airwaves in recent weeks \u2014 and not for the reasons many Republican voters might be hoping for. The indictment in New York on charges of falsifying business records has raised more questions about his commitment, or lack thereof, to the rule of law. And this legal case is one of many. From a civil suit centering on allegations of rape and defamation to the case in Georgia centering on his effort to overturn the presidential election, Trump might just be claiming the title of presidential candidate in the greatest legal peril \u2014 ever. (Trump has denied wrongdoing in all cases.) Given the way that Trump loves to pit himself against his opponents and use conflict to his advantage, he is embracing his outlaw image rather than trying to move away from it. Recently, he said that he would refuse to drop out, even if he is criminally convicted. Meanwhile, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina are both trying to claim the non-Trump lane as Republicans are watching and waiting for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make his move. Opinion: Sen. Dianne Feinstein's dilemma is a reminder of this universal question While DeSantis has the best chance of challenging Trump in the primaries at this point, he is also fueling the image of a party that is more focused on stoking outrage by taking radical positions in the culture wars than on the big issues of the day. And by recently signing Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban into law, DeSantis, along with so many other Republicans, is taking an extreme position on reproductive rights that could spark a huge electoral backlash. Biden and Harris seem to be betting that in the coming months, the Republicans can do much more damage to themselves than Democrats could ever do by railing against them. Let Republicans be Republicans and show, to borrow Roy\u2019s words, that they are \u201cnot serious people.\u201d Doing so has the potential, in their minds, to create room for a campaign that shows Biden and Harris as the adults in the room. And should the nation be rocked by uncertainty \u2014 whether that comes in the form of rising geopolitical tensions, economic turmoil or a natural disaster \u2014 a majority of voters could choose to back Biden, thinking it\u2019s best not to change ships mid-stream, especially when the other ship looks like it might not be able to sail for very long. While Trump is fighting legal case after legal case, Biden is working on policies such as boosting the sale of electric cars and Harris is strengthening ties with countries across Africa. To be sure, the \u201cRose Garden strategy\u201d has failed before \u2014 Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, a Republican and a Democrat, used this tactic in 1976 and 1980 and both lost their respective reelection campaigns.  But these are different times and this is a different Republican Party. The more the GOP chaos remains front and center, the more independent and moderate voters will be left wondering if the party can be trusted to regain the reins of power in the West Wing. Biden might be boring and fly under the radar much of the time, but that is the image of normality that helped him win in 2020. It\u2019s the image that helped Democrats do unusually well in the 2022 midterm elections, and it\u2019s the image that might very well help him secure a second term in 2024.",

For a while, the fight for the Republican Party\u2019s nomination in 2024 was looking like a two-man race. If you believe the polls, it currently seems like it\u2019s down to one. Former President Donald Trump has inarguably benefited from a rally-round-the-flag effect from his recent indictment. It seems Republican primary voters love few things better than sticking a finger in the eye of the political establishment, and there\u2019s no better way to signal that than telling pollsters they\u2019re planning on supporting Trump in his 2024 reelection bid. But the race for the nomination is far from over. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should force GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward. A third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor. DeSantis offers Republicans most everything they should want \u2014 at least on paper. A politically successful governor who helped turn a purple state red, stood up to what he called \u201cwoke\u201d corporations and passed meaningful legislation to improve the lives of Florida citizens should be the type of candidate that GOP primary voters swoon over. DeSantis takes a risk on Trump DeSantis is also starting to build important connective tissue around his expected run. Without even announcing his candidacy, he has picked up endorsements from conservative stalwart Rep. Chip Roy of Texas and libertarian firebrand Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. In revamping the board of the New College of Florida, he appointed well-connected conservatives such as anti-critical race theory activist Christopher Rufo of the Manhattan Institute and Charles Kesler, editor of the Claremont Review of Books. Recognizing key figures and institutions on the right in this way suggests a DeSantis administration would be serious about delivering on conservative principles. And in addition to high-profile culture war fights, he\u2019s put together a list of legislative accomplishments. He signed an \u201ceducation freedom\u201d program, helping to give parents the opportunity to find the school environment that best fits their child. His efforts to give parents more of a say in their children\u2019s classrooms drew controversy, but he stuck to his guns. Wisconsin sends an undeniable warning to the GOP He also signed laws banning rent control by local governments and offering down payment assistance for police, teachers and military personnel; increased environmental protections and teacher pay; slashed tolls and sales taxes on certain items including diapers; and expanded funding for apprenticeship training programs. And, in a few days, he could solidify his reputation as a governor with impeccable conservative credentials. The \u201cHeartbeat Protection Act,\u201d a ban on abortion in Florida after six weeks\u2019 gestation, would mark a tremendous commitment to the socially conservative wing of the party. Moderates in the GOP may prefer he veto the bill, but DeSantis\u2019 track record would reach new heights if he used his political capital to make meaningful gains in restricting abortion in the Sunshine State. In short, DeSantis offers Republicans a glimpse into what a successful conservative approach to governing could look like. It remains to be seen what sort of national agenda he would put forward to build on his success \u2014 staying open during the pandemic and developing a thriving tourism economy have helped Florida boom \u2014 but this approach is a harder model to export to the critical Rust Belt states. Like any politician, DeSantis isn\u2019t perfect. He fumbled his attempt to navigate the GOP\u2019s hawkish and dovish sides on the war in Ukraine, and even those who like him admit his stage presence lacks the charisma of other, more skilled politicians. And if DeSantis struggles to transition from Florida to the national stage, the likelihood of Trump winning the GOP nomination once again would increase, although it still wouldn\u2019t be a foregone conclusion. The fight against 'woke' is really conservative gaslighting Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, has yet to catch political fire, but another South Carolinian is stockpiling key campaign veterans and making travel plans for Iowa and New Hampshire. Sen. Tim Scott, though not a favorite of ideological true believers, seems intent on taking his optimistic vision for an \u201copportunity agenda\u201d to the voters. Scott\u2019s earnest, if sound-bite heavy, optimism and DeSantis\u2019 dogged, if charmless, record of substantive and political wins would both contrast with a Trump 2024 campaign focused on his personal grievances and political retribution. (Other would-be candidates, such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will likely find the two-step of criticizing the man they once gladly worked for too difficult to pull off convincingly.) While Trump piqued some interest in announcing a focus on chartering \u201cfreedom cities,\u201d flying cars and baby bonuses, the motivating impulse behind his campaign remains what it has always been \u2014 the former real estate developer against his many enemies, real and perceived.  In the wake of the former president\u2019s recent indictment in New York, his campaign has been rewarding donors with T-shirts emblazoned with a mocked-up mug shot of Trump, reminding the world that the central protagonist in a Trump reelection bid would be the former president himself. In his promise of \u201cretribution\u201d and his fixation on the 2020 election, Trump is a known quantity \u2014 one that excites his supporters and turns off moderates. If GOP voters decide their primary operating principle is to enrage the media and \u201cown the libs,\u201d they will nominate Trump. But if the party is serious about delivering on its rhetoric of a more pro-family, pro-worker focus \u2014 and is clear-eyed about the electoral limitations of Trump\u2019s MAGA style and approach \u2014 it will soon have another alternative staring it in the face.",

View more opinion at CNN. In every tale of the Faustian bargain, there is the moment when the devil collects his payment. For former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly, that moment came when he lost the election that would have put him back on the court and preserved a 4-3 conservative majority. Instead, Kelly lost to Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Janet Protasiewicz by over 10% in Tuesday\u2019s election to fill a vacancy on the state\u2019s highest court that will be left by the impending retirement of conservative Justice Patience \u201cPat\u201d Roggensack. By Wisconsin standards, it was a blowout. It\u2019s the first time liberals will have a majority on the state Supreme Court since 2008. On Wednesday, former President Donald Trump offered his explanation for why Kelly lost. \u201cDaniel Kelly of Wisconsin just lost his Supreme Court Election,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cHe bragged that he won\u2019t seek Trump\u2019s Endorsement, so I didn\u2019t give it \u2014 which guaranteed his loss. How foolish is a man that doesn\u2019t seek an Endorsement that would have won him the Election?\u201d Just sign here in blood and you will get everything your heart desires. However, this was Kelly\u2019s second loss since April 2020. Trump failed to mention that Kelly lost his seat on the court three years ago \u2014 with an endorsement from Trump. While Kelly may have tried a different tactic this time around, he has been irrevocably associated with Trump, having advised the Republican Party of Wisconsin on the 2020 election, including the decision to have fake Republican electors meet secretly in the state Capitol to falsely claim Wisconsin voted for Trump. Opinion: Idaho's new abortion law is first to challenge the right to travel Kelly also harshly criticized fellow conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn for occasionally siding with the liberals on the court on issues such as the state\u2019s pandemic response, redistricting and even blocking Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, a 4-3 decision backed by Hagedorn and the three current liberals on the court. Then Kelly toured the state for the Republican Party, speaking on \u201celection integrity\u201d at events closed to the press. If being close to Trump would help a statewide candidate in Wisconsin, Kelly would have easily won. Instead, Protasiewicz used part of her fundraising advantage to attack Kelly for his ties to Trump and the Republican Party. At stake in Tuesday\u2019s election was more than a 10-year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. As Protasiewicz made clear during her campaign, the election was a referendum on the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban and the lines of the legislative districts redrawn after the last census to lock in Republican majorities in the state legislature. Following the Democratic Party playbook since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Protasiewicz hammered Kelly on the airwaves over his endorsements from the state\u2019s pro-life organizations while telling voters that she personally supported a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. The Protasiewicz campaign strategy worked. Her victory continued an electoral trend in Wisconsin, with the continued erosion of support for Republican candidates in the suburban counties surrounding Milwaukee in the age of Trump. Opinion: Expulsion of the 'Tennessee Three' is a chilling echo of Jim Crow If Republicans are going to reverse their fortunes in these suburban counties, they\u2019re going to have to settle the abortion issue. According to the Marquette University Law School poll, the majority of independent voters remains consistently opposed to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe. Those independent voters, especially women, are now pulling the lever for the Democrats. But Republicans are also going to have to end the blood contract with Trump. The trend of Republicans losing suburban votes began before Roe v. Wade was overturned. As recently as 2012, the Republican margins of victory in presidential elections in the three counties to the north and west of Milwaukee County were 40.1% in Washington County, 34.5% in Waukesha County and 30.3% in Ozaukee County, according to Craig Gilbert in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. By 2020, those margins of victory had dropped to 38.1% in Washington County, 20.9% in Waukesha County and just 12% in Ozaukee County. Those three counties, collectively known as the WOW counties, once provided enough votes for Republican statewide candidates to offset the Democrats\u2019 advantage in Milwaukee County. But since the appearance of Trump in 2016, the Republican advantage has been evaporating. Ozaukee County, Milwaukee County\u2019s northern neighbor along the lakefront, is now almost evenly split with Kelly winning just 52% of the vote, down 11% from what the last successful conservative Supreme Court justice received in that county in 2019. Kelly even lost the city of Waukesha (49.7%), my hometown, which the conservative Hagedorn won with 60.6% of the vote in 2019. In 2022, businessman Tim Michels ran for governor after seeking Trump\u2019s endorsement and even agreeing with the former president that the election was stolen. Michels lost by 3.3%.  Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin just managed to squeak out an election victory in 2022 with a 1% margin over a very weak Democratic opponent after attempting to minimize what happened on January 6 and criticizing any investigation of Trump. (Johnson may have been saved by his new position on abortion, calling for limits to be decided in a statewide referendum.) As long as the Trump drama continues and he continues to lead the race for the Republican nomination for president, Wisconsin\u2019s suburban voters will continue to punish the state Republican Party\u2019s candidates with ties to the former president. The Republican Party of Wisconsin may well regret hosting the national convention in 2024 if Trump is the nominee again.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN. It\u2019s time for former President Donald Trump and his associates to face the consequences of creating and perpetuating the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. And it\u2019s time for his supporters to re-enter the reality-based community and see the truth. The findings of a Georgia special grand jury should put to rest any lingering questions about the validity of the 2020 election. The special grand jury was tasked with investigating whether there were \u201cpossible attempts to disrupt the lawful administration of the 2020 presidential elections in the State of Georgia.\u201d They found, unanimously, \u201cthat no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.\u201d And damningly, a majority of the grand jury said that they believe witnesses may have lied to them while under oath \u2014 and that the district attorney should issue indictments where appropriate. The grand jury spent months hearing witness testimony and evaluating the evidence. And it\u2019s worth noting that the public still does not know most of what is in their report, including who they believe should be indicted for perjury, the full list of who testified in front of the grand jury, and whether the grand jury recommended indictments for crimes beyond perjury. This means that the core findings of the special grand jury \u2014 whether Trump and his associates unlawfully interfered with the election in Georgia \u2014 are still hidden from the public. That we\u2019re even reading this much of the grand jury\u2019s report is to the credit of the free press and their demands for accountability and transparency. After a legal back-and-forth over whether the grand jury report should be released to the public \u2014 and after the jurors themselves voted to recommend that the report be published \u2014 a Georgia judge ordered the publication of small sections of the report, including the introduction, conclusion, and a section related to possible witness perjury. The full report, though, remains confidential, with the judge citing due process and fairness. This special grand jury does not have the power to issue indictments; they are an investigatory body, and it\u2019s now up to the Fulton County district attorney to decide whether to present her case before a regular grand jury to decide if defendants should be indicted. Opinion: Nikki Haley is a poor 2024 GOP candidate The information already in the public realm is damning. On Jan. 2, 2021, Trump spoke with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and told him to \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win. He also suggested that Raffensperger could face criminal penalties if he didn\u2019t do Trump\u2019s bidding. \u201cThe ballots are corrupt,\u201d Trump told Raffensperger on their phone call. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to find that they are \u2014 which is totally illegal, it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you\u2019re not reporting it. That\u2019s a criminal, that\u2019s a criminal offense. And you can\u2019t let that happen. That\u2019s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that\u2019s a big risk.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t let it happen and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I\u2019m notifying you that you\u2019re letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\u201d Trump campaign officials and other allies also cooked up a seven-state scheme to create fake groups of Electoral College delegates who would circumvent the real election results and instead cast their votes for Trump. This information is not new. And it would have been far better \u2014 for the sake of transparency \u2014 if the special grand jury report had been released in its entirety to the public. But even these limited public findings are important, as they make clear that an impartial group of average citizens in Georgia \u2014 long a red state, now an increasingly purple one \u2014 will take a look at the evidence before them and conclude, to a one, that Trump\u2019s claim of a stolen election is a big, ugly, dangerous lie. This conclusion seems unlikely to sway any of Trump\u2019s hardcore base, who have proven themselves to be largely unswayable. But it could influence a Republican Party in turmoil, divided over everything from their anti-abortion strategy to who should lead their party\u2019s ticket in 2024. Many Republicans want to move beyond Trump, with his unfiltered bigotry and never-ending drama and posse of hucksters and reprobates. But many of those same Republicans fear the stubborn and loud Trump base. Opinion: The GOP can't ignore the blockbuster report on Trump, Kushner and Saudi funds They should take a page from this special grand jury\u2019s book. It seems highly unlikely that every member of this jury was a liberal Democrat. While Biden won 76.2% of the vote in Fulton County in 2020, there were surely Trump supporters and people who usually vote for Republicans among the jurors. And yet those voters were able to set aside their partisan interests, recognize the weight of the task they were assigned and the power they held, and behave accordingly. They gave the evidence a fair read; they made recommendations that were, hopefully, based on the information before them and not on partisan interests. They weren\u2019t tasked with determining guilt or innocence, but rather with assessing whether the evidence before them supported bringing any criminal charges. They were asked to assess whether it\u2019s possible that a former president and his allies had leveraged an attack on American democracy, or whether that president was telling the truth when he said the election was stolen. They found that, contrary to the former president\u2019s claims, there was no evidence of widespread fraud undermining the results of the election, and that at least some criminal charges should be brought. That\u2019s a much nobler conclusion than the one we\u2019ve seen from members of the GOP, many of whom have largely opposed any efforts to determine responsibility for election-fraud lies, and have instead often doubled down on those lies. Even after the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol shocked the nation and left several dead, Republicans have mostly opposed efforts to determine what exactly happened and how.  If average people selected for a special grand jury can complete this task with honesty and integrity, surely it\u2019s not asking too much for Republican officeholders to approach their roles with similar gravity: To declare that the election was free and fair, and to ask that those who may have broken the law or lied be held accountable. Now, any criminal charges are in the hands of prosecutors. But the future of the Republican Party \u2014 its fealty to democracy, to the country, and to truth itself \u2014 is in the party\u2019s own hands. They can move forward by telling the truth, seeking accountability, and trying to regain some integrity. Or they can move forward with the disgraced former President Trump.",

He is also a former senior policy adviser to Congress\u2019 Joint Economic Committee. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The 1918 influenza outbreak left millions dead in its wake and impacted daily life in ways similar to our own recent coronavirus pandemic. But in popular culture, it vanished largely without a trace nearly as soon it was over. Americans were ready to turn the page on war and pestilence and let loose in the roaring \u201920s. One senses a similar dynamic today. With the pandemic almost officially behind us, January 6 a fading memory and the economy beginning to return to normal, many Americans appear ready for a politics that focuses on new challenges rather than rehashing old battles over mask mandates and election integrity. At its best, President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech offered that forward-looking vision, highlighting his administration\u2019s commitment to rebuilding America\u2019s supply chain and spurring innovation. But no amount of rhetoric could disguise the fact that our political system could be on a collision course to offer up the rematch no one is asking for. It\u2019s still early. But a 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice. New polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump. The dynamics in each party are slightly different \u2013 Democrats are restive but appear to lack anyone in the wings capable of mounting a compelling primary challenge. A new Associated Press-NORC poll found the share of Democrats who want Biden to seek a second term had fallen from 52% last year to 37% now (the poll was fielded before the State of the Union.) Younger Democrats, especially, hunger for a new face \u2013 just under one-quarter of those age 18-44 hope Biden would run again. On the Republican side, some party loyalists have a contender in mind. While Trump benefits from a dedicated base of support and, so far, being the only official candidate in the race, his victory is far from certain. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who, at 44, is closer in age to the former President\u2019s oldest children, has revved up the GOP base with a series of policy wins and culture war battles. Republicans who want to take the battle to \u201cwoke\u201d institutions and push back against the left\u2019s excesses know that the DeSantis model can produce results at the state level. Opinion: Biden plays 'truth or dare' with GOP Other potential challengers, like former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, face an uncertain path to the nomination but also offer a generational shift and a different set of priorities. And many party operatives will admit that a Trump campaign that looks backward \u2013 at the indignities of the pandemic or his false claims about the 2020 election \u2013 will risk coming across as detached from the challenges facing working-class Americans. Both parties face the temptation of playing it safe. Democrats may be tempted to bank on Biden\u2019s ability to speak to working-class Americans to pull out a repeat victory over his predecessor. And Republicans can see polls like the one from the Washington Post and ABC News that suggest that if the election was held today, Trump would likely start with an edge over Biden. And even if a younger candidate tried to push aside a more seasoned candidate, an explicit age-based argument can backfire. Just ask former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro, who learned the hard way that attack lines that seem to focus on an older candidate\u2019s memory or hearing do not play well. Any politician trying to campaign against a more senior opponent would have to be careful about not sounding dismissive toward older Americans\u2019 ability to contribute \u2013 after all, senior citizens are reliable voters. Opinion: Biden's very tough decision But the fact remains \u2013 the incumbent President and his presidential predecessor were alive for the creation of NATO, the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the state of Israel, the first color TV broadcast and other events that all but approximately 5% of Americans only know of from history books. There is a wisdom in age and valuable perspective in having seen the long sweep of history. But both the President and the former President should have the foresight to recognize the desire for a change is not ageism, but a recognition of the demands of the job and the need for new voices and ideas. Both Trump and Biden fulfilled their stated primary objectives as President \u2013Trump, to draw attention to the plight of the \u201cforgotten men and women of our country\u201d and to raise questions about the logic of globalization that turned a blind eye to the rise of China, and Biden, to seek a return to something closer to normalcy after the four chaotic years that preceded him.  But the latent dissatisfaction with either option suggests political rewards for the party willing to take the gamble on a younger nominee. The 2020 primary election for Democrats was singularly focused on choosing the best candidate who could beat Trump. Perhaps Biden may still be the right man for the job. But a presidential debate stage featuring a younger, more energetic politician focused on issues of the moment would draw a stark contrast with one whose habits were formed during the Cold War. Whether that\u2019s a younger Democratic nominee more effectively tapping into discontent over the Dobbs decision\u2019s impact on abortion rights, or a Republican candidate speaking, as a parent of young children, about the need to better protect kids online, a passing of the generational torch will allow for a much-needed shift of focus to fresh challenges.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Sonia Pruitt spent 28 years as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain before retiring and teaching criminal justice. So when she saw the videos of Memphis police officers beating Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old father, skateboarder and avid photographer, her words carried the weight of someone deeply experienced in law enforcement. The officers\u2019 conduct \u201cis revolting in its brutality and disheartening in revealing just how little the needle of police reform has moved in decades,\u201d Pruitt wrote. \u201cPolice body camera and surveillance footage released Friday showed the officers striking Nichols with a baton, kicking him in the head and repeatedly punching him before propping him against a police car\u2026\u201d \u201cThe officers lacked supervision, showed little professional maturity and escalated a situation into what would eventually become a deadly encounter through gross negligence and a complete disregard for human life.\u201d Revamped police training hasn\u2019t prevented the recurrence of brutality we\u2019ve seen in the more than three decades since Los Angeles police officers beat Rodney King in 1991. Nor has the prosecution and conviction of the officers involved in the killing of George Floyd in 2020. It will take federal legislation, Pruitt concluded. \u201cProof of success will come when we never again hear the plaintive cries of a Black man calling for his mother while being brutalized.\u201d Van Jones wrote, \u201cLearning that your child\u2019s life was senselessly stolen from him is every Black parent\u2019s nightmare. But \u2014 surprisingly to many people \u2014 the five officers charged with viciously beating him were also Black.\u201d \u201cHow do we explain Nichols\u2019 horrific killing, allegedly at the hands of police who looked like him?\u201d \u201cOne of the sad facts about anti-Black racism is that Black people ourselves are not immune to its pernicious effects,\u201d Jones noted. \u201cSociety\u2019s message that Black people are inferior, unworthy and dangerous is pervasive. Over many decades, numerous experiments have shown that these ideas can infiltrate Black minds as well as White. Self-hatred is a real thing\u2026\u201d Only four weeks into the new year, America has already experienced 44 mass shootings. Eleven people were killed in a shooting at a Monterey Park, California, dance studio, as the city\u2019s majority-Asian population was celebrating Lunar New Year. It hit close to home for Jeff Yang. \u201cDozens of people in my immediate friend network shared that they were \u2018marked safe,\u2019 detailed how they had been near the dance studio hours or even minutes before the attack or noted that they were connected to people among the wounded or dead,\u201d Yang noted. \u201cThese incidents feel like they\u2019re looming ever nearer, like a specter from a 3D horror movie drifting inexorably toward the camera.\u201d The 72-year-old Asian man suspected of the killings died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that Asian Americans might have, once upon a time, thought that our ethnic communities were insulated from the realities of this country\u2019s spiraling epidemic of gun violence. After all, parts of Asia have among the lowest gun homicide rates in the world,\u201d Yang wrote, citing very low numbers in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.  \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that gun use is very much a part of all three of those cultures since they each require compulsory military service for every able male.\u201d While people were mourning the Monterey Park victims, a gunman in Northern California opened fire at two locations in San Mateo County on Monday, killing seven. A 66-year-old farmworker was charged in what the police called a \u201cworkplace violence incident.\u201d When Winston Churchill served as the minister overseeing the British Royal Navy as First Lord of the Admiralty, he formed a committee in 1915 that would have a major effect on the future of war: its purpose was to explore the potential of \u201clandships\u201d \u2014 armored weapons of war that we know today as tanks. More than a century later, tanks are still viewed as central, and they could possibly be decisive in the outcome of the war between Russia and Ukraine. As David A. Andelman observed, \u201cGoing into the war in Ukraine a year ago, conventional wisdom suggested that tanks had seen the best of their days \u2014 outflanked and vulnerable to drones or fire-and-forget missiles.\u201d \u201cConventional wisdom is clearly wrong. It\u2019s becoming quite apparent that armored dominance on a battlefield like Ukraine could turn the tide, dramatically.\u201d The US, Germany and other European nations announced last week that they are sending tanks to help Ukraine\u2019s war effort as it gears up for a possible Russian offensive in the spring. \u201cThe West needs to get the latest generation of tanks in place quickly,\u201d Andelman wrote. \u201cThe clock is ticking loudly.\u201d There are 21st century weapons in use too. \u201cThe fighting in Ukraine represents the first long-term, sustained conflict where all the currently available uses for drones are an indispensable part of combined operations \u2014 and on both sides,\u201d wrote Keir Giles. \u201cWith the speed at which drone technology is advancing, Western militaries should have decisions in place now for how they are to deal with both the operational and moral challenges of their own or their enemies\u2019 drones being able to kill without human supervision.\u201d The risks of worldwide disaster are growing, in part due to the Ukraine war. So on Tuesday \u201cthe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\u2019 Science and Security Board moved the hands of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight than they\u2019ve ever been. It marks the first change in three years to the Clock\u2019s time; it now stands at 90 seconds to midnight,\u201d wrote former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Sharon Squassoni and Daniel Holz. \u201cNever in the Doomsday Clock\u2019s 76-year history have we been so close to global catastrophe.\u201d Here\u2019s one global change we probably don\u2019t need to worry about: The rotation of the Earth\u2019s core is slowing. \u201cThis is scientifically interesting,\u201d observed physicist Don Lincoln, \u201cbut rather less dramatic than some of the headlines have suggested.\u201d \u201cResearchers have seen this periodic change in the speed of the rotation of the Earth\u2019s core before and they still debate the rate at which it occurs, with some suggesting a 70-year cycle, while others suggest a much faster one.\u201d What\u2019s fascinating is the complexity of the planet\u2019s innards: \u201cThe Earth is not a solid ball,\u201d Lincoln noted. \u201cThere is the innermost core, which is a solid sphere about the same size as the planet Mars. Surrounding that is the outer core, which is liquid rock. The next layer is the mantle, which is sort of taffy-like in consistency. Finally there is the crust, which is the outermost layer \u2014 the place where we live.\u201d The restaurant where Dr. Kevin G. Volpp was dining with friends didn\u2019t have a defibrillator, but when he suddenly collapsed, they started CPR right away. And Cincinnati first responders soon arrived with the equipment and medications to \u201cto jump-start my heart. I was fortunate to be near a major university hospital with highly skilled personnel (the same hospital that initially treated Damar Hamlin),\u201d Volpp wrote. Only 10% of the roughly 1,000 Americans who experience cardiac arrest outside hospitals each day survive, he noted. \u201cSigning up for a CPR course, advocating for greater defibrillator access, training people in telecommunicator CPR use and participating in the CARES registry will improve survival chances for people in your community who experience cardiac arrest.\u201d Amid the controversy over misplaced classified documents \u2014 which started with the discovery of former President Donald Trump\u2019s large cache of papers at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 former presidents and vice presidents are checking their files. One of them, Mike Pence, has already inadvertently thrown a lifeline to President Joe Biden, whose handling of secret documents, like Trump\u2019s, is under investigation by a special counsel. As Julian Zelizer wrote, \u201cBiden, who has struggled for weeks to contain the fallout surrounding the discovery of classified documents at his home and former office, must have sighed with relief when former Vice President Mike Pence announced classified documents were also found at his home in Indiana.\u201d Still, Zelizer added, \u201cBiden, who established himself as the responsible foil to Trump in 2020, has now squandered the political high ground on this issue. And with Pence thrown into the mix, Trump\u2019s team believes the latest developments could help support their argument that this should be treated as an administrative issue, rather than a criminal one. Biden also has more to lose when it comes to the issue of reputation\u2026\u201d For more on politics: Patrick T.

Its parent company Meta \u201cjustified its decision to restore Donald Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts by claiming that the risk to public safety \u2018has sufficiently receded,\u2019\u201d wrote Jessica J.

She is the author of \u201cDollars for Life: The Antiabortion Movement and the Fall of the Republican Establishment\u201d and the forthcoming book, \u201cRoe: The History of a National Obsession.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. Since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June, promising strategies have emerged to protect abortion rights in individual states. Some have begun to pass ballot initiatives to preserve or create state constitutional protection. Others have looked to legislatures to shield doctors and those who help people seeking abortion from potential consequences in conservative states. These wins are hardly a silver bullet: not all states allow ballot initiatives and there are any number of states where majorities of voters seem to support abortion rights but are governed by legislators who want to ban the procedure\u2014a result of deep partisan divides, gerrymandering and limits on access to the vote. Just the same, supporters of abortion rights have made the most of the best strategies available to them, bolstered by the fact that most Americans support at least some access to legal abortion. This is, in part, why antiabortion groups have gotten creative and developed new strategies to cut off access to abortion, even in states where voting majorities have already chosen to guarantee it. An obvious target is abortion pills, which now account for more than half the procedures in the United States. Opinion: What the FDA's moves on abortion pills mean for the future But the latest approach by abortion opponents to disrupt access in blue states is an archaic law: the Comstock Act, passed in 1873 mainly to target what Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader, viewed as dirty books. Comstock, who was made a special agent of the US Postal Service, was obsessed by what he saw as the decaying morals of a country preoccupied with sex. The law he inspired barred not just the mailing of \u201cobscene books\u201d but also birth control and abortion drugs and devices. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Comstock Act was used to prohibit the mailing of many literary classics, from Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s \u201cThe Canterbury Tales\u201d to works by James Joyce and Walt Whitman. Comstock himself proudly carried a gun and scoured the mail for cases involving information about abortion or contraception, even if a doctor provided it. By Comstock\u2019s standard, the law was a great success: he claimed to have destroyed 15 tons of books, arrested more than 4,000 people and driven at least 15 people to suicide. But by the time Comstock died in 1915, Americans were having second thoughts about his crusade and courts started to limit the application of the law. Judges suggested that there were lawful uses of some drugs, like contraceptives, and that the Comstock Act applied only to those who intended to violate the law. That meant that doctors validly prescribing certain medications might be exempt from the Comstock Act, as would patients acting under a physician\u2019s advice. Some members of the antiabortion movement are pushing for a comeback for the Comstock Act, fighting for local ordinances that assert an obligation to follow federal law, including the Comstock Act. The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a socially conservative group, has filed a lawsuit in Texas that hinges on application of Comstock\u2019s law. These groups suggest that the Comstock Act applies far more broadly\u2014to the mailing of any abortion pill, to anyone, anywhere. They question the interpretation of the law offered by courts  since the 1910s\u2014and stress that this interpretation only ever applied to birth control, not abortion drugs. Opinion: On the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I can't stop thinking about how abortion changed my life While the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has already rejected this argument, that seems unlikely to dissuade antiabortion groups. Their hope is surely to bring their arguments about the Comstock Act to conservative judges\u2014and ultimately, to the conservative supermajority of the US Supreme Court. The goal for many leaders of the antiabortion movement in the US is a national ban on abortion\u2014preferably, one that recognizes the personhood of the fetus and establishes that abortion itself is unconstitutional. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s composition, this kind of personhood argument may eventually capture the support of the justices, but likely not anytime soon. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who holds one of the definitive votes in abortion cases, wrote this summer that the Constitution is \u201cneither pro-life nor pro-choice,\u201d and he is unlikely to reverse course in the near term. But if the Court relies on the Comstock Act, the antiabortion movement might be able to secure the equivalent of a ban on all abortion medication without Kavanaugh having to contradict himself. The question before the Supreme Court in a case about the Comstock Act would not likely be a constitutional one. Instead, the justices would have to weigh competing interpretations of the law. Does it apply to the mailing of abortion pills only when there is an intent to violate the law? Or does it bar anyone from ever mailing abortion pills? If the Court says that the Comstock Act bans the mailing of all abortion pills, that would make it difficult for anyone to access them\u2014abortion clinics receive pills from drug companies, as do pharmacies and patients relying on telehealth. In New Mexico, the attorney general asked the state supreme court to block local ordinances that ban abortion and invoke the Comstock Act. This suit could give conservative judges a chance to hold that the Comstock Act is enforceable everywhere, including in blue states. For abortion foes, that\u2019s a key first step in getting their sweeping interpretation of the Comstock Act heard in federal court, with the hope that an appeal makes it to the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative supermajority. If the Supreme Court interprets the Comstock Act to ban the mailing of abortion pills, the Biden administration\u2019s Department of Justice would likely not make enforcement of the act a priority. That would sharpen the already-high stakes of the 2024 election, especially for blue states. A Republican president could take a very different position on enforcing of the Comstock Act, with dire consequences. For those in blue states, this growing focus on the Comstock Act should be a wakeup call. Now is the time to begin working toward the repeal of the law. True, parts of it may violate the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech, and the law\u2019s provisions on contraception obviously contradict Supreme Court rulings protecting birth control. But the law\u2019s provisions on abortion face no obstacles (and the Supreme Court\u2019s willingness to protect birth control is certainly in question if the Court consistently applies the test it laid out in its decision last summer overruling Roe v. Wade).  As it stands, supporters of abortion rights may simply hope that courts will see a strategy predicated on the Comstock Act as a step too far, even for conservative judges. But progressives once had a hard time believing that the Supreme Court would destroy abortion rights. We all know how that story ended. In the next few years, access to abortion may not be a problem only in the states across the South and Midwest that have chosen to ban it. While much remains uncertain, one thing is clear: if Anthony Comstock knew what was happening with his famous law, he would be pleased.",

Read more opinion articles on CNN. This month, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that retail pharmacies will be able to sell the abortion pill mifepristone for the first time. The move \u2014 which will allow pharmacies to request certification to offer the pill and then fill valid prescriptions for it \u2014 is part of the Biden administration\u2019s effort to address the erasure of abortion rights in many areas of the US. As a White House statement put it this summer, the goal is \u201cto identify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible\u201d. Since then, the FDA and the administration as a whole have faced pressure to expand access to abortion medication \u2014 or even contend that state laws criminalizing the pills are preempted by the FDA\u2019s approval of them. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists hailed the FDA\u2019s move to widen access to mifepristone as \u201can important step\u201d in expanding access. And already, two of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have announced that they will seek certification to distribute the pills. But this question must be asked and answered: Will the FDA\u2019s decision to allow pharmacies to dispense the abortion pill make a tangible difference? While the move sends an important signal that the administration is supportive of increasing access to abortion pills, the reality is much more complicated.  A person seeking abortion medication would still require a prescription from a physician in order to access the pills. For some women, especially those in states with complete or nearly complete abortion bans, it will still be illegal to mail abortion pills or to fill prescriptions for them (CVS and Walgreens have noted that they will only keep certification to dispense the pills in states where it\u2019s legally allowed). For the women who need it most, the rule change does little. Some major pharmacies are planning to dispense abortion pills, but not in every state So, the FDA\u2019s announcement may not be as transformational as the Biden administration would have us think, but it does deliver a potent reminder of the stakes of the 2024 election: Who sits in the White House may, in part, decide the fate of abortion pills. While it\u2019s true that the White House may not be able to ensure abortion access in states with criminal bans, a Republican president just might be able to make sure that abortion pills are unavailable in places where abortion is legal \u2014 or even a protected right. The abortion issue seems to have been costly for Republicans during the midterm, and it may make sense for them to proceed cautiously, even after 2024. Within the GOP, many, including former President Donald Trump, have blamed the Republican stance on abortion for the GOP\u2019s poor showing in the midterm. When majority leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana unveiled House Republicans\u2019 priorities, his proposals on abortion were strikingly unambitious. And some anti-abortion groups are promoting more elaborate proposals, such as an executive order recognizing fetal personhood, but a Republican president might not need to go that far. One reason for that is the Comstock Act, a federal obscenity law passed in the 19th century. Part of the Comstock Act, which was once best known for suppressing literature, sex education materials and even anatomy texts deemed to be obscene, seems to make it illegal to send via mail \u201c[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.\u201d Under Biden, the Department of Justice recently released a definitive memo suggesting that mailing abortion pills is perfectly legal unless it is done with the intent of violating the law. But in a Republican administration, the DOJ could interpret the Comstock Act to apply to the mailing of every abortion pill and decide to aggressively enforce the law against those thought to violate it. Despite the current DOJ\u2019s interpretation of the law, anti-abortion groups are supporting local laws and bringing lawsuits suggesting that abortion pills are functionally illegal nationwide because of the Comstock Act. And neither telehealth nor in-clinic medication abortions would be possible if pills could not be mailed. How a medication abortion, also known as an 'abortion pill,' works For the moment, this argument is doomed, but anti-abortion activists might not care. Their argument could succeed before a Supreme Court already transformed by one Republican president. Or a Republican DOJ in a future administration could change course. Control of the FDA can be as much of a gamechanger as power over the DOJ.   This has been true since the early days of abortion drugs\u2019 approval in the United States, and the FDA now returns to center stage as more women and providers need access to medication abortions. Meanwhile, anti-choice groups are getting creative in approaching the agency. Students for Life, a major anti-abortion group, has a petition before the FDA asking the agency to require any doctor prescribing abortion pills to be responsible for fetal remains \u2014 and to bag them and treat them as medical waste. If Students for Life won, the new FDA rule could create insurmountable obstacles for abortion providers, who would have to monitor and dispose of medical waste in every procedure, including those done through telehealth. The Alliance Defending Freedom, another major player in the anti-abortion movement, already went to court to ask federal judges to declare that the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved abortion pills. Even a long shot may seem worth a try with the current ultraconservative Supreme Court, and besides, with a Republican in the White House, the FDA may change radically.  In 2020, a group of Republicans, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, sent a letter to the FDA asking that abortion pills be pulled from the market. With a Republican in the White House, they just might get their wish. So, the latest FDA announcement may be much ado about relatively little. As far as access to abortion pills is concerned, this move must be contextualized withing the web of legal action, both at the state and federal level, which will continue to determine who can access abortion resources and who cannot. But in a different administration, both the DOJ and FDA might target abortion pills, and that means your vote for who sits in the White House matters more than you think.",

According to the Pentagon, about half of the reports have been preliminarily identified as \u201cballoons or balloon-entities,\u201d while a handful of others have been attributed to drones, birds, weather events, or debris like plastic bags. The remaining 171 reported UFO sightings, on the other hand, continue to be unexplained by the US government. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Powerful storms are moving across the US, leaving widespread damage and wreaking havoc on millions of people. In the South, a severe weather outbreak reportedly spawned at least 35 tornadoes on Thursday, sending residents running for cover from the fierce winds, officials said. At least seven people, including a child, were killed in Alabama and Georgia, and search efforts are set to continue today. Meanwhile, floods in California have left a trail of destruction in the state \u2013 and an additional lineup of storms will likely create another difficult weekend. Millions of people will be under flood watches, with at least three storm systems expected to impact several regions across the state. Some areas that are already drenched are bracing for at least five inches of rain or more, forecasts show. President Joe Biden is now facing a special counsel investigation after Obama-era classified files were found at his private office in Washington and his home in Delaware. The discoveries have launched a bevy of Republican congressional inquiries now that the GOP has control over the House of Representatives. On Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to take over the investigation. The special counsel is former Maryland US attorney Robert Hur, who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump in 2017 and recently worked in private practice. Biden told reporters he was cooperating fully with the DOJ and the White House said it\u2019s confident the probe will show documents were \u201cinadvertently misplaced.\u201d Tax filing season will begin on January 23, the IRS announced on Thursday, but there are still several months to get your documents in order. The official due date for returns this year is April 18, the agency said. After you file, the IRS said it is likely to deliver your refund within 21 days of receiving your return \u2013 its typical turnaround time \u2013 but only if you fill out your return accurately and completely, file it electronically and opt to have your refund delivered through direct deposit. The agency advises against filing paper returns, if possible. And for those who might be dreading this task, it may help to know that the majority of tax filers every year are typically owed a refund. Last year, the average refund issued was $3,176. Food prices in the US remain stubbornly high but are seeing some easing. In December, \u201cfood at home\u201d prices increased 0.2% from the month before, according to data released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s the smallest monthly increase since March 2021. Among the foods with the highest increase in prices are eggs; up 59.9% annually, butter; up 35.3% annually, and lettuce; up 24.9% annually. As for the broader picture of inflation, consumer prices decreased by 0.1% in December, the BLS reported in its Consumer Price Index report. This marked the first inflation report of the new year \u2013 and the last before the Federal Reserve meets at the end of the month to determine how aggressively it will tackle rising costs. Lisa Marie Presley, the only daughter of the late Elvis Presley, died Thursday after suffering an apparent cardiac arrest. She was 54. \u201cPriscilla Presley and the Presley family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Lisa Marie,\u201d said a statement from the family provided to CNN. \u201cThey are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d The singer spent her life in the spotlight from the start, after being born at the height of Elvis\u2019s fame in 1968. Parallel to her musical pursuits, Lisa Marie Presley was a mother of four and was married four times, including to music superstar Michael Jackson and actor Nicolas Cage. Tributes have been pouring in to honor her life and legacy. Trump Org. to be sentenced today after conviction for tax schemes Two Trump Organization entities will be sentenced by a New York judge today for running a decade-long tax fraud scheme. The two entities, The Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp., were convicted last month of 17 felonies, including tax fraud and falsifying business records. Under New York law, the most the companies can be fined is about $1.6 million, a penalty the Trump Organization can easily afford. Accordingly, the sentencing will be more of a symbolic moment, as it is the only judgment for a criminal conviction that has come close to former President Donald Trump.

In April 2021, Yao Pan Ma was collecting cans when he was approached from behind on an East Harlem corner, struck in the back and kicked in the head multiple times, according to police. Ma, who was Chinese-American, died from his injuries eight months later. The attack came amid a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans that prompted the New York Police Department to deploy undercover Asian officers on the streets in an attempt to stem the violence. \u201cThe US must not provide shelter for him, or any authoritarian who has inspired such violence against democratic institutions.\u201d \u2013 Dozens of House Democrats, urging President Biden not to \u201cprovide shelter\u201d for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in the wake of an attack on Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions. In a letter to Biden, the lawmakers on Thursday called for the administration to reassess Bolsonaro\u2019s status in the US and revoke his visa if necessary. Bolsonaro, who departed Brazil shortly before the January 1 inauguration of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has been residing in Florida. Experts say his repeated and unfounded claims of election fraud in the run-up to Brazil\u2019s presidential election inspired his supporters to storm the capital Brasilia and trash government offices.

            "article_content": "The Kennedys have been through a lot. They don\u2019t want to go through this. No name has appeared on more ballots or lawn signs. Even across branches of the family that have grown distant and divided since the first generation rose to power in the 1960s, they celebrate each cousin\u2019s achievement \u2013 whether that\u2019s a seat in the House or a new children\u2019s book or an expansion of the Special Olympics. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s campaign challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination \u2013 set to be announced Wednesday in Boston \u2013 is too much for a family that defined the modern Democratic Party. They\u2019re frustrated, sad and completely opposed. They say they love him. They use words like \u201cheartbroken\u201d and \u201ctragic.\u201d It\u2019s the vaccine skepticism, which includes a book about \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d and saying Anne Frank was better off than Americans under supposed vaccine mandates because she could at least hide from the Nazis. It\u2019s insisting that Sirhan Sirhan didn\u2019t actually shoot Kennedy\u2019s father, and breaking with many in the family years ago to argue for the assassin\u2019s parole. Now, it\u2019s going up against a president whose administration is stocked with Kennedys in prominent positions and who has decades of personal and emotional connections to multiple members of the family. They see the very namesake of one of the original brothers trying to leverage the most storied family legacy in Democratic politics, for what many of them have been saying privately is a vanity run that is doomed. And that they want to be doomed. \u201cThey\u2019re angry to be put in this position \u2013 because they always want to support the family, but they\u2019re being put in a position that makes that impossible,\u201d said one person who has spoken to several members of a family generally so guarded that even longtime aides often feel like they barely understand the dynamics themselves. \u201cWhich brother?\u201d Chris Kennedy, a former gubernatorial candidate in Illinois, joked when asked by CNN about his thoughts on his brother\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis is a difficult situation for me. I love my older brother Bobby. He has extraordinary charisma and is a very gifted speaker,\u201d Rory Kennedy, the filmmaker and youngest child of Robert F. Kennedy, told CNN. \u201cI admire his past work as an environmentalist \u2013 because of him, we can swim in the Hudson. But due to a wide range of Bobby\u2019s positions, I\u2019m supporting President Biden.\u201d \u201cI prefer not to talk,\u201d texted Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor who\u2019s now an adviser on retirement at the Labor Department, when asked about the frustration within the family about her brother\u2019s run. Kennedy Townsend\u2019s assessment is clear, though: She co-authored a 2019 article with her brother former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and her late daughter bemoaning that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u201chelped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.\u201d Among her many pro-Biden tweets, meanwhile, is one a few weeks ago with a picture of the president walking in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr  Zelensky calling them, with a JFK nod, \u201cTwo Profiles in Courage.\u201d Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged his family\u2019s \u201cclose personal friendship\u201d with Biden in a statement to CNN in which called out Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Ukraine as of one of \u201cthe bad decisions\u201d he disagrees with: \u201cIt has been my difficult choice to put my principles ahead of my personal affections for the President which remain undiminished. Some members of my family agree with me and others do not. I bear them no ill will. Families can disagree and still love each other. We hold that possibility for the entire country too.\u201d But he\u2019s leaning hard into his family connections from the start: He\u2019s launching the campaign in Boston \u2013 a city where he never lived but that is closely associated with his family \u2013 in a hotel where his uncle, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, often appeared. He devoted three of the six sentences in the news release about his candidacy to the fact that he \u201chails from one of the most famous families in American political history\u201d and the winking, semi-accurate statement that his father \u201cmounted a major campaign in a tumultuous primary that dislodged the incumbent Democratic President Lyndon Johnson.\u201d Promoting the announcement, he tweeted a photo of himself wearing a T-shirt with the image of a 1960s \u201cKENNEDY FOR PRESIDENT\u201d campaign button. Kerry Kennedy, another sister and the president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, drew a larger distinction between the family and the campaign. \u201cI love my brother Bobby,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the COVID pandemic, vaccinations, and the role of social media platforms in policing false information. It is also important to note that Bobby\u2019s views are not reflected in or influence the mission or work of our organization.\u201d Her cousin Bobby Shriver, the former mayor of Santa Monica, California, and a co-founder of the (RED) corporate anti-AIDS campaign, subtweeted the news Kennedy filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission earlier this month: \u201cA good day to say I was thrilled to be an early support[er] of Joe Biden in 2015? Excited to work hard again!\u201d Patrick Kennedy, the former Rhode Island congressman who\u2019s the son of Ted Kennedy, the younger cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and an advocate for mental health and addiction issues, told CNN his feelings on the campaign are clear: \u201cI support President Biden.\u201d Among other reasons, he said, that\u2019s because Biden has done \u201cmore than any other president\u201d to enforce a bill that prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against people with mental illnesses or addictions and because of his broader support for efforts to reform the mental health and substance use disorder system. For many Kennedys, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. taps into a deeper existential fear for the family. The Americans who revered the original brothers are well into retirement age and starting to die. Even the memories of the next generations\u2019 tabloid dramas and curse-like tragedies have begun to fade. They worry that the real effect of this presidential campaign may not be taking many delegates from Biden but making people think that what he stands for is what the family\u2019s all about. \u201cPresident Kennedy signed the original Community Mental Health Act of \u201963. Attorney General Robert Kennedy created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in order to intervene early in young people\u2019s lives, and my father was primary Senate sponsor of parity,\u201d said Patrick Kennedy. \u201cThese issues, and the incredible legacy that they all had on civil rights \u2013 from JFK being the first president to address the issue on national TV to RFK standing with Dr. King to my father\u2019s seminal work on the Voting Rights Act \u2013 and immigration reform, are at the heart of my family\u2019s legacy.\u201d Biden has been quoting one of the less famous lines from John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1961 moonshot speech since his first doomed run for president in 1987. He usually says it as, \u201cWe refuse to postpone,\u201d though the actual quote Kennedy quote was, \u201cWe are unwilling to postpone.\u201d He has a clipped section of the original prompter script, given to him by Caroline Kennedy, framed and hanging in his private study in the White House. Bobby Kennedy, Biden has often said, was one of two heroes \u2013 along with Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 for him as a young man entering politics. He keeps busts of both on his desk in the Oval Office. But the connection for Biden is about more than political inspiration. After the car crash that killed Biden\u2019s first wife and baby daughter a few weeks after he was first elected to the Senate in 1972, Ted Kennedy was a consoler and confidant, another young senator who had worked his way through grief and mourning in office. That meant many long sessions in Kennedy\u2019s office in the Hart Senate Office Building. Less known, though arguably more meaningful to the future president, were multiple train trips Kennedy made to Delaware to see Biden and his family in those months. Biden has said that the late senator made him feel like he was his little brother. At the opening of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the US Senate in 2015, then-Vice President Biden called him \u201cmy tutor and my guide.\u201d On Air Force One last week en route to Belfast with former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (RFK\u2019s grandson, RFK Jr.\u2019s nephew and now Biden\u2019s special envoy to Northern Ireland), Biden called Ethel Kennedy (RFK\u2019s widow and his soon-to-be primary challenger\u2019s mother) to wish her a happy 95th birthday. \u201cHe said he went into politics because of Robert Kennedy, Uncle Ted was a great help when his family died in the car crash and Jack Kennedy was the first Irish president going to Ireland and now he\u2019s the second, and he hopes he can fill Jack\u2019s shoes,\u201d Kerry Kennedy recounted on Instagram with an old picture of Biden and Ethel Kennedy together, framed by a heart. \u201cMum replied, \u2018We love you Joe and Joe!\u2019\u201d At almost the same moment Biden was on that call, second gentleman Doug Emhoff was at the Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, across the bay from the planned presidential announcement, talking about combating hate and antisemitism in a speech introduced by John F. Kennedy\u2019s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg. The event, planned long before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed his presidential paperwork, was just the latest example of how intertwined the Kennedys are with the Biden administration. In addition to Kathleen Kennedy Townsend at the Labor Department and Joe Kennedy in Northern Ireland, Caroline Kennedy \u2013 John F. Kennedy\u2019s daughter and Schlossberg\u2019s mother \u2013 is the ambassador to Australia, and Vicki Kennedy \u2013 Ted Kennedy\u2019s widow \u2013 is the ambassador to Austria. Biden last appeared at the Kennedy Presidential Library last September, to talk about the expansion of his own \u201cCancer Moonshot\u201d effort. He mentioned the solace he had gotten from a letter Vicki Kennedy sent him after Beau Biden\u2019s death, which referred to how family patriarch Joseph Kennedy had once written to a friend after his own had son died about how after the life of someone close ends, \u201cyou wonder what you\u2019re going to do with the rest of yours.\u201d Biden ran for president in 2020 partly because he felt he was running the campaign he had once envisioned for his late son. Asked for Vicki Kennedy\u2019s thoughts about her nephew\u2019s campaign \u2013 or how the family connection might affect her diplomatic work for the man he\u2019s challenging \u2013 a spokesperson from the US Embassy in Austria said only that the \u201cambassador does not make any statements concerning the family, including any political activities of family members.\u201d Then again, the first thing in her personal Twitter account bio after being a proud mother, grandmother and dog lover is that she \u201cbelieve[s] in vaccinations.\u201d An aide to Caroline Kennedy in the US Embassy in Australia did not return a request for comment. Multiple Kennedys and friends of Kennedys talk wistfully about the Bobby they say they used to know, with stories about him saving birds with broken wings and giving them to siblings as gifts, or his environmental work in New York with the group Riverkeeper, which many assumed would lead to a potentially front-running campaign for New York attorney general in 2006 that never materialized. That\u2019s been overtaken in their minds by a sense that he\u2019s lost his way. In addition to their other worries about the campaign, several Kennedys and friends told CNN that out of love for him, they are concerned that a campaign will lead to digging up past pain like his drug problems in the 1980s and a troubled marriage to his second wife, who died in 2012. So the best they can hope for, several said, is that this campaign ends quickly and quietly. If his campaign starts to make waves, though, and if Biden launches his own campaign as expected,  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may end up being what unites the disparate family, one of them joked \u2013 for an event where many Kennedys stand together to endorse Biden.",

            "article_content": "The potential 2024 Republican primary field quickly coalesced on Thursday around a strategy for responding to former President Donald Trump\u2019s indictment: Attack Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor, but stop short of praising Trump. If the news of the former president facing more than 30 counts related to business fraud was unprecedented, the reaction from his possible GOP rivals was, in large part, familiar. Rather than risk the backlash from base voters loyal to Trump, ambitious Republicans zeroed in on a liberal foe. It\u2019s a tactic that underscores the former president\u2019s hold over the Republican Party \u2013 even when under indictment. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, widely viewed as Trump\u2019s most formidable potential Republican opponent, did not mention the former president in his response, instead going after \u201cthe Soros-backed Manhattan District Attorney\u201d \u2013 a reference to the billionaire liberal donor George Soros often at the center of conservative conspiracy theories. Donald Trump indicted by Manhattan grand jury on more than 30 counts related to business fraud \u201cThe weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It is un-American,\u201d DeSantis tweeted. \u201cThe Soros-backed Manhattan District Attorney has consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct. Yet, now he is stretching the law to target a political opponent.\u201d DeSantis also reiterated that he would not \u201cassist in an extradition request\u201d for Trump, a Florida resident. Trump is expected to appear in court on Tuesday in New York, where he had lived most of his life. Former Vice President Mike Pence, for years one of Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders before offering some measured criticism after the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, called the indictment of his former boss \u201can outrage\u201d and suggested that Bragg was politically motivated. Pressed by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, who noted that a grand jury voted to charge Trump, Pence doubled down. \u201cBut when you have an attorney general in New York, a Manhattan DA, that targeted one particular American in their campaigns, I think that offends the notion of the overwhelming majority of the American people who believe in fairness, who believe in equal treatment before the law,\u201d he told Blitzer in an interview Thursday evening. Bragg already had some name recognition among Republicans who sought to tie his progressive positions on criminal justice \u2013 in a city they often depict as being besieged by violent crime \u2013 to national Democrats like President Joe Biden. In the run-up to the indictment and then in its immediate aftermath, even those Republicans who have been more willing to criticize Trump denounced Bragg\u2019s investigation as a political stunt or an abuse of power. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, another Republican weighing a presidential bid, sent a similar message on social media. Like DeSantis and others, he focused on Bragg and ignored the substance of the charges against Trump. \u201cIt is beyond belief that District Attorney Alvin Bragg has indicted a former President and current presidential candidate for pure political gain,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cArresting a presidential candidate on a manufactured basis should not happen in America.\u201d Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and Trump\u2019s first ambassador to the United Nations, is the only Republican heavyweight apart from Trump to formally declare her candidacy. She too toed a middle ground, tweeting, \u201cThis is more about revenge than it is about justice,\u201d and posted a clip of a recent Fox News interview in which she denounced Bragg\u2019s case as a \u201cpolitical prosecution.\u201d Republican leaders and Trump loyalists on Capitol Hill rally behind the former president after indictment Another Trump Cabinet official considering a primary run, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accused Bragg of \u201cundermining America\u2019s confidence in our legal system.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who has been making swings through Iowa, called Trump\u2019s indictment a \u201ctravesty\u201d and railed against Bragg and the \u201cfar left\u201d in a statement. \u201cThis pro-criminal New York DA has failed to uphold the law for violent criminals, yet weaponized the law against political enemies,\u201d Scott said. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a more ardent Trump critic than other potential candidates, offered a more measured take, reiterating his opposition to Trump\u2019s attempt to win back the White House, but still saving his toughest criticism for the prosecutor. \u201cIt is a dark day for America when a former President is indicted on criminal charges. While the grand jury found credible facts to support the charges, it is important that the presumption of innocence follows Mr. Trump,\u201d Hutchinson said in a statement. He added: \u201cFinally, it is essential that the decision on America\u2019s next President be made at the ballot box and not in the court system. Donald Trump should not be the next President, but that should be decided by the voters.\u201d But even as the GOP falls in line behind Trump, the political fallout remains unclear. Trump commands a deeply loyal following and leads in most early primary polls. Still, voters largely rejected his favored candidates during the midterms and his indictment will raise further questions about his viability in 2024. For his part, Trump has been consistent in denouncing Bragg and raising money from supporters off the indictment. \u201cThe Deep State will use anything at their disposal to shut down the one political movement that puts YOU first,\u201d his campaign said in a Thursday evening email to supporters. Even before the indictment, Trump and his allies looked to turn the potential charges against him into a litmus test for his would-be challengers. \u201cIt has been over 24 hours and some people are still quiet. History will judge their silence,\u201d a Trump campaign account tweeted after Trump first said earlier this month that he would be arrested. Despite not naming names, the target was clear. DeSantis\u2019 careful efforts to keep Trump at arm\u2019s length while competing for some of his supporters became increasingly fraught in the shadow of an anticipated indictment. The Florida governor road-tested his response in mid-March \u2013 criticizing Bragg while also poking at Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,\u201d DeSantis said to laughs at a news conference in Panama City. \u201cI just, I can\u2019t speak to that.\u201d Before that, he told reporters, \u201cI have no interest in getting involved in some manufactured circus by some Soros-DA.\u201d The \u201cporn star\u201d punchline drew the ire of Trump and was left out of DeSantis\u2019 comments after news broke on Thursday. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2013 who ran against Trump in 2016, then became an ally ahead of the 2020 election before reversing course and insisting this week that he would never back Trump again \u2013 was silent on Thursday night. But in a Fox News interview last week, he predicted an indictment would help the former president among Republican voters and criticized Bragg. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the crime of the century,\u201d Christie said, \u201cand it\u2019s certainly not a case that is going to improve, as I said, the everyday lives of the citizens of Manhattan.\u201d Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper earlier this month that he needed more information before making a judgment, instead turning his ire at political opponents and the press. \u201cI just think that the \u2013 not just the media, but really a lot of the Democrats have misplayed this, in terms of building sympathy for the former president,\u201d Sununu said. \u201cAnd it does drastically change the paradigm as we go into the \u201924 election.\u201d The indictment comes in connection with the yearslong investigation into a hush money scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels. The case relates to a $130,000 payment made by Trump\u2019s then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in late October 2016 to prevent her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair. According to court filings in Cohen\u2019s own federal prosecution, Trump Org. executives authorized payments to him totaling $420,000 to cover his original $130,000 payment and tax liabilities and reward him with a bonus. Trump has denied knowledge of the payment. Along with the hush money investigation, Trump has been surrounded by a number of other legal woes. In Atlanta, Fulton County prosecutors are considering bringing racketeering and conspiracy charges in connection with Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. While in Washington, a Justice Department special counsel is looking into Trump\u2019s conduct around the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents.

            "article_content": "When Nabilah Islam began running for Congress in the 2020 cycle, she said she quickly discovered the high price of her decision. \u201cIt was impossible for me to have a full-time job and wage a competitive campaign,\u201d the Georgia Democrat recalled. So, she gave up her work as a campaign consultant, paused paying her student loans and went without health insurance \u2013 in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 because she could no longer afford to pay the premiums. She drained her savings to pay living expenses. \u201cI was eating ramen and turkey sandwiches every day,\u201d said Islam, who lost her bid for a House seat and now serves in the Georgia state Senate. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I had ever done in my life.\u201d Now, the Federal Election Commission is taking up a request that Islam lodged in 2021 to change some of the federal rules governing the use of political cash. At a hearing Wednesday, the regulators weighed boosting the amount of campaign money candidates can use to pay themselves while running for office. They also are considering whether to allow federal candidates to use donors\u2019 money to underwrite health insurance premiums and other benefits. Although the FEC now allows candidates to use campaign funds to pay themselves a salary, the agency set strict limits. That salary is capped at the annual salary for the office they are seeking or their earnings in the year before they became a candidate, whichever is the lower amount. The limits are aimed at preventing candidates from enriching themselves at donors\u2019 expense, but they also bar candidates who were unemployed or at home caring for children in the prior year from using contributors\u2019 money to draw a candidate salary. Supporters of the change say it would make it easier for a broader spectrum of Americans to run for federal office, including full-time caregivers, students and people from working-class backgrounds. But critics question whether it would encourage grift. \u201cThe reality is that giving up your salary for a year or two to run for Congress is unsustainable for most working people,\u201d said Liuba Grechen Shirley, a former House candidate and founder and CEO of the Vote Mama Foundation, which aims to overcome the obstacles mothers face in running for office. She supports the rule change. \u201cWe have to make it the norm that candidates pay themselves a livable wage, so that they can run for office because that\u2019s how we start to change the system,\u201d she told CNN in an interview this week. Running for Congress is a time-consuming and expensive enterprise. The average successful House winner in the 2022 midterms spent nearly $2.8 million in campaign funds, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that tracks political money. And members of Congress, as a group, are far wealthier than the general US population. An OpenSecrets analysis of congressional financial disclosures reports in 2020 found that more than half the people in Congress that year were millionaires. Although a record number of women serve in Congress, they still make up just over a quarter of total representation, according to the Center for American Woman and Politics (CAWP) at Rutgers University. Only about 28% of all candidates for the House in 2022 were women, said Kelly Dittmar, CAWP\u2019s director of research, underscoring that the gender disparities start long before Election Day. \u201cIf you could tell a potential candidate that they would have greater financial security if they decided to wage a campaign for office, then it might increase the pool of candidates, including women,\u201d Dittmar said. The limits don\u2019t just affect women. Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, who last year became the first Gen Z candidate to win a congressional seat, told the commissioners he \u201cput himself in a bad financial place\u201d by seeking a House seat. The 26-year-old Democrat said he left his job at a gun-violence prevention organization to run for office but quickly realized that he couldn\u2019t sustain campaigning and driving part-time for Uber as he had planned. Frost drew headlines late last year after a landlord denied his application to rent an apartment in Washington, DC, because of his low credit score. \u201cI did overcome the odds,\u201d he testified Wednesday. \u201cBut there are often consequences when you participate in a system that\u2019s not set up for you.\u201d The FEC, which is not likely to make a decision in the coming weeks, is considering a range of options. Among them: Allowing candidates to earn, on a pro-rated basis, up to 50% \u2013 or as much as 100% \u2013 of the federal office they are seeking, regardless of what they earned in the year before they launched their campaigns. Rank-and-file members of Congress earn $174,000 a year, with those in top leadership positions collecting more. Other options include allowing candidates to receive a salary that\u2019s tied to a $15-an-hour rate or to the minimum wage set by federal or state law. So far, a range of individuals and organizations \u2013 including the campaign arms for House Democrats and Republicans \u2013 have expressed general support for a change, although they diverge on the specific remedies. Some Republicans on the panel, including Commissioner James \u201cTrey\u201d Trainor, questioned whether the agency is overstepping its bounds by weighing a rule change and should instead ask Congress to change the federal law that bars candidates from converting campaign contributions to personal use. Bradley Smith, a former Republican FEC commissioner, testified that the agency should be wary of going too far with \u201cfeel-good rule-making.\u201d \u201cWhy not allow candidates to pay for haircuts, better clothes, better food to keep a candidate\u2019s energy up and fundraising or recharging time at the country club, all of which could be helpful to a campaign?\u201d he asked. The commission also is considering whether to allow candidates to begin drawing a donor-funded salary as soon as they file a statement of candidacy rather than waiting, as is currently required, for primary ballot deadlines, which vary widely by state. Frost, the freshman congressman from Florida, also urged the commission to allow candidates to continue drawing a campaign salary after the election as they wait for their salaries as officeholders to kick in. Although the FEC often deadlocks along partisan lines, the commission has signaled an openness to easing some rules for candidates in the past. In 2018, the agency opened the door to candidates using campaign contributions to pay for child care benefits, following a request from Grechen Shirley. She said she did so after trying for months to juggle care for her small children while running for a House seat in Long Island. \u201cI would literally be nursing my son, while my daughter put hairclips in my hair, and I\u2019d have my headphones on and would be dialing for dollars,\u201d she said. To date, 59 federal candidates have used campaign dollars for child care, according to Vote Mama. The group now is pressing states around the country to extend the policy to state and local candidates. This year, 19 bills to do so have been introduced in 13 states, Grechen Shirley said. Last year, Islam, 33, made history by becoming the youngest woman and the first Muslim woman elected to the Georgia state Senate. Although she is not currently planning another run for Congress, she said she is determined to see federal policy change. \u201cI\u2019m very persistent,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one should have to go through all that in order to run for office.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is raising the nightmare scenario for Republicans in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 that he might refuse to endorse the party\u2019s nominee if he loses his primary race. The former president\u2019s warning comes as he escalates efforts to try to scare off or damage potential party rivals who are maneuvering ahead of their own possible campaign launches as a so-far-sleepy GOP contest bursts into life. Specifically, Trump is turning on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. These veiled threats foretell his likely attempts to stigmatize their brands in the eyes of Republican primary voters and mirror his successful 2016 caricaturing of rivals. So far, however, his scare tactics aren\u2019t working. In an appearance Thursday on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt\u2019s show, Trump initiated his most concentrated effort yet to intimidate the potential GOP primary field. When asked by Hewitt whether he would commit to backing the GOP nominee if it wasn\u2019t him, he hedged. \u201cIt would depend. I would give you the same answer I gave in 2016 during the debate. \u2026 It would have to depend on who the nominee was,\u201d Trump said. The ex-president\u2019s comment plays into fears that he could dampen turnout among his own loyal voters in the GOP were he to oppose the party\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee or claim that the primary race was rigged against him. Trump struggles to fundraise in early weeks of 2024 campaign It also highlights a needle his potential challengers must thread \u2013 how to build their own coalitions without alienating Trump supporters with full-on attacks on the former president. But given rising debate about Trump\u2019s own standing in the GOP after his election loss in 2020 and a disastrous midterm intervention last year, it also raises the question of whether the twice-impeached former commander in chief is overestimating his own level of support. Trump also used the interview to land new blows on potential rivals for the nomination \u2013 especially Haley, who had previously said she wouldn\u2019t run against him. \u201cShe\u2019s a very ambitious person. She just couldn\u2019t stay in a seat. I said, \u2018You know what, Nikki, if you want to run, you go ahead and run,\u2019\u201d Trump told Hewitt. And he also took a jab at Pompeo and his new autobiography. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the book yet. I haven\u2019t read it, though I heard he was generally nice. \u2026 He took a little bit more credit than he should, but that\u2019s OK with me,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cWe did a great job. I got along very well with Mike.\u201d Haley is expected to launch a campaign on February 15 in Charleston, a source familiar with her plans told CNN Tuesday. Pompeo, promoting his score-settling new book on the conservative media circuit, is making the kind of political throat-clearing noises typical of would-be candidates. And South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is setting off on a listening tour focusing on faith. The first two stops just happen to include Iowa and his own state \u2013 early voting pillars that will frame the GOP primary contest early next year. This sudden flurry of activity follows Trump\u2019s initial-two state campaign swing last weekend, which saw the former president slam another potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who he claims is showing disloyalty by considering his own run. This prompted a veiled counter-punch from the rising star of Republican politics, who noted pointedly that he \u2013 unlike you know who \u2013 had won reelection. Trump remains the only declared GOP candidate and this early shadow boxing comes a year before ballots are cast in the only true test of political viability. But the first stirrings of the Republican race are important because they will help shape what is already certain to be a turbulent campaign that, given the dominance of election denialism in the GOP\u2019s grassroots, could be another election that tests US democracy. Increasingly clear indications of several forming campaigns are notable because they appear to show that Trump, who has been the most influential force in the GOP ever since 2016, is not so prohibitively formidable that he cannot be challenged by serious rivals. It would be too much to say that his rivals sense weakness given the former president\u2019s deeply loyal bond with activist Republicans who decide primaries. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate Republican who is hardly a Trump acolyte and himself considering a 2024 bid, said when pressed in an interview with Hewitt on Thursday that he would support Trump if he were the party\u2019s nominee. (Though he appeared to backtrack hours later following Trump\u2019s remarks to Hewitt, saying he wouldn\u2019t \u201ccommit to supporting\u201d the former president given his ambiguity over backing the party\u2019s 2024 pick.) But Trump\u2019s so-so fundraising to date, his low-energy launch last year and his infrequent campaign appearances underscore his electoral liabilities, especially after his often-disastrous midterm interventions. Still, having multiple rivals would help Trump, as it did in 2016, since the winner-take-all nature of most Republican primaries allows a candidate with a mere plurality of votes to build up big delegate leads in a crowded field. In other words, if Trump can split the opposition, he can win the primary, but that\u2019s no guarantee for the general election given that the twice-impeached former president left Washington in disgrace after trying to steal an election and fomenting a mob attack on the US Capitol. Haley\u2019s expected campaign launch will highlight a political persona with considerable appeal as Republicans wonder how to broaden their coalition after their general election loss in 2020. Haley has an advantage as the former governor of a southern state that could be one of the most decisive primary battlegrounds, and her career has long been on a trajectory to a presidential race. Her candidacy would bring the historic potential of the first woman in the Oval Office and her South Asian heritage could help the GOP win back women and more moderate voters. She added some foreign policy experience to her resume with a spell as the US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. Unlike many of his Cabinet members, she engineered a smooth exit from the Trump administration on her own terms. Her photo-op departure meeting with Trump in the Oval Office even then looked like potential footage for a future Republican primary campaign. Haley is not being subtle about her pitch \u2013 one that could allow her to gently argue that it\u2019s time to move on from the ex-president and President Joe Biden without directly repudiating the Trump presidency and his fans. \u201cIt is time for a new generation. It is time for more leadership. \u2026 We have to remember, too, we have lost the last seven out of eight popular votes for president,\u201d Haley said in a Fox News interview last month. \u201cIt is time we get a Republican in there that can lead and that can win a general election.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to be 80 years old to be a leader in DC.\u201d Yet the most fundamental question that Haley will face is whether the Republican base, which has rewarded culture warriors, extreme \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rhetoric and election denialists, has any interest at all in what she plans to sell. Her credentials look formidable in isolation but less so when considering the values of the party whose nomination she is seeking. For example, is there really a market in the GOP for a more unifying, multicultural, less strident delivery vehicle for Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d creed? After all, the ex-president\u2019s bombast, occasional profanity and laceration of liberal government and media elites create more of an emotional rather than a directly ideological connection with his biggest fans. For sure, Haley might have advantages in a general election that would elude Trump, but she\u2019s got to get past him first. Haley\u2019s struggles to reconcile her past links with Trump and his wilder, anti-democratic outbursts, suggest she is vulnerable to counter-attacks from the former president focusing on her ambition and perceived shifting loyalties. For instance, after leaving the administration on good terms, she rebuked her party for following Trump down a \u201cpath he shouldn\u2019t have\u201d taken with his election denialism that led to the January 6, 2021, insurrection. But with Trump still a powerful figure in the GOP, she repositioned herself in October 2021. \u201cWe need him in the Republican Party. I don\u2019t want us to go back to the days before Trump,\u201d Haley said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Trump, having said over the weekend that he\u2019d told her to \u201cdo it\u201d when she called him, is already homing in on Haley\u2019s reversals. He put out a video on his Truth Social network Wednesday of Haley saying in 2021 that she wouldn\u2019t run for president if he did. And the former South Carolina governor\u2019s casting around for the GOP sweet spot has some observers wondering exactly how she will build a sufficiently wide support base to take her to the nomination. \u201cI think there is just room for three candidates in this race. The more anti-Trumper \u2013 not a never Trumper, the Trump lite, which is where Ron DeSantis is, (and) Nikki Haley, and then Trump himself,\u201d said former Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who is now a senior CNN political commentator. \u201cNikki Haley\u2019s struggle is going to be: she\u2019s been pro-Trump, anti-Trump, she said she isn\u2019t going to run if he runs, now he is going to run. She doesn\u2019t really have a natural constituency yet. She\u2019s a smart lady, so we will see how she goes.\u201d Haley isn\u2019t the only Republican sending signals that they are ready to challenge Trump. Pompeo is delivering broad hints of a potential 2024 campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve spent time in Iowa and New Hampshire. This is not random,\u201d he said at a forum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to figure our way through this. It is an unbelievably momentous decision to say you believe you should be the leader of the United States of America,\u201d he added. Pompeo appears to have an even more acute positioning issue than Haley, since he was the ex-president\u2019s effective enforcer at the State Department and while director of the CIA, and shared many of the populist, nationalist foreign policy instincts of his former boss. Almost everything that a GOP primary voter could get from Pompeo, they might be able to get from Trump, although the West Point graduate and former Kansas congressman would no doubt argue that he boasts a calmer temperament. But Pompeo \u2013 like Haley, Scott, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, more marginal candidates and even DeSantis, if he gets in the race \u2013 all face the same problem. They might not fear Trump, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can beat him. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

The powerful spending panels in Congress oversee an annual federal budget of roughly $1.7 trillion and are responsible for crafting policies that affect nearly every corner of American life. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018We have to give you a seat at the table.\u2019 Hell, we are the table,\u201d said DeLauro. \u201cIt\u2019s four of us here \u2013 five with Shalanda Young \u2013 who are controlling, really, the most powerful levers of government.\u201d And with deadlines to fund the government and raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit looming later this year, it will be up to these four women to pull the country back from the brink of fiscal calamity \u2013 no easy task in a divided and hyper-polarized government, and with razor-thin majorities in both chambers. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be hurdles thrown at us every single day, and we all recognize that. There\u2019s going to be people who try and keep us from being successful every single day,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI have no doubt this is going to be one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done since I\u2019ve been here. What I feel good about is I have great partners on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of our caucuses.\u201d In an exclusive joint TV interview, the quartet sat down with CNN to candidly discuss how they plan to approach their work, the pressure to prove women can do the job just as effectively \u2013 if not better \u2013 than their male counterparts, and why they think it\u2019s taken so long to crack the \u201cboy\u2019s club\u201d in Washington. \u201cIt is a very special time that we\u2019re working together,\u201d said Granger, who was the first Republican woman to represent Texas in the US House of Representatives and the first female mayor of Fort Worth. \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked together on different things. But this is a difference. I think it\u2019s going to be very important for young women to see us do this.\u201d Women are already following in their footsteps. A young female staffer to Granger went on to also become Fort Worth mayor. And before taking the reins at OMB, Young \u2013 the first Black woman to lead the agency \u2013 was a top aide on the House Appropriations Committee, involved in key funding negotiations and respected by members on both sides of the aisle. Granger, 80, made history in 2019 with then-Rep. Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, when they both helmed the House Appropriations Committee. It was the first time a pair of women had led a congressional panel since 1977, when two female lawmakers oversaw the House Select Committee on the Beauty Shop, which supervised operations at the beauty salon in a House office building. \u201cIt was never viewed that women could take on the issues of foreign policy, budget, finance, any of these areas,\u201d said DeLauro, 79. \u201cIt was the soft side of the government.\u201d All of the Four Corners were elected in the 1990s, when women in Congress were still scarce. Murray, 72, recalled that her Senate class was known as the \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d \u2013 and there were only six female senators following her election in 1992. She said men would treat her with trepidation when she was in the room. Now the tables have turned, with a record number of women serving in office and holding key positions of power. Murray recently became the first woman to serve as Senate president pro tempore, a senior position in the chamber that puts her third in line to the presidency. \u201cWe wanted to create an opening for a male to be head of the Beauty Shop,\u201d Collins, 70, quipped about women climbing the ranks. DeLauro, who is known for her colorful fashion choices and purple-streaked hair, then offered up a different idea for a committee the men could now lead: \u201cThe barber shop!\u201d With Nancy Pelosi stepping down from the top House leadership position in the Democratic Party, the \u201cBig Four\u201d congressional leaders are now all men. Newly minted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy \u2013 who oversees a paper-thin GOP majority that includes an emboldened right flank \u2013 is demanding spending cuts in exchange for lifting the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, heightening the risk of a default and further complicating the work ahead for the Four Corners. When asked if they could guarantee there would be no government shutdowns on their watch, Murray responded carefully, likely a recognition that some things are out of their control: \u201cNone of us want chaos. All of us want our families and our communities and our businesses and the people we represent to know that they can go to work, take care of their families and know we\u2019re here at work doing what needs to be done.\u201d The group feels a sense of responsibility to show that negotiations can be successful, with collegiality, camaraderie and compromise \u2013 and not the bluster and brinkmanship that has defined past funding fights. DeLauro and Granger already have two years of experience working together atop the House spending panel. With Republicans taking control of the House earlier this month, Granger is now chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and DeLauro the ranking Democrat. Murray will become chairwoman of Senate Appropriations Committee with Collins as the ranking Republican. \u201cThere\u2019s maybe not this sense that you have to outdo or outshine or so forth. We know what has to get done,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cAnd we want to make sure that we\u2019re giving each other the strength to do it.\u201d \u201cWe can be tough, and we can be nice,\u201d Murray added. Collins concurred: \u201cWe can be both at the same time.\u201d Decades working in government, they say, has illuminated some differences between how male and female legislators tend to operate. \u201cWomen, they\u2019re good listeners. And you learn a lot by listening, not just talking,\u201d Granger said. \u201cWe do share information about what we\u2019re doing, which is very helpful.\u201d Those differences are especially apparent when it comes to how female lawmakers feel more pressure to do their homework. \u201cEvery woman legislator that I know takes a thick briefing book home every single night,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAnd I remember (former Tennessee Republican) Sen. Fred Thompson \u2026 once saying to one of our male colleagues: \u2018Susan has a secret. She prepares.\u2019\u201d Other differences are more literal. Murray said her plush office space in the Capitol \u2013 one of the perks of her senior position \u2013 used to be occupied by men who smoked cigars. She\u2019s glad it no longer is.",

            "article_content": "The far-right of the House Republican Party nominated Rep. Byron Donalds from Florida for speaker as the floor fight over the gavel continued Wednesday. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who nominated Donalds, got two standing ovations from both sides of the aisle, including from GOP leader Kevin McCarthy when he said, \u201cFor the first time in history there have been two Black Americans placed into the nomination for speaker of the House.\u201d \u201cWe do not seek to judge people by the color of their skin, but the content of their character,\u201d he added, quoting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream,\u201d speech to a second standing ovation. Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries from New York, whom Democrats have nominated for speaker across all six ballots, is expected to become the first Black leader of any major party when the dust settles on the House floor fight for speaker. So far, Donalds has collected 20 votes each in the fourth, fifth and sixth ballots for speaker, blocking McCarthy\u2019s path to victory. The House adjourned until 8 p.m. ET Wednesday. Donalds voted for McCarthy on the first two ballots, but broke from the majority of his colleagues to vote for Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio on the third ballot with conservative hardliners. \u201cRight now, he doesn\u2019t have a pathway to get there,\u201d Donalds told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins after voting against McCarthy Tuesday. \u201cIf that reemerges, yeah, I can be there, that\u2019s fine, but what\u2019s necessary now is that Republicans come together and find a way to elect a speaker.\u201d Donalds is serving his second term, winning his first election in 2020 after GOP Rep. Francis Rooney vacated Florida\u2019s 19th Congressional District seat, and his second in 2022 in a landslide victory. During his first campaign, Donalds described himself in a political ad as a \u201cTrump-supporting, gun-owning, liberty-loving, pro-life, politically incorrect Black man.\u201d In the same political ad, Donalds describes being arrested as a young man for drug possession and deciding to get his life together \u201cthrough the grace of God.\u201d Donalds was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by a \u201csingle mom with three kids, two jobs and not much else,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to my mom and her influence, what could have been the end of my road was just the beginning.\u201d Both Roy and Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who nominated Donalds on the sixth ballot, referred to Donalds overcoming \u201cadversity\u201d and \u201chumble beginnings\u201d to get to the House floor, mentioning his upbringing. The Florida State University graduate worked in the banking, finance, and insurance industries before being elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016, according to his office. Donalds, 44, lives in Naples, Florida, with his wife and three sons. CORRECTION: This story has been updated with the correct spelling of Byron Donalds\u2019 first name.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey is a longtime journalist based in South Carolina and the Batten Professor for Communication Studies at Davidson College. His latest book is \u201cWhy Didn\u2019t We Riot? A Black Man in Trumpland.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. I first met Nikki Haley during her initial run for governor of South Carolina in 2010 at a luncheon at Magnolia\u2019s, a Myrtle Beach buffet-style restaurant popular with the locals. Though she had served in the state\u2019s House of Representatives for several years, I didn\u2019t know her well \u2013 and neither did most people in the state. The luncheon was being hosted in the aftermath of the scandal plaguing South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who had snuck out of the country to see his mistress but told his staff he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. After listening to Haley give a fairly routine stump speech, I asked Haley, if she won, would she resign as governor if she made as big a misstep as Sanford had. \u201cI won\u2019t mess up like him,\u201d she said without hesitation. As governor of South Carolina, she never messed up like Sanford, who also had strong presidential prospects before his escapades. But she messed up when she decided to embrace Donald Trump \u2013 rather than keeping him at arm\u2019s length \u2013 providing further proof that even the most talented Republicans were willing to bend the knee to the former president. Though she released a video on Tuesday announcing her intention to run against Trump for president in 2024, Haley has lost the moral high ground she once had over him. To be clear, Haley never really had the moral high ground; she just created the illusion of having it. She is as politically ambitious as any man or woman who has considered themselves qualified enough to lead the world\u2019s most powerful nation. However, her principles have often seemed an afterthought or conditional on circumstance. And despite Haley\u2019s ambitions, former President Donald Trump is still the top contender for the nomination. His most loyal supporters, which still number in the millions, won\u2019t abandon him just because of a loss in 2020 \u2013 which many of them falsely believe was stolen from him \u2013 and a bad 2022 midterm cycle for Trump-backed candidates. But if, for some reason, he stumbles or gets embroiled in too many legal battles, Haley should be considered a serious contender. After all, you don\u2019t get elected twice as governor of Deep South, Bible Belt South Carolina as a woman with dark skin and a Sikh background by happenstance. And though Haley\u2019s embrace of Trumpism was undoubtedly a mistake, there were early indications from her time as governor that her priority was not always the people of South Carolina, but her own political aspirations. Opinion: Trump's first challenger is the one GOP needs In 2013, then-Gov. Haley and a Republican-dominated General Assembly denied the expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to hundreds of thousands of low-income South Carolinians. She even opposed creating a statewide health care exchange under that law. Health officials in her administration told me at the time that there were simply better options, but it was clear to close observers in the state it was primarily about political expedience \u2013 especially when Haley declared that she would not expand Medicaid on President Barack Obama\u2019s watch. About 40% of the state\u2019s uninsured adults would have received health coverage under an expansion, as well as low-wage workers in retail and hospitality who are concentrated in Horry County, home to resort destination Myrtle Beach, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A White House study said expansion could have saved about 200 lives in the state every year through early detection and treatment. And a University of South Carolina study estimated the state could have seen an additional 44,000 jobs added by 2020 with the multibillion dollar federal investment from a Medicaid expansion. Indeed, Haley, a self-avowed \u201cpro-life\u201d advocate, stood in the way of life-saving Obamacare \u2013 exposing her hypocrisy on an issue that has come to define the modern-day Republican Party. Her stance on taxes wasn\u2019t much better. Haley adhered to the tax cuts today, tax cuts tomorrow, tax cuts forever boilerplate conservative talking point while in the governor\u2019s mansion. She wanted to cut income taxes in the state, even when fellow Republicans said the cuts would be too steep. Haley proposed a tax swap, a lowering of the top marginal income tax rate for the wealthiest South Carolinians in exchange for an increase in the gas fee that everyone pays. And she kept pushing for tax cuts even in her final budget proposal. She did not get her way often. Opinion: Americans deserve more than a Biden-Trump rematch Of course, many of her supporters point to her handling of the Confederate flag as a sign of her sincere commitment to the people of South Carolina, and particularly the Black community. But even that is questionable at best. The blood of Black South Carolinians had to be spilled before that flag would be removed. After White supremacist Dylann Roof massacred innocent Black churchgoers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in 2015, Haley took the lead on the decision to take the Confederate battle flag off the South Carolina State House. But for years prior to the mass shooting, Haley had dodged the issue, claiming \u2013 falsely \u2013 that there was no push in South Carolina for the flag to come down. \u201cWhat I can tell you is over the last three and a half years, I spent a lot of my days on the phones with CEOs and recruiting jobs to this state,\u201d she said during a debate as she ran for re-election in 2014 against Democratic challenger Vincent Sheheen. \u201cI can honestly say I have not had one conversation with a single CEO about the Confederate flag.\u201d Haley had not taken any steps to get the flag lowered, or even hinted that she would try, before that ugly night in Charleston. And just a few years ago, she claimed Roof had \u201chijacked\u201d the meaning of the flag that some South Carolinians embraced as part of a proud heritage. Still, by making the decision to remove the flag at the time she did, Haley successfully sold the idea that she cared. That decision, paired with her actions on key GOP priorities \u2013 from health care to taxes \u2013 positioned her well within the party. Haley was even tasked with giving the response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union in 2016, a sign of the party\u2019s faith in her abilities and ambitions. But when Trump first declared, Haley was an early critic. In February 2016, she said she would not endorse Trump, explaining that he is \u201ceverything a governor doesn\u2019t want in a president.\u201d She continued to criticize him as she campaigned with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, whom she had endorsed for president. Then Haley reversed course when Trump became the nominee, and she landed the type of position in his administration that would provide her with the foreign policy experience she\u2019d need for a presidential run: US ambassador to the United Nations. She could plausibly claim to have taken the position to serve her country \u2013 not Trump. Her approach seemed to work. She had good standing among staunch Trump supporters but had not alienated those who considered themselves moderates and Never Trumpers when she left her position at the UN. As a South Carolina voter who had sworn off the Republican Party, I was even intrigued by what she had pulled off.  All of these strategic decisions make her a contender worth watching in the primary season. But they are also an important reminder of where so many of the leaders of the Republican Party are today \u2013 comfortable with embracing leaders who traffic in bigotry and racism when it\u2019s beneficial in an election cycle, but equally comfortable using race and gender to protect the GOP against barbs from Democrats and others about White supremacy and misogyny. That\u2019s precisely how Haley defended South Carolina against accusations that the flying of the flag of traitors who tried to establish a new country built on the premise of permanent black enslavement was harming the state\u2019s image. It\u2019s a heads I win-tails you lose version of identity politics. \u201cBut we really kind of fixed all that when you elected the first Indian-American female governor,\u201d Haley said during that 2014 debate in South Carolina. \u201cWhen we appointed the first African-American U.S. senator [Tim Scott], that sent a huge message.\u201d On that count, Haley is in a strong position. She embodies the party well. But her embrace of Trump made him look stronger and her weaker. She\u2019ll have to climb a mountain of her own making to win the nomination against him.",

He is CEO of Gavin James Public Affairs, a public relations and marketing consulting firm in Lexington, South Carolina. During the Trump administration, he was press secretary for the Department of Labor and deputy communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services. Gavin also previously served as an intern and interim executive assistant in the Executive Office of South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news. Nikki R. Haley, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina governor, announced her 2024 presidential bid in a video on Tuesday. Haley, whose camp has been distributing invitations to a \u201cspecial announcement\u201d set for February 15 in Charleston, South Carolina, is the first Republican to officially declare a challenge against former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. As someone who has worked for both Haley and Trump, I believe Haley is exactly the right candidate for the Republican Party at this moment \u2013 and fellow Republicans should think twice before underestimating her. Haley was an unknown in 2004 when she took on and defeated the longest serving Republican in the South Carolina House of Representatives by running a grassroots campaign that positioned her as an energetic and fresh-faced underdog. Her star rose quickly as the majority whip in the South Carolina General Assembly, and she jumped into the South Carolina gubernatorial race in 2009. In the good ole\u2019 boys club that is South Carolina politics, Haley wasn\u2019t taken seriously as a gubernatorial candidate by many until former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, visited the Palmetto State in May 2010 and endorsed her. Palin, who also appeared in a campaign ad calling Haley a \u201cstrong, pro-family, pro-life, pro-second amendment, pro-development, conservative reformer\u201d helped boost Haley\u2019s campaign, which went from being on life-support to frontrunner-status in a field of all White male opponents. Haley shocked the political establishment in South Carolina when she won the Republican primary just a month later. In November 2010, Haley trounced her Democratic challenger in the general election \u2013 earning her the distinction of becoming both the first female governor of South Carolina and the second governor in the country of Indian descent. Opinion: McCarthy's committee vengeance could pose a grave risk Under Haley\u2019s leadership, South Carolina thrived. Unemployment rates fell and South Carolina\u2019s Department of Commerce announced tens of thousands of jobs had been created under her tenure and billions in capital investment flowed into the state. She also spearheaded efforts to pass a law that added transparency to the legislative process and required South Carolina lawmakers to vote on the record more frequently. In the aftermath of the 2015 mass-shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, Haley worked tirelessly to unify our state and successfully led the efforts to remove the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina State House grounds. Later that year, she was calm and composed leading the state when Hurricane Matthew made landfall and historic floods wreaked havoc on residents of our state. Despite these accomplishments, and a very successful reelection campaign in 2014, Trump is said to have rejected Haley as a potential secretary of state, citing a \u201ccomplexion problem,\u201d and noting the \u201cblotch marks on her cheeks\u201d in a conversation with then-Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to the book \u201cThe Divider,\u201d by New Yorker writer Susan Glasser and New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker. He opted instead to appoint her the US ambassador to the United Nations, where she quickly became a leader in the Republican Party for her no-nonsense and direct approach to diplomacy. From cutting more than $285 million from the UN budget to leading the charge to pull out of the disgraced UN Human Rights Council, Haley quickly built a name for herself as a successful US diplomat who got things done. When she resigned in 2018, she was one of the few Trump administration officials to stay in the good graces of the former president, with the New York Times editorial page praising Haley as \u201cthat rarest of Trump appointees: one who can exit the administration with her dignity largely intact.\u201d But Haley\u2019s relationship with Trump has grown more complicated since she left the administration. She spoke out against him after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol before changing her tune in October 2021, telling the Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe need him in the Republican Party. I don\u2019t want us to go back to the days before Trump.\u201d  And when the news broke that she was expected to announce a run for president, Trump took a shot at her by sharing a video of Haley from April 2021, when she said she would \u201cnot run if President Trump ran\u201d in 2024. When Fox News host Bret Baier brought up those same comments last month, Haley responded by calling for generational change, citing issues like inflation and crime and saying, \u201cA lot has changed.\u201d Ultimately, a dust-up between the former president and any Republican challenger is inevitable. What matters is that Haley is a formidable candidate who brings the executive experience from her days as governor as well as the foreign policy experience from her time as ambassador. This experience, paired with her ability to bring people together, her background as a mom and a military spouse, and her track record of fighting the uphill battle of running against old white men \u2013 is exactly why she is the right candidate, at the right moment, for Republicans to rally behind as we look to win back the White House in 2024.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may be the only top Western official who balked at boarding the train to Kyiv to stand with Ukraine\u2019s warrior president. But the California Republican\u2019s decision to turn down Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s invitation, made in an exclusive interview with CNN, is in keeping with the central premise of his speakership \u2013 appeasing the GOP radicals who keep him in power. But as with his handling of a looming debt ceiling crisis and his efforts to help Tucker Carlson whitewash the Capitol insurrection, McCarthy\u2019s unwillingness to cross lawmakers who want to cut Ukraine\u2019s US lifeline may simply be storing up future national crises that could threaten his hold on power. His precarious position is fast becoming a dominant feature of a critical period of divided government that will define McCarthy\u2019s political career and go a long way toward shaping the 2024 White House race and the legacy of President Joe Biden. The volatile dynamics of the House GOP and the way McCarthy\u2019s tiny majority gives outsize influence to the most committed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d loyalists is also complicating his efforts to train undivided attention on Biden\u2019s new budget to be released Thursday. Trump, McCarthy and Fox run out a new truth-defying playbook Moderate Republicans who helped the GOP win the majority last November are just as important to the party\u2019s hopes of retaining control of the chamber next year as pro-Trump extremists. But their priorities risk being constantly compromised by the speaker\u2019s repeated plays to Trump\u2019s base and the ex-president\u2019s most devoted followers in the House. McCarthy\u2019s balancing act is so far working for him politically. His decision to give January 6 conspiracist Carlson access to US Capitol security tapes sparked a torrent of criticism from the media and some Republican senators, but that counts as a political win with the MAGA crowd. A House Republican resolution blocking a controversial Washington, DC, crime measure, which also passed the Senate Wednesday, caused a split between progressive Democrats and the president, who declined to veto it. And there\u2019s no immediate bill for billions more in aid for Ukraine that could widen the chasm between far-right lawmakers and GOP committee chairmen who want Biden to send more arms and ammunition into the proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. But at some point \u2013 possibly in the looming summer showdown over raising the government\u2019s borrowing authority, which the GOP refuses to do without Biden agreeing to transformative spending cuts \u2013 McCarthy\u2019s strategy could fail in a battle between US interests and the speaker\u2019s political needs. Almost every Western leader who matters, and many who don\u2019t, have now made the daring trip to visit Zelensky, a hero of democracy, in Kyiv. Yet McCarthy, who has a reputation for loving a photo-op with famous people, rebuffed the invitation to visit the Ukrainian leader. \u201cMr. McCarthy, he has to come here to see how we work, what\u2019s happening here, what war caused us, which people are fighting now, who are fighting now. And then after that, make your assumptions,\u201d Zelensky told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. But the California Republican told CNN on Tuesday he had no plans to visit and reiterated the illogical position that Biden had been too slow to help Ukraine but that he would not preside over a \u201cblank check\u201d in assistance for Zelensky\u2019s government. McCarthy\u2019s bridging of two adamant strands of opinion in the House GOP on Ukraine is just about holding. Exclusive: Zelensky invites House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear about what I said: no blank checks, OK? So, from that perspective, I don\u2019t have to go to Ukraine to understand where there\u2019s a blank check or not,\u201d McCarthy told CNN. \u201cI will continue to get my briefings and others, but I don\u2019t have to go to Ukraine or Kyiv to see it.\u201d Zelensky is a shrewd politician who has expertly evoked the history and national mythology of Western nations as he has solicited help in repelling Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 for instance, comparing the onslaught to attacks on US soil at Pearl Harbor and on September 11, 2001. McCarthy would be put in a deeply awkward position if he stood alongside the Ukrainian leader in his wartime capital and repeated his line about allowing no \u201cblank checks.\u201d But making the trip is effectively a political impossibility with his political patron, Trump, accusing Biden of caring more about Ukraine\u2019s borders than America\u2019s. Sooner or later, though, McCarthy may face a choice between the GOP hardliners and the prospect of voting down a future funding bill that Ukraine needs to survive against the Russian assault. Because of concessions he made to win the speakership, it\u2019s not clear he could use Democratic votes without provoking a GOP revolt from hardliners in his conference that could cost him his job. Critics might hope he\u2019d put principle \u2013 defending a pro-Western leader who has risked everything and a democracy Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to obliterate \u2013 ahead of his political viability. But that\u2019s not an approach he\u2019s taken at home following Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election in 2020. Still, McCarthy hasn\u2019t fully adopted demands of his most radical subordinates, like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, for audits or an end to Ukraine aid. His line about a blank check could be interpreted as a holding position between his extremist colleagues and hawkish internationalist Republicans who want to do more. But with Russia only escalating its assault and the GOP presidential primary likely to drag the party toward the anti-aid faction, it\u2019s a position that may crumble before much longer. The speaker is not only treading a dicey path on Ukraine. His strategy heading into a monumental showdown over spending and debt is one that sustains him for now but will require a series of political masterstrokes for him to come out ahead in a head-to-head with Biden. If Congress does not raise the government\u2019s current $31.4 trillion borrowing limit later this year, the government will be unable to fulfill its obligations. There could be delays to Social Security payments, military wages and tax refunds. But Republicans in the House are refusing to act unless Biden agrees to steep spending cuts, and McCarthy apparently gave undertakings to stand firm when he needed the support of GOP budget hawks to finally win the speakership after 15 rounds of chaotic voting in January. Biden is refusing to negotiate, arguing that the debt limit increase is needed to pay for obligations already racked up by Congress and that the GOP previously voted to raise it several times under the free-spending Trump. Republicans eye transformational cuts as Biden seeds a tax hike. Nobody will get exactly what they want Republicans have every right to seek to cut spending. They won the House in the midterm election, albeit narrowly, on their vow to rein in government largesse. But the White House and many financial experts fault them over the debt limit stance because failing to act could shatter the credibility of America\u2019s credit and pitch the global economy into a disaster. McCarthy has so far shown no clear path through this game of Russian roulette. And he\u2019s blaming Biden for not caving into him on his pledge not to negotiate. \u201cHe told me once that he would, I believe eventually he will, but that\u2019s a month wasted. That\u2019s a month that brings more doubt financially. That\u2019s a month that hurts Americans,\u201d McCarthy told reporters on Wednesday evening. McCarthy is betting Biden will blink. The White House insists he will not. And the prosperity and livelihoods of millions of Americans may be on the line. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise on Wednesday accused reporters of being obsessed with the mob assault by Trump supporters on Congress. \u201cIt seems like some in the press want to talk about January 6 every day. So do a lot of Democrats,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. But it was McCarthy who ignited the latest controversy over the insurrection by giving Carlson exclusive access to thousands of hours of surveillance tapes, allowing the Fox host to cherry pick excerpts that bolstered his effort to hide the truth of what happened. And it\u2019s House Republicans who are talking about that day, with Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who chairs a House Administration subcommittee, telling CNN he will examine how the \u201cJanuary 6 committee dropped the ball on what actually happened here in the Capitol.\u201d House GOP plots new January 6 probes despite internal backlash over McCarthy giving Carlson footage Republicans have consistently attempted to put the blame for the most serious attack on US democracy in decades on security failures rather than a president who incited an angry crowd with lies about election fraud and sent them marching to the Capitol with a call to \u201cfight like hell\u201d ringing in their ears. But the MAGA wing of the party\u2019s rewriting of the history of January 6 threatens to perpetuate the very anti-democratic extremism that contributed to Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss and that alienated swing-state voters in the 2022 midterms, thereby saddling McCarthy with such a thin majority. Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the 2021 insurrection, told CNN Wednesday that Fox News and some in his party were wrong to try to rewrite what happened on January 6. \u201cIt\u2019s a revisionist thing that I think is unfair to the American people,\u201d he said. The radical House Republicans using their power to try to reshape the narrative about Trump\u2019s assault on democracy, just as he takes a new tilt at the White House, do not just reflect the character of the new GOP majority. It encapsulates the compromises that McCarthy has made to win power. But on Ukraine and debt at least, the time may be approaching when he faces painful choices that could decide how long he can keep the job he fought so hard to win \u2013 and that will shape America\u2019s future at home and abroad.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Will Cathcart is an American freelance journalist based in Tbilisi. He was previously a media adviser to Mikheil Saakashvili, former president of Georgia. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. When Georgian lawmakers backed a controversial Kremlin-esque bill late Tuesday night, mayhem erupted outside Parliament. As the crowd of protesters grew larger and larger, riot police gathered at their flanks. All hell broke loose. The riot police fired tear gas canisters into the crowd. They used batons and water cannons. The images were remarkable. In one, a woman waving a European Union flag takes on a fire hose \u2014 an apt metaphor for Georgian democracy. By Thursday morning those protests had proved a success. The ruling party retracted its \u201cforeign influence\u201d bill, which would have required organizations receiving 20% or more of their annual income from abroad to register as \u201cforeign agents\u201d or face heavy fines. Though after all the duplicitous justifications they gave for passing it in the first place, the move feels cynical at best. A similar law has been used to dismantle independent media and NGOs in Russia since 2012. But Thursday was a reminder that the Georgian people have the power to reclaim their democracy. (That\u2019s even if the ruling party ends up finding other rights to take away from its people in its desperate attempt not to lose in the upcoming 2024 parliamentary elections.) In the past several years, it appears that the Georgian government has been intentionally subverting its democracy in order to leave the EU and NATO with no choice but to reject it. Which is exactly how Moscow likes it. Georgia's parliament formally revokes 'foreign influence' bill that sparked major protests The Georgian people have fought back at every turn. Whether it is about their government\u2019s refusal to support Ukraine, raids on nightclubs or attacks on journalists covering LGBTQ demonstrations, thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets. The circumstances for these protests are always different. But the reason is always the same. Georgia\u2019s ruling party is turning toward Moscow. Its people are not. The men, women and children who gather before Parliament are essentially sending a message: \u201cWe are Europe. If you intend to take away our democracy, you must first come through us.\u201d Georgians shouldn\u2019t have to get beaten in the streets to exercise their democracy. But they will. Georgia\u2019s informal ruler, the oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, is miscalculating his people just as Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the Ukrainian people. It may sound trite to compare those protesting a bill in front of the Georgian Parliament to the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the slush and mud that was once a city called Bakhmut. But these fighters share what they see as a common enemy, and both know what is at stake. As a journalist living here in Tbilisi for the last 15 years, one gets used to the tear gas. Despite having a chronic lung disease, or more likely on account of it, I get a strange high \u2014 an adrenaline rush at the first whiff of tear gas. In the bright police lights, things take on a cinematic quality. This is why I am here \u2014 to bear witness, while coughing my face off, to thousands of Georgians ready to take a tear gas canister to the face to keep the democracy for which they\u2019ve fought for the last 20 years. As an American, I often get asked why I live here, most often by cynical taxi drivers. The reason is that I\u2019ve always believed that in Georgia, especially as a journalist, one person can make a difference. When Parliament tried to push through a law that would mean I\u2019d have to register as a \u201cforeign agent,\u201d for the first time I questioned my decision to raise my family here. My wife is Georgian, and we have two young boys. I\u2019m not alone in thinking this. I find little comfort in the fact that the law was revoked. For the first time in 15 years, I didn\u2019t feel welcome in Georgia. But there is another thing too. It has taken me 15 years to realize that living in a place where one person can make a difference for the better means that one person also can make a difference for the worse. Still, Ivanishvili is losing his footing. He is making increasingly desperate decisions that indicate a growing animosity toward the United States. By some absurd calculus, Ivanishvili appears to believe that Putin is the only man who can help his ruling Georgian Dream party hold on to power in next year\u2019s elections. He has chosen sides. I don\u2019t see how a country full of designated \u201cforeign agents\u201d could be good for tourism or any sector. Entire farms funded by organizations like USAID and the German development agency GIZ could be labeled foreign intelligence operations while growing tomatoes, blueberries and kiwifruit. There would be black-op asparagus harvests and clandestine apple collections. Perhaps vegetables would come with both non-GMO and non-foreign-agent-funded stickers. I wonder if they would taste any different. Ironically, the actual Russian intelligence agents in Georgia appear to be welcome. In the 10 years since Ivanishvili came to power, it seems that no actual Russian agent has been prosecuted. Hans Gutbrod, who studied similar laws in other countries for the Transparency and Accountability Initiative (TAI), calls it the \u201cWe can repress anyone we like law.\u201d There are \u201cclear tell-tale signs when a law has bad faith. This law here has all of them.\u201d After the bill was withdrawn, Gutbrod told me, \u201cGeorgian Dream is greatly weakened. If it cannot project strength, it will struggle to command the loyalty of local elites, especially of police chiefs, that it needs to win elections.\u201d In response to the government\u2019s violence, US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said, \u201cIt is our strong hope that the Georgian Government listens to the Georgian people.\u201d As of Thursday, that happened. In its attempt to explain why it retracted the bill, the ruling party claimed that \u201cthe radical forces were able to involve some of the youth in illegal activities.\u201d Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili (who is politically independent though her campaign was originally funded by the ruling party), currently visiting the United States, told CNN that the draft law \u201clooks very much like Russian politics.\u201d Elsewhere, Irakli Kobakhidze, the chair of the ruling Georgian Dream, thanked the police and called Georgia\u2019s 2003 Rose Revolution \u201cthe Revolution of Spies.\u201d It is abundantly clear which side he is on. As a journalist living here in Tbilisi for the last 15 years, one gets used to the tear gas. Will Cathcart Meanwhile, former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who led the Rose Revolution, is allegedly being poisoned in a Georgian prison (full disclosure, I was a media advisor to President Saakashvili from 2009-2011). Pro-Western Saakashvili also remains Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s chief reforms adviser, despite his arrest in Georgia in 2021. And as experts have observed, his prison illnesses are part of a familiar pattern in Putin\u2019s Russia. Saakashvili is not inherent or essential to Georgia\u2019s democratic future \u2014 but his death in a Georgian prison would be a blow capable of thwarting Georgia\u2019s democratic aspirations and its relationship with the United States in particular. It would also be a gift to Putin. Ironically, the Georgian Dream government was able to come to power through a peaceful election because of Saakashvili\u2019s genuine commitment to democracy. The ruling party\u2019s increasing hostility toward US and EU ambassadors and its refusal to support Ukraine have cost it a great deal with no apparent payoff. This week\u2019s legislative retraction will make Ivanishvili only look weaker. Tomorrow, he may double down on even more inept legislation.  The retraction of this bill is a much-needed win for civil society. But it also comes with a warning. The ruling party has revealed who they are. The Georgian people should use this opportunity to demand that Saakashvili is pardoned before it is too late. Georgia \u2014 at its heart \u2014 is a democracy. Ivanishvili will learn this the hard way, as will Putin. In the meantime, Georgians will continue staring down fire hoses and tear gas canisters. It is the same reason why Ukrainian troops will prevail. They are fighting for something, not against something. Once you give democracy to a people, it is very difficult to take it away.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. As he was planning his 2000 third-party bid for the presidency, Ralph Nader asked me to meet with him. Nader strongly believed that he could launch a viable Green Party, seizing at least 5% of the national vote, which would qualify the Greens for federal matching funds, and begin to erode what he called \u201cthe two-party duopoly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you can do that,\u201d I told Nader. \u201cBut I am sure of this: If you succeed, you\u2019ll elect George W. Bush.\u201d Nader vehemently disagreed. He thought that then-Vice President Al Gore would still have enough votes to win comfortably, and he wanted to pull him to the left. I failed to dissuade Nader, obviously. The rest, as they say, is history. Bush was credited with a win in Florida by just 537 votes. Nader received 97,488 votes in Florida. Some might say that third-party presidential candidates are like cockroaches in the kitchen. To quote legendary Texas Longhorn football coach Darrell Royal, \u201cIt\u2019s not what they eat and tote off, it\u2019s what they fall into and mess up that hurts.\u201d Opinion: Fox News was never a real news network The good folks of the political organization No Labels are diving into the presidential election of 2024. The organization describes itself as a group that \u201cdemands American leaders and citizens alike declare their freedom from the anger and divisiveness that are ruining our politics and, most importantly, our country.\u201d And yet their central project \u2013 organizing a moderate third-party candidacy for president in 2024 \u2013 would, despite their stated intentions, likely reward the most extreme, most divisive, most angry forces in our politics. In a video on their website, chief strategist Ryan Clancy explains his group is working to get a spot on the ballot in all 50 states, \u201cto create an opening for a presidential ticket that stands for the kind of ideas that appeal to most people, even if it drives the extremes crazy.\u201d What ideas? Well, Clancy says in the video, they\u2019re coming. \u201cSoon.\u201d No Labels, thus far, has offered no concrete ideas or policies. Nothing about whether corporations should pay more in taxes, as Democrats want, or less, as Republicans do. Nothing about whether health care should be more driven by private markets, as Republicans favor, or more heavily subsidized by the government, as Democrats do. All we know is that No Labels rejects partisanship and division and extremism. Here\u2019s the simple political reality, as I see it: In recent elections, most voters who reject extremism have tended to vote Democratic. This means the vast majority of votes that a No Labels presidential candidate would receive would likely come out of President Joe Biden\u2019s pool of potential voters, not former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2013 assuming the 2024 election turns out to be a 2020 rematch. Opinion: The recipe for Ron DeSantis' success Third Way, another centrist public policy group, has a more compelling answer. According to their analysis, a third-party candidate \u201cwould act as a spoiler,\u201d and that the kind of post-partisan candidacy No Labels calls for would pull disproportionately from the Democratic nominee. Simply put, there is no way in the world a third-party candidate can win. But a moderate third-party candidate would, in my estimation, almost certainly elect Mr. Trump. Ross Perot, the most successful independent candidate in modern times, who spent millions of his money on campaigning, won nearly one out of every five votes in 1992 \u2013 and earned precisely zero electoral votes. What made Perot different from the No Labels effort is he drew from both parties. His pro-change, pro-choice, anti-Gulf War, anti-NAFTA positions drew from Democratic candidate Bill Clinton\u2019s voter base, and his pro-business, anti-deficit positions drew from Republican President George H.W. Bush\u2019s base. The strongest third-party candidate ever was former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who got 88 electoral votes \u2013 not near enough to win, but more than enough to swing the 1912 election away from his former GOP prot\u00e9g\u00e9  William Howard Taft and give the presidency to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The best performance by an independent since Roosevelt was Democrat-turned-independent George Wallace, who in 1968 won five states. In the half-century since, not a single independent presidential candidate has won a single electoral vote. Democrats may not want to hear this, but Third Way does not flinch from the facts: Trump got more votes in 2020 than in 2016. After two impeachments, after banning people from Muslim-majority countries, after siding with Putin over US intelligence agencies in Helsinki, after initially saying Covid-19 would \u201cdisappear.\u201d  After all that, he got more raw votes and a higher percentage of the vote in the key swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But whereas Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lost those states in 2016, Biden won them. Why? As Third Way states, \u201cIn 2016, there was a third slice eating into Clinton\u2019s support. In 2020, that third party segment shrank, so Biden\u2019s support eclipsed Trump\u2019s.\u201d In 2016, two third parties \u2013 the Libertarian and the Green parties \u2013 both competed heavily across the country, drawing almost 6 million votes between the two of them. In 2020, voters pulled back from third parties, and they drew closer to 2 million votes. Though that was not the only reason for Biden\u2019s success, as Third Way points out, \u201cBiden won 2016 third-party voters by a 30-point margin.\u201d Of course, there was not a wholesale rejection of Trump\u2019s brand of extremism in 2020, nor is there likely to be in 2024. But a sensible, centrist, moderate, anti-partisan candidate, as No Labels is seeking, will succeed in electing Trump, the most divisive, polarizing politician of modern times.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. It looks like this New Year\u2019s fireworks arrived a few days late to Congress. Despite holding a numerical majority, the House GOP caucus revealed itself to be intractably divided in the election for speaker of the House this week, with Republican frontrunner Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California failing to receive the needed majority of votes. After six rounds of voting, McCarthy is still falling short of the votes needed. House Democrats, meanwhile, have decisively united around Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York as their party leader. Not since 1923 has a speaker of the House failed to be elected on the first ballot. But a century later, with razor thin margins in both houses of Congress the new normal, 2023 is already shaping up to be a politically explosive year. Historically, contested elections for speaker of the House were quite common, with the House deadlocking 13 times before the Civil War. The stalemates typically fell into two categories: those resulting from when the two-party system itself was in flux, and, less commonly but most tellingly for today\u2019s moment, when a vocal minority within the dominant party refused to support the majority\u2019s candidate. In either instance, a compromise of some sort \u2013 whether by choosing a new candidate for speaker or by placating the splinter faction in some significant way \u2013 has usually been the result. If history is any guide, we may once again be living a version of one of these two scenarios. Let\u2019s take a look at three prior examples from the first category, when deadlocked elections speakers resulted from party fissures. Prior to the Civil War, the future of slavery was the most divisive issue facing the nation. In 1849, the Democrats held the plurality of votes in the House, with 113 representatives to the Whigs\u2019 108. However, nine members of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party disrupted the balance of power and extended the speaker balloting for more than 20 days. To end the stalemate, the House decided to adopt a plurality rule, which bypassed the need for a majority. After 63 rounds of balloting, the pro-Union Democrat Howell Cobb of Georgia was elected speaker. Opinion: Why Kevin McCarthy's dream is in big trouble In 1855, the race for speaker faced its most serious challenge yet. Without sufficient Democrats or former Whigs to reach a majority, a compromise candidate was found in Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts, a member of the nativist American Party (also called \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d). Banks, who became speaker after 133 ballots held over two months, defeated Democratic challenger, William Aiken, Jr., of South Carolina, whose backers hoped that a plurality resolution would once again capture the votes of competing factions. Instead, Banks ultimately defeated Aiken on February 2, 1856. Four years later, the House of Representatives was again divided, with a majority of Republicans looking to place Rep. John Sherman of Ohio in the chair. The Republicans tried, but failed, to use the plurality rule to end the debate. When a clear majority still had not emerged, Sherman stepped aside and urged Republicans to support Rep. William Pennington, a freshman congressman from New Jersey. After 44 ballots spanning eight weeks, Pennington was elected speaker. While Kevin McCarthy has expressed his readiness to break the record of 1855-56, there is a second scenario from history that may be more likely \u2013 that from the last time the House failed to select a speaker on the first ballot. In 1923, a progressive faction of western Republicans challenged the selection of the party\u2019s first choice candidate, returning speaker of the House Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts. The progressives blamed the party\u2019s existing orthodoxy on the results of the 1922 midterm election, in which Republicans had seen their majority reduced, and wanted to change the House\u2019s rules to allow for more legislation to reach the floor. Hear what McCarthy told CNN about the possibility of dropping out After deadlocking for eight ballots, an emergency meeting was held between the Republican majority leader Nicholas Longworth of Ohio, and the radical faction, represented by Rep. John M. Nelson of Wisconsin, Rep. Fiorello LaGuardia of New York and Rep. Roy O. Woodruff of Michigan. As a result, the House agreed to a number of procedural reforms and Gillett became speaker. The tolerance for the progressive Republicans was short-lived, however. In 1925, after several progressive Republicans refused to support then-President Calvin Coolidge\u2019s reelection bid, Longworth, who was then speaker, punished them by stripping them of their seniority within House committees. For all intents and purposes, the Republican Party had been purged of its liberal faction. What does this long, strange history of contested speaker elections tell us about today\u2019s divides? In the speaker contests of the 1850s, the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories was the crucial factor that divided the two major parties. While Republicans did not get their first choice for speaker, they nevertheless selected a member of their own party and lived to fight another day against the Slave Power. Today, Republicans in the House may face a similar set of calculations. A large majority of Republicans want McCarthy, who has been a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, but if the prolonged battles of the 1850s are any guide, they would do better to select someone who is acceptable to the entirety of their caucus. Otherwise, they risk prolonging the balloting for days, weeks or even months.  Although the politics have changed, similar dynamics are also at work in 2023 as they were in 1923. Today, a vocal conservative minority is trying to assert its power within the Republican majority and possibly emerge stronger for it. This fringe group may be dissatisfied with McCarthy, but they will need to decide whether they would rather achieve their aims under Republican leadership than remain irreconcilables unwilling to participate in governing. In 1923, the progressive Republicans were unwilling to abandon their Republican affiliation. Instead, they worked within the party structure to attempt to achieve the reforms that they desired. However, they remained a vulnerable minority whose power was eventually limited. Such may well be the fate of the Republican Party\u2019s entire agenda if they cannot find consensus in the coming days. Whatever the final number of ballots necessary to elect a speaker of the House in 2023, history tells us to get ready for a prolonged battle with ill-well rancor all around. In today\u2019s politics, Americans have sadly come to expect nothing less.",
